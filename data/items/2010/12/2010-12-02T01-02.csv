The EFF were absolutely right that the DMCA anti-circumvention provisions could be interpreted by courts to make it illegal for people to exercise rights under the doctrine of Fair Use under some circumstances.<p>But that is missing the point of what I was trying to say. The Doctrine of Fair Use is about allowing certain types of copying of copyrighted works for certain purposes.<p>The Arstechnica article talked about the judge backing down from blocking the 'fair use' defence because he mentioned that the modifications were required for homebrew.<p>My point is that homebrew does not (generally) rely on the Doctrine of Fair Use - people making and running homebrew games are generally not copying copyrighted material without the permission of the owner. It may be 'fair use' in plain English, but that would be borrowing a legal term with a specific meaning and applying it to a different meaning (this is similar, for example, to how people often use the technical term 'virus' incorrectly to talk about malware in general).",1291254950
1960654,comment,1959697,1960406,0,0,sespindola,,,"I'm not calling the USA borderline fascistic for this
incident alone, but for a sequence of events dating back
to 9/11.<p>Actually we got quite late to the postwar Nazi garage sale.
The URSS and the USA[1] got the lot, including the guy who
almost decimated London's civilian population[2].<p>The best one we could get was Kurt Tank[3].<p>ODESSA, a former SS officers organization created in 1946
to assist Nazi war criminals, had ramifications in 
Argentina. It was mostly backed here by Walther Darre's[4]
family, german companies (e.g. Siemens) and a few 
right-wing politicos.<p>Thankfully, MOSSAD was able to partially correct that black
page in our history in 1960.[5]<p>Although Peron was quite an intolerant person, he had a
soft spot for human rights and opened the doors to
Jewish inmigrants in 1946. We received 463456 jewish
inmigrants between 1947 and 1951.[6][7]<p>Also we were one of the first countries to recognize 
Israel in 1949.<p>There is one famous town founded by Germans in 1930,
Villa General Belgrano[8]. Many of their original 
inhabitants are survivors from the Graf Spee sinking[9],
although I challenge you to find a fluent German speaking
person there under the age of 80.<p>If you want to check it out, go during the first weekend of
October so you don't miss their amazing Oktoberfest.<p>All Nazi related government files have been declassified in
1992, and can be freely accessed. Although they haven't 
been digitalized.<p>After the tenths of thousands of deaths caused by our
last dictatorship[10] in the 70's, we started to develop
a politically liberal, more tolerant and more agnostic 
world view.
This led us to be the first country in Latin America to legalize gay marriage and marihuana, among other things.<p>Sorry for the excessive length of this comment, just wanted
to dispel some common myths about my country.<p>Links:

At the lowest levels they suggest that cutting foreign aid and sex education will balance the federal budget.  At the highest levels, they praise ""courageous"" budget plans like Paul Ryan's hand-waving and prayer plan to balance the budget by cutting taxes on the wealthiest and hoping that growth trickles down to all of us and health care costs magically stop rising. In between are the signs waving ""keep the government's filthy hands off my medicare,"" the epitome of Tea Party campaigning this year.<p>So the story suggests that Tea Partiers have an aversion to basic arithmetic.",1291254928

Sometimes when you are dripping wet, in the privacy of your bathroom, a scale is just perfect. That doesn't mean your scale will never talk to an app that let's you track your weigh-ins, it just means a scale is a dedicated device that people will likely want to keep for the foreseeable future.<p>But pg is dead-on on many items, as are you.

Under the U.S. legal system, prosecutors are <i>supposed</i> to (in theory, at least) be concerned with the idea of upholding justice first and foremost and only secondarily with gaining convictions. I think what probably offended the judge here most was that this prosecutor seemed bent on gaining a conviction at any cost, even if it was based on twisting the evidence and law solely to that end and regardless of whether it was right or not. In any case, at this point in this case, the prosecutor <i>can</i> simply dismiss the case and that would end it. If he does so, I doubt that any further repercussions would follow, since I don't think what he did here was so extreme as to warrant formal sanctions against him.<p>In extreme cases, prosecutors can be hit with charges of ethical misconduct and sometimes disbarred for abuse of their position.

We are looking for a Sr. Python Developer who is interested in solving some of the most pressing problems in our industry such as how to scale the enormous demand for utility computing and how to fit that within the traditional business model of a managed IT offering. With cloud servers being the most basic building block for services that Rackspace will offer, our ability to deliver on features and scalability are paramount.<p>In addition to our primary goal of building our next generation cloud offering, we are building all the necessary tools and utilities to manage and sustain an ecosystem of users and developers of the Rackspace Cloud Servers platform. CloudFiles, Drizzle, Cassandra and other tools in development will be used. 
We are looking for passionate advocates of technology. We're looking for people who don't just use these these tools and services, but people that write them. It is one thing to start a virtual machine on a host, it is another to have the curiosity to read the source code and figure out how it all works. 
We are looking to balance the ""been there, done that"" with the ""why can't we do it that way?"" mentality of thinking. The ability to challenge assumptions and conventions is important.",1291251652
