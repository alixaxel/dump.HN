Both sites require me to run a few processes and create the corresponding email newsletter and send it out on a daily basis. This usually used up all my time in the morning and I am left with just the afternoon to work on the marketing and improving the core features.<p>I hope to outsource the routine work, but with zero revenue coming in yet. It just dun make sense to outsource. I tried macros, but sadly the newsletter to be created require some analysis work.<p>Anyone else in the same shoes? What should I do? Hire VA.

Some guy told Picasso he’d pay him to draw a picture on a napkin.

During university I reached a point where I wrote everything in Emacs and appreciated the fact that whatever I was working on (Code, terminal, articles) I could switch over to something else without having to switch context in my mind. (Keyboard shortcuts, macros and formatting options stayed the same.)<p>Don't worry at the start about default options or the Right Way(tm), these things are likely to distract you to begin with. You probably will find yourself gradually adopting them. Make emacs a comfortable editor for your own way of working - It is intended to be extendible and configurable for this reason.<p>As to a module for teaching... When you run extended commands using M-x (Alt-x) it should tell you if there is a shortcut bound to that command. If it doesn't or you miss it then maybe the following functions will be helpful:<p><i>M-x where-is</i> [C-h w] Type a command and it will tell you the key shortcut (if any)<p><i>M-x describe-key</i> [C-h k] Type a key shortcut and it will tell you the command it is bound to<p><i>M-x describe-function</i> [C-h f] Provides details about the function you specify",1292406958

2007571,comment,2007385,2007455,0,0,yason,,,"This is a big part of weaseling for the benefit of the customer.<p>Back when I was still working with customer project, I noticed an inverse relation with the required effort to do a feature and the effort customers think it requires. So, they'd ask for something ""simple"" which actually involved quite a lot of changes to the code. Or alternatively the customers could be almost hesitant to suggest some other change, already fearing it would cost them dozens or hundreds of hours while I could do in half a day.<p>First I did it honestly: the simple thing was finished in a day and the customer would first be baffled and then very soon asking for more of the same, possibly feeling they had been ripped off somehow. The difficult thing took its time and the customer was waiting and complaining all the time, while I re-established that what they asked was a big change eventhough they couldn't possibly see why without knowing the source code. And they were possibly feeling they had been ripped off somehow, again.<p>Then later I changed tactics. The customers were much more happy to wait for a week or two for the easy feature which I had already coded, probably the first day. Delivering on the next week still made me ahead of schedule because the customer had their internal expectations of a much greater effort. Conversely, I checked the truly difficult problem by simply explaining that I'll do ""that easy thing"" last because it's easy and I wanted to focus on the ""that difficult effort"" first. In reality I spent the time programming the other while I was supposed to be working on the other.<p>Now, the customer reaction was totally opposite. They were very happy to see that I went through all the effort to produce the ""difficult"" thing and even if it took a week or two (because I was coding the ""easy"" thing) to deliver, they were just pleased to even get that far. After all, the ""difficult"" task was probably nearly impossible so anything I could make to work was on the surplus side. As an added bonus, they appreciated that I could still throw in the ""easy"" feature (which I had been coding all the time), despite the efforts poured into the ""difficult"" feature.<p>Moral of the story: working from the customer's perceptions keeps the customer happy, even if the actuality will sing another song. Maybe it's because customers like to be right or maybe it's because human beings like to remain fixed on ideas and preconceptions.<p>If I was a locksmith, I'd probably spend around five minutes on opening each door, making it feel long, doing manual work, and possibly talking with the customer about that particular make of lock. Not because I wanted to rip off my customers but to give them something they paid for. I suspect that many would be happier to pay $100 for five minutes of hard, manual labor than $50 for applying an automatic device for one second.<p>(I don't think I would even end up doing fewer customers per day, either, you can waste five minutes in traffic very easily.)",1292405850

It is just using declarative constructs that require imperative code in non-functional languages.<p>A great blog entry about getting started with all of this is the following: <a href=""http://blog.stefandeboey.be/34563653"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.stefandeboey.be/34563653</a><p>The author shows a functional way of achieving something and afterwards shows the Java-version of the same code.<p>As an example, say you have a List of Person-objects:<p>persons.foreach({ p => println(p.name) })<p>is the same as<p>for (p : persons)
  System.out.println(p.name);<p>What if you want to extract the persons name and have them as a list?<p>persons.map({ p => p.name })<p>the imperative version:<p>Collection<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
for (p : persons)
  names.add(p.name);<p>Note that you can omit the ""."" and ""("","")"" for method invocations in Scala, because the compiler will add them automatically.
This means that<p>persons.foreach({ p => println(p.name) })<p>can be reduced to the following:<p>persons foreach { p => println(p.name) }<p>Another nice addition is the fact that Scala adds a ""default variable name"" that represents current element of the colleciton you're iterating over. The variable to use is the underscore ""_"". This means the code can be even more concise:<p>persons map { _.name }<p>As seen above the map function is used to somewhat transform one data-representation (the persons list) into another (a list of names of these persons.<p>All you need to do to achieve this, is supply a function that helps this transformation process to perform the actual transformation step. The power lies within the fact that you dont need to give a damn about how to iterate over the persons list. You just tell Scala the ""WHAT"" and now the ""HOW"".<p>All that being said, for more information on the subject, you should definetly check out the blog post mentioned above.
