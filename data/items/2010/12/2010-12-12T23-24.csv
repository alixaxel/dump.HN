If it's the former then you're quite possibly looking at more like $1-10k. If it's the latter then set your sights higher but expect it to take a long time.<p>The bad news is that just because a company makes $10bn in revenue doesn't mean your product is necessarily worth any more to them than it is to a company generating <£1 million, especially if it's only loosely linked to revenue or closely substituted for by alternatives. Where big companies do pay more it's usually because the scale of the solution being offered is much bigger.<p>Are there logical units/brackets related to your product offering (per licensed user, per store, per product, per client, per purchase, per click, % revenue generated)? If so, what sort of bracket or average number of users does a smaller client use, and how much do you charge them for it? If it's easy to charge directly per unit, do that. If it isn't, you'll have to gauge expected usage (by asking the client) and give yourself scope to renegotiate at the end of the billing period (preferably six months to a year) if they underestimate. They'll also expect a volume discount compared with smaller companies in lower brackets, but how much they get really ought to depend on two things: 
(i) marginal costs to you - how much does each additional user/product etc cost to you in terms of support time, computer resources, transaction fees etc.
(ii) marginal benefit to them - will they get the additional value from having it for every salesperson/customer/product or is it something where the benefit is automatically companywide and most extra licenses/options are just a nice-to-have",1292198368

They're <i>so</i> much cheaper in much of Europe, and probably even more so in Asia. Competition is so fierce that calls here tend to be cheaper than the termination fees the network operators pay each other for routing the calls to one another. And they're still making massive profits.<p>I don't know why this is, by the way. A big problem is that the frequency bands are a finite resource which rarely makes it back onto the market once sold. The other issue is that a network with limited geographical coverage isn't as competitive; these two facts caused the ""land grabs"" when the GSM and 3G frequencies were being sold in various European countries. New players haven't joined the fray outside those periods; LTE doesn't seem to have introduced any new players, probably because the markets are now oversaturated and well served. The infrastructure investment would be immense. There <i>are</i> new resellers who rent access to the big networks, though.<p>Still, most countries seem to have 3-5 national operators, and competition among them is alive and well in many cases.

In Haskell F is the type constructor of the monad, the unit is called return and the multiplication is usually called join (and in the case of the list monad is also known as concat).<p>(Note that the definition of monoid needed here is not that of a set with associative binary operation, but the more general ""monoid object in a monoidal category"". Instead of a set S and a multiplication S x S->S, where x denotes cartesian product, we want a functor F and a multiplication F o F->F where o denotes composition.
