I build integrated products (mobile app which talks to a few web apps and maybe a desktop app in there too). I'm not a web developer sitting there making a site a human uses a great deal of the time.<p>You're 9.5 weeks into a 10 week project. Some changes need to be made to a view cause a race condition was found in a load in the client application that talks to your framework.<p>If you're a rails guy, and you get the feature request, you go ""What do I have to change to fix that"" <time passes> ""Magic happend, it all works"". You don't really have the ability always to twiddle the current output in some random way required to just get the comms working with the client and the system incrementally integrated with the world.<p>If you're the django guy, you go"" Let me stick the output you want for now in the view, okay, does that work? cool I'll add some dynamic stuff, Okay cool, does it still work, I'll go do that the right way"".<p>If you work in a position where you sometimes need to do the second one, but largely can behave like an adult and follow the correct ways to do the rest of the time, Django will be more rewarding to you than Rails, as you can get away with building that last mile out of earwax and sticky tack if you want to on Django, but on rails, you really have to used that same deliberate hand carved ivory you used everywhere else.<p>Which project is going to be purtier when you're done? Rails for sure! Which one is going to be easier to expand off of? Probably rails will take less time to get to the next version, as there will be no cleanup time to take out the sticky tack. Can you hack the crap out of something when you need to pop something out the door for the demo tommorrow? It really really varies upon what the hack is you need to pull. With Django it doesn't. That's the issue. That's what I mean about ""willing to just get it done"".<p>By willing to just get it done, I mean take the immediate pre-ship shortcuts and workarounds that you have to do often to ship on time. Rails abhors a shortcut or an abridgment. I think it has <i>very large strengths</i> for a lot of people. But for others, working in certain types of jobs, I find this insistance of ""not going off the rails"" infuriating.<p>Yes, I know if you're a ruby god whos' done rails for a very long time, and knows exactly how everything works, you CAN do this sort of thing. I've worked with some of you actually. I think you guys are cool. But the general ROR guy can't. The general Django guy can.<p>Django is a 18 wheeler truck and Rails a freight train. They do different things well. But damn, you crash if you take that train off the rails, but you can survive offroading in that truck for a bit to make that delivery at a weird stop.",1292046867

The parable in the story touches on both of these issues: trying hard, and the struggle to please management.<p>A third issue that's perhaps more important:  you need to find the work fulfilling for your own reasons.

1994267,comment,1993901,1994137,0,0,gte910h,,,">Ruby is just fine for ""just wanting to get it done""<p>Yeah, I explicitly said ROR there because its the web framework which is annoying when you want to ship. I think the language is pretty neat actually, 'cept doesn't have as many libs.<p>>But. If you have even the slightest difference of opinion with Rails as to how to handle a request or represent the URL parameters you're getting from browsers, you're in for a world of hurt.<p>Yeah, sometimes that ""way rails thinks you should"" is considerably more complicated than what you'd have to do on a PHP or Djagno project to just get that last mile in. I'm currently finishing up a iOS SDK/library that talks to both a rails and django backend, and while the ROR dev is more available, he often has to figure out the right ways to change things that the Django guy just splats out if he has to(and cleans up after we're integrated). The ROR solutions are often frustratingly complicated (want to add a field to this view? Naw you can't, we have to instead change the datamodel of that object and sorry we can't name this that thing you already put in the client, etc). We don't care about long term whatever this week. We just want a certain URL scheme and certain output to happen NOW so we can integrate the last couple chunks in before our announced press event hits us, then backfill with quality code at that URL later. It might just be I know the ruby dev better, but he seems he's probably the better programmer of the two as well (but I don't know the Django guy well).<p>Sure the rails methodology might be better if you are the type of the person who doesn't do things the right way when you're not forced to , but if you are the type who does things correctly, the Django is no more correct or less correct and canonical, except for those instances when where you just have to finish. So if we're adults, we can write good code most of the time and good enough code when we have to and get away with it on Django. On rails, yeah right. There was a Plone developer who said something once like ""Python believes we're all consenting adults"". I feel python web frameworks do, and ROR doesn't. (link to the AWESOME talk:<a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/SeanKellyRecoveryfromAddiction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archive.org/details/SeanKellyRecoveryfromAddictio...</a>)<p>If I wanted bureaucracy, I'd go do a java serverlet. Rails feels more like religious doctrine enforced in code than bureaucracy, but it has that stink of java's ""thou shalt use the X to do the Y or DEATH AND INFAMY will result"". It's not an overwhelming stick mind you, but a slight odor.<p>Ruby on Rails DOES work. It just is frustrating in that it does not allow shortcuts, ever. Therefore, I feel it keeps you away from your kids before a commitment, where Django doesn't. I'm not saying ""don't ever use it"", and I dont' think people who KNOW rails will get enough out of swapping to do the swap, but if you know neither now, I'd go python/django.<p>Then again, if you're new to programming, the copious beware/here be dragons of ROR might be a better path to get used to not slacking.",1292045837

1994227,comment,1992433,1992433,0,0,curiousyogurt,,,"I made the jump from Objective-C/Cocoa development to web app development after Startup School this year.  Two things surprised me when I really got down to coding my initial project.  First, the sheer number of technologies involved in developing my web app.  For me, that's Ruby on Rails, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, HTML, CSS.<p>Second, the lack of integration between the various technologies was surprising.  I often knew what I wanted a particular page to do, and the solution was to learn a new technology, and then figure out how to shuffle data between the new technology and those technologies I was already using.<p>Integration problems also crop up in the form of mismatches between technologies.  For example, I use bignum integers in my code; but ran into all sorts of interesting problems: Ruby/Sqlite work fine; but as soon as I uploaded the app to Heroku, I uncovered issues with how these integers were being stored in the PostgreSQL.  And Javascript needs special routines if it is going to handle bignums.  I haven't encountered this sort of mismatch on the desktop.<p>That said, now that I've got a working app, I think the learning curve was in some ways (though not all ways) less steep than the desktop.  A couple of reasons for this, I think:<p>1) The communities share code prolifically.  It is not that there is no code sharing going on in desktop development, but code sharing seems much more prevalent in web development.  As a new web developer, this makes my job a lot easier not only because I can just plug in code, but also because I can read that code and learn from it.<p>2) You can get minimal results quite quickly, which is very encouraging.  Again, you can get minimal results quickly on the desktop, but the standards are different on the web.  In my experience, a desktop app needs a lot more to be minimally functional than a web app, probably because the level of complexity is different.  Yes, web apps can be just as complex as desktop apps; but I think a minimally functional web app is in many ways less complex than a minimally functional desktop app.  Just think about all the menus, help files, and other accoutrements you need to get a desktop app minimally functional; web apps can get away with less.<p>3) The web technologies I depend on are more modern.  Compared to Objective-C/Cocoa, Ruby is like a dream.  Javascript and  less so, but only because it seems more like what I'm used to on the desktop.  What can I say, I like syntactic sugar and the readability that comes with it.<p>So, perhaps web programming is hard, but there are several ways travelling the path is made easier - maybe even easier than on the desktop.",1292044038
