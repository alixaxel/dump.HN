I've reposted it below so it's accessible.<p>-- Quoted Text --<p>Updated Statement about WikiLeaks from PayPal General Counsel, John Muller<p>December 8, 2010<p>Media reports today regarding a statement made by our vice president of platform, mobile and new ventures, Osama Bedier, at the LeWeb conference in Paris, have created confusion about PayPal’s decision to permanently restrict the account that was raising funds for WikiLeaks. We want to set the record straight.<p>As a global payment service that moves billions of our customers’ funds across borders and across jurisdictions, we are required to comply with laws around the world.  Compliance with these laws is something we take very seriously.  PayPal’s Acceptable Use Policy states that we do not allow any organization to use our service if it encourages, promotes, facilitates or instructs others to engage in illegal activity.  This policy is part of an agreement we’ve made with our account holders and with the companies that allow us to process global payments.  It’s also an important part of our commitment to protect our customers and to ensure our business can continue operating around the world.<p>In 2008 and 2009, PayPal reviewed and restricted the account associated with WikiLeaks for reasons unrelated to our Acceptable Use Policy.  As soon as proper information was received from the account holder, the restrictions were lifted.<p>The account was again reviewed last week after the U.S. Department of State publicized a letter to WikiLeaks on November 27, stating that WikiLeaks may be in possession of documents that were provided in violation of U.S. law.  PayPal was not contacted by any government organization in the U.S. or abroad. We restricted the account based on our Acceptable Use Policy review.  Ultimately, our difficult decision was based on a belief that the WikiLeaks website was encouraging sources to release classified material, which is likely a violation of law by the source.<p>While the account will remain restricted, PayPal will release all remaining funds in the account to the foundation that was raising funds for WikiLeaks.<p>We understand that PayPal’s decision has become part of a broader story involving political, legal and free speech debates surrounding WikiLeaks’ activities. None of these concerns factored into our decision. Our only consideration was whether or not the account associated with WikiLeaks violated our Acceptable Use Policy and regulations required of us as a global payment company. Our actions in this matter are consistent with any account found to be in violation of our policies.",1291857176

You would need a full-fledged signal processor to do this, but I could imagine a box that did this (I could definitely build one myself, but I'm not strong enough in analog electronics to say with confidence that it would work at higher pixel frequencies; I've never done a project with analog signals over 100MHz)<p>[edit] So to answer the grandparent, it is possible; such a box would be expensive (read definitely more than $10, possibly a lot more) though.",1291856689

So many cost saving ventures would have been out of the question for companies due to image (What?
