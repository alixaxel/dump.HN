2044327,comment,2043582,2043582,0,0,Andrew_Quentin,,,"The article fails to define merit, perhaps, because, it is extremely hard to define in practical and objective ways.<p>Failing such definition, any arguments can be made, but they will not necessarily be about merits, but maybe about agendas or thoughts or beliefs or simply opinions that the author has.<p>Let me take education as the only example. It states that people ""tend to"" get the education of their class, that is rich people private and ivory league, middle class public and public universities and the poor inner cities schools and no university. Now, the word ""tend to"" is extremely important. It acknowledges that it is not a rule or anywhere close to it, but somewhat the norm. So that, most people, say 80% do so. Why do the 20% not however? Might it be because the inner city poor kid is intelligent enough and has the right attitude to focus on his studies and go to university? And might it be that the rich guy does not and drifts off into a world of drugs and depression?<p>Merit is a quality which we define almost to be a prerequisite for success. We know it when we see it, but, to define it, is hard. In the absence of such definition, then, I really can not criticise the article because many of the points it makes may be correct in one view, but quite wrong in another.<p>Lets take inheritance. Of course a rich person has many benefits, money, the right attitude, the culture as the article defines it, or, nowing the rules of the game. So, seeing as this kid has all of this, then, does not whatever he acquires means that he did so because of merit? Or are we trying to define merit in the way of inherent intelligence, that is, we are all born with a certain equal number of merit, thus, there should be an equal number of poor people in each state. Or is merit a highly complex phenomena, blind indeed to your environment at times, and quite susceptible to it at other times.<p>I think, for me, merit is this certain quality which does contain ambition, intelligence, high self awareness, and perceptive attitude, a tendency to use reason and logics, as well as environmental factors such as a warm and loving family and others. The combination of this all is that you have these certain attitudes which make you competent and able and willing to do certain things which may lead to achievement and higher earning potential and above all, it gives you the ability to be in control of your environment and control it when things go out of control or try your hardest to do so with all your might and ability and get back on your feet.",1293501490

It is very hard to pitch Android to someone who is not tech savy, simply because of the choppy and sluggish UI.  This has also become the talk of the masses, most people who haven't even used Android say the following:  ""I've seen Android, its cool, but its not as smooth and stable as the iPhone.""   The iPhone's hardware fails a lot (I've exchanged my 3Gs twice in less than a year), it also freezes at times and drops calls, but what do people see and remember!?
