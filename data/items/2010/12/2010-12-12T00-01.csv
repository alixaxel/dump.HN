Our lawyer warned us that if we ever wanted to go to Wall Street and become public, then a standard C form corp was far more appropriate. And you can not easily transition from LLC to C form corp. Our lawyer told us that the IRS would treat is as liquidation sale and tax everything we had - in other words, it would never make rational sense to do this. It would be as if our LLC went broke and was liquidated and then was bought by the new C form corp.<p>When we closed down that LLC, there was intellectual property we had to entangle, so that it could go back to belonging to various individuals, all of whom were continuing with their careers. This was messy. We had a highly customized partnership agreement for our LLC. That is the great thing about LLCs - that they allow such flexibility (this, too, varies state by state in the USA. Virginia allows a great deal of flexibility). My advice is, if you form an LLC with other people, put in a clause about shutting down. Essentially, negotiate a pre-nup.

1996024,comment,1994890,1995142,0,0,sedachv,,,"""Much cheaper than a sailboat.""<p>You'd be surprised. Where I'm currently at (Montreal) there's a lot of 40-year old ~21 foot sailboats going for $3-4k. Me and a buddy planned to buy something this summer, but he spent his share of the money on travel. I was too lazy to learn to sail and don't like carpentry and other crap that goes into maintaining a boat, so I decided not to get a boat by myself.<p>Even when you factor in repairs, harbor fees and the possibility of having to write the boat off after 1-2 years because it's spending all its time in the water (most of the boats we looked at were dry docked for most of their existence), it's still cheaper than rent.<p>About touring bikes, it really doesn't matter what you tour on. I've known people who've toured on Wal-Mart bikes (not a good idea), 70s 5-speed bikes, track bikes (also not a good idea), double-stack welded tallbikes, etc. There was even a guy riding a BMX <i>backwards</i> across the USA for charity.<p>I have a bunch of friends that swear by the LHT, but I like to tour on late 80s-early 90s rigid-fork steel mountain bikes (all the rigid-fork mountain bikes made today are suspension-corrected, which makes them useless for just about anything). On mountain bikes the rear rack sits lower and handling gets smoother as the rear is loaded, which isn't always the case with road-type frames. This means you can go with rear panniers only, which is great because front panniers really mess up handling. As a plus 26"" wheels and tires can be found almost anywhere, and are usually stronger than 700s.",1292113758

1996011,comment,1994890,1994890,0,0,ssskai,,,"To anyone who is thinking about doing this, I highly recommend it.<p>When I was younger, my family sold most of what we owned, rented out our house, and moved onto our sailboat.  We sailed from Seattle to San Diego, then down the West Coast of Mexico, and up into the Sea of Cortez.  We were only planning on being gone one year, but since it was such an amazing experience, we decided to extend our trip for a second year.<p>On the second year, we sailed from the Sea of Cortez farther down Mexico, then down to El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, through the Panama Canal, over to Colombia, up to Honduras, Belize, Mexico again, then Florida.  This second year was certainly more rushed since we visited so many countries, but we need to get back stateside for me to finish school and go to college.<p>Many people believe it is unsafe and expensive to do such an extended trip.  But if you are friendly to the local people and accept their culture, they are often welcoming and friendly.  Never once were we approached by pirates (although the Mexican navy did stop us 100+ miles off the coast before leaving Mexico to enter El Sal, boarded our boat with AK47s and searched for drugs.  Obvi nothing was there and they left).  In fact, many welcomed us because we helping to boost their economy, and would improve their image as a ""tourist"" town.<p>As for expenses, living on a boat is extremely cheap if you are mechanically inclined.  Granted, the boat is a big investment, but other than that there aren't too many expenses.  We used solar panels for electricity, a mini-desalinazation machine for drinking water, and often fished off the side, catching fresh tuna.  The only expenses were diesel fuel and food (which is cheap in 3rd world countries!).  Occasionally we docked, but that was also cheap (we stayed at a high-end resort in MX, including 3 pools and a personal zoo with tigers, and we paid $20/ day).  Also, since our home was being rented, that provided some monthly income with no work.<p>The one danger, and it is very serious, is when people have a lack of offshore sailing and boat handling experience.  When (not if) you encounter bad weather you've gotta know how to properly manage the boat, be it at anchor or in the middle of the ocean.  I've seen boats slam into rocks during storms in port, and heard captain's calling for help because they're boat is sinking far from shore.  However, with some training near shore and a few trips to sea with experienced sailors, most anyone can learn what is necessary to take on an extended sailing voyage.<p>Also, for all you who need a constant internet connection, rig up an amplified wireless router. We bought an industrial antenna, mounted it halfway up the mast, and rigged up a signal amplifier.  In our home harbor, this lead to an increase from 3 wifi networks to over 35 wifi networks! Usually had about a dozen free networks from local businesses.<p>When we returned home to Seattle, we simply moved back into our original home, met up with old friends, and had some great tales to tell.",1292113503

There are a lot of gotchas (background thread, if you wanted distance-based section headers...) that could only be learned by hands-on coding.
