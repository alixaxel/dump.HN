Someone please tell me what the record labels have done to deserve 75% of the cut. The majority of the music I listen to I found on my own either by pirating music or finding it on my own on the web. We haven't ""won"" until these middle men are cut completely out of the loop.<p>And to be honest, even then I probably wouldn't pay for music. I wlll pay for t-shirts, stickers, or concert tickets, but not songs these artists couldn't give away when they were first starting out. One of the most enduring examples of hypocrisy in this whole music pirating debacle will be Metallica raging against the very practice that made them popular in the first place - people dubbing tapes of their music for their friends.<p>The only thing that makes music worth anything is popularity and the only way to make music popular is to give it away for free in the beginning. Given that there's an infinite supply, how does it make any sense that it can be worthless in one instant and $1 a pop in another? This insanity needs to stop, and I guarantee that it will some day. The easier it becomes to produce and promote music, games, movies, software, etc, the harder and harder it is going to be to justify charging anything for it.",1291265935

I love Grooveshark, but it's so good at giving you what you want for free that it seems a bit like piracy in the cloud. I think the reality is that piracy and legal obtainment coexist and are a bit more ambiguous now, rather than fighting for the total extermination of the other.",1291265927

1961041,comment,1959782,1960374,0,0,bpyne,,,"I think comfort zone plays a part in IT developers seeming uninterested in ""new"" ideas. Closer to the heart of the problem IMO is that most business applications are just not very interesting. You can reduce them to: take input values from screen, run SQL query, and post query results back to the screen. Writing good SQL is the most challenging part.<p>In order for apps to be more interesting - making new ideas in IT appealing - businesses must be willing to re-examine their processes and change them with an eye towards better automation and some business intelligence. However, getting a single department in a business to change its processes is as monumental as changing global warming.<p>Of course, another issue altogether is COTS reducing the applications actually written in-house. Making intellectual investments in powerful programming languages is just not sound when a developer is simply writing ""glue"" code between vendor systems.<p>People do generally get jazzed up in IT departments when new technologies come around. Sure, there are technological curmudgeons, but very few. Enthusiasm gets dampened when it is clear that a good business case cannot be made for the new technology.<p>(I used ""new"" relative to an IT department's current environment and not in reference to age of the technology.)",1291265201

So, you might say ""my computer seems a little slow today,"" but since the malware wouldn't be infecting the Windows computers, there'd be no alerts on their IDS.<p>The preceding scenario is a ridiculously contrived and unlikely event.<p>The truth is that the BSD kernel underneath OS X has a lot more security credibility than does Windows. Furthermore, since OS X has a lower market share than Windows, it is less likely that malware creators will target it. This does not make you immune from hacking, but since you are directly comparing your situation with Windows alternatives, I think it's fair.<p>Additionally, OS X these days is very inter-operable, so I wouldn't really worry about IT compatibility too much.<p>The biggest concern I'd have is convincing them that it's worth triple the cost of its Dell counterpart.

Schultz.<p>My response will be relatively short, and I feel compelled to explain why.<p>You wrote thirteen paragraphs.  The first two are rhetorical metadiscourse.  The next three are implied arguments against a straw man.  In the sixth paragraph you actually attempted to make an argument, it appears, but you only violently agreed with my point (""everyone agrees too many things are classified"").  The next six paragraphs consist of irrelevant information probably copied and pasted.  In the last paragraph alone do you make a claim which actually merits my response.<p>Your claim that the state department ""spent the last week clean[ing] up...diplomatic brush fires"" is completely unsubstantiated.  I've seen little evidence that ""cablegate"" has caused anything more than mild embarrassment of government officials and a media bonanza.<p>Your only real contention worth a response is ""[Documents are] not wrongfully classified when the definition of restricted is that it impedes your ability to do the job"".  Part of the government's job is explaining itself and its actions to its citizens: it reports to us, because it exists by our consent.  Classification and secrecy exists not so the government won't be required to account for its actions, but in order to protect the lives of the citizens who consent to its existence.  According to your interpretation of ""restricted"" the government should classify all potentially embarrassing information which might be construed negatively by the citizenry, and frankly, I don't think I need an argument to demonstrate the bankruptcy of that claim: given the usual incompetency of the government your principle, taken to its logical conclusion, would have the government classifying nearly everything.",1291264474

They had to be brought kicking and screaming to that particular table.<p>In this whole thing, what's funny to me is that the solution to the whole issue was known as soon as Napster got big - make all the songs available, and make them cheap, and most people will stop bothering with pirated music.  I know I got bored with pirated music about a week after starting it.<p>Personally, in the fullness of time, the record companies will come to love digital music.  There's one less middleman taking a cut, no inventory to worry about, and new ideas, cross promotions and artists can be brought to market and tested faster than ever.  The biggest losers appear to be the people who did album art, but maybe with the high quality screens of digital devices, they'll find new ways to show their talent.<p>But digital music will always have it's roots in piracy, something that will end up as a trivia nugget in years to come, kind of like how people talk about how NASCAR got going because of bootleggers running moonshine.

Would it be OK for me to smash to device to bits with a big fucking hammer?  If so, I feel it's also OK to use a soldering iron to make it read non-special discs, too.  Can you play pirated games with that mod?  Yup.  But consider this: it's legal to own a handgun, and even in unmodified form, you can use that gun to kill as many people as you want.  Kill.  Take away their life.  Forever.  And society is fine with people owning those, because they know that if someone kills as many people as they want to (and that number is more than 0), they will be brought to justice.  It's worth letting that one psycho have a gun if it means everyone else can hunt animals or protect their families; that's what society has decided.  Similarly, people should always be free to tinker with their devices (and even other people's devices, with those people's permission) because the potential positive value to society (a cheap workstation for elementary school computer labs) outweighs the potential negative value to society (someone playing Kill Zombies XXXIV without paying MegaGameCorp $85).  Mod chips don't kill game companies, people do.<p>(Don't get me started on why the government thinks it's OK to put people in prison for growing certain plants in their own homes.
