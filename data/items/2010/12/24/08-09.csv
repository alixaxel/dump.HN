English is not the first language in India and with the kind of diversity India has I am sure it never will be the first language. But it is the common platform for people to communicate. Same is the case with other languages. We are talking while living in a much broader perspective now, where people are looking forward to work with each other and gain, rather than rule each other. So, just because some event happened in past, its not necessary that it will happen again.<p>And while I am at it, let me say that this human kindness has not evolved on its own. We are living in a nuclear age, so for one person/country to dominate others it it will take millions of life and an entire economic era to fall down.<p>So from current standing of the world, thinking that there will be one major global event which will suddenly change the way we live is a little imaginary, unless we are ready to sacrifice ourselves.<p>China is one of the fastest growing economies and there is no denial to the fact the Chinese language will spread once the trade has more open face but at the same time no one else has stopped (US and other English speaking countries). So languages might co-exist but replacing English is far from truth.<p>I truly wish that more n more languages attain a global status. This will just add to the learning.",1293180658

I'm pretty idealistic, like to promote egalitarianism, etc.  On the other hand, there is value to having context, to having someone ""vetted"" so to speak, and so on.<p>Talking about my personal accomplishments (in terms of getting myself well) often falls on deaf ears.  Why? Because it is so far outside the experience of others with my diagnosis that they just can't relate to it.  I sound like some nutcase.  I get called a charlatan, liar and snake oil salesman.  And I might never get anywhere with it because I really want the information to stand on its own and not get ""sold"" based on personal charm/popularity -- and that is undermining my ability to speak about it at all because other people are chasing popularity and doing all in their power to shape what can and can't be discussed through social influence of a sort that I loathe.<p>I have thought about writing up some stuff about moderating forums and talking about the importance of creating a forum with ""gravity"" rather than ""magnetism"".  As most folks here probably know, gravity is a quality space not objects.  If gravity were a property of objects, it would work like magnetism and all your planets would clump together with the sun or something like that -- like the big mess you find in a typical kitchen junk drawer where a magnet has gotten tossed in with paper clips and scissors and such.  And life as we know it just wouldn't exist.<p>I am not entirely clear how to create ""gravity"" as part of the social space and take some of the emphasis off the ""magnetism"" of important members.  Yet, even though gravity is a property of space, some objects have higher gravity (due to size, etc) than others and therefore exert more pull.  How to clearly distinguish the two things and make sure you are encouraging gravity over magnetism is something I am a bit less clear on -- at least at the moment, a tad shy of 4am.",1293180632

More interestingly, the crime rate in the US does not significantly differ from that in other countries[1]. Even taking the statistics from [1] at face value (they are probably skewed by various different definitions for 'crime'), The Netherlands has the same crime rate as the US, yet the prison population is six times smaller (per capita)[2].

Scrolling itself takes 2 seconds minimum. You also haven't mentioned the time it takes to open that second file (to open a parallel window with another file costs me 1 keystroke to open the window, another keystroke to invoke ""find"", and 4-5 keystrokes to type a keyword).<p>In Emacs scrolling, highlighting and cut/pasting that function does take me at most 2 seconds (the total time): mostly because I don't have to scroll, almost never, as I jump through the file by doing searches, which in Emacs are really cheap and intuitive, with great shortcuts.<p>Highlighting is also a lot faster for me:<p>You have to drag down the mouse cursor, while holding the left button, being careful to not select too much or less. That alone can take 2 seconds. What I do is to get to the start of the block (again, shortcuts for jumping in Emacs are great), mark the start of a selection, then jump again (here I don't even have to search, since I can jump to the closing bracket). So highlighting a block costs ~ 6 keystrokes (including search), and takes me less then a second because these shortcuts are already hardwired.<p>Also, when copy/pasting text Emacs remembers everything you ever copied in your current session (the kill-ring); if you copied something a couple of minutes ago, there's no reason to return and copy it again. This and other niceties like ... being able to UNDO anything, even previous UNDO operations, or being able to UNDO operations only in a selected region of text, make it the ultimate text editor for me.<p>Also, working with windows in Emacs could use some work, but buffers are great.",1293180077

We've been assaulted with Assange/WikiLeaks stories, where government officials are calling for assassinations, scramble to find existing/create new laws to prevent their dirty laundry being known to public. US is waging two unjust, unprovoked wars, started under made up pretenses (and that only few years after Vietnam disaster). Health care costs are spiraling out of control in US, while at the same time the quality of service is bad. Broadband in US is worse than in South Korea. Law making process is out of control, with mega-bills stuffed with unrelated rules bought by lobbying. War on drugs, terrorizing war on terror, prisons population out of control (compared to other countries). I could go on (and no, other countries are no better in that regard).<p>What I like about that talk is that it talks about governments serving the people. On paper that's what it is but in practice the government is the master and it behaves like one. The government has all the power and the way it feels is that it is on a relentless drive to get even more power and it's a rare act of short lived triumph where some of its power is stripped away and sanity restored. The examples of power grab abound (expanding search and seizure at borders and in the airports, trying to silence whistle-blowers by e.g. bullying private sector, criminalizing behavior like recording police at work (so that they can abuse their power more freely), unconditionally accepting content industry propaganda about terrible losses from piracy and enacting censorship legislations that try to go around due process).<p>So no, things are far from being good and I for one would welcome a government that tries to serve its people in reality, not just on paper.",1293179940

Most interesting medical paragraph in the piece:<p><i>ONE OF THE COMMON PITFALLS for clinicians who treat type two diabetes occurs when they prescribe metformin to young women. Metformin decreases insulin resistance, which helps reduce blood sugar. Insulin resistance is also what causes infertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, as well as type two diabetes. Often, women thought to be infertile become pregnant after taking metformin. Sometimes, of course, this delights them, but sometimes it does not. Contraception does not normally seem like one of the things diabetes doctors need to emphasize. But obesity commonly underlies infertility in women, just as it also causes the growth of facial hair. And, in men, the growth of breast tissue. Adipose tissue secretes estrogens and insulin resistance increases levels of androgens. Diabetes is overwhelmingly the most common cause of male impotence in the developed world. Men and women are designed to move, and when we do not, our immobility reduces us in every respect.</i><p>Most interesting non-medical paragraph:<p><i>THE OLDEST of the bowhead whales in the Arctic Ocean have lived for two hundred years. We know this because when they are killed and examined today, we find ivory harpoon heads lodged in their skin. The implication is that they were large enough to be hunted prior to the arrival of the Hudson Bay Company and its steel harpoon heads in the 1830s. Isotopic analysis of the whales’ eyes confirms the point: these whales were calves during the Napoleonic Wars. They are certainly the longest-lived mammals on the planet.

There's great variation from one extreme to the other, but otherwise there are smooth clusters around particular areas.<p>The point of this project is to create a <i>startup</i> country, a place where greater risk--in terms of the system used, not necessarily within the system--can mean greater reward. Yes, Thiel is a libertarian, but TSI quite explicitly concentrates on enabling anyone to partake of their output. This isn't Galt's Gulch in the Water, nor is it intended to (maybe in Thiel's private dreams, but definitely not in the way TSI is run).<p>I'd love to find out if the common modes of living we're used to are local maxima, or if we'll find that the various experiments converge again towards familiar clusters.<p>To be content with what's out there is the same as saying ""well, pick one of the many companies out there and join as an employee. What's the point of starting your own company?""",1293178400

With a mouse I can scroll two pages, highlight and replace a function in about two seconds. It would take me far longer to do this using keyboard shortcuts.<p>Most of my time spent coding isn't spent on navigation of text files anyway. Most code is very modular and I switch between text files frequently. In an IDE, you have a navigational tree of your files from which you can find and switch to a different file in about two seconds.<p>Does anyone have any evidence that vim is <i>actually</i> faster at these two things, and not just hype? If not evidence, at least solutions to the above two problems which you think are faster than using an IDE?",1293177717
