There's a reference to a previous boycott over Amazon that happened a few years ago around Amazon not showing some GLBTetc-friendly items, and was resolved because enough people supported it. In the case of WikiLeaks I'm fairly certain that those who would even care that Amazon wouldn't continue hosting WikiLeaks would still be a large portion of an online-based population that cares that WikiLeaks exists at all. Not exactly an issue that affects most homes or families in a direct manner. WikiLeaks went to Amazon for hosting, Amazon said yes then was pressured out of it, WikiLeaks found other hosting.

In Canada we've realized we can't entirely eliminate crime, because many of the more drastic measures to ""get tough on crime"" have harmful side-effects that take us further away from the ideal society, not closer towards it.<p>We take the same arguments towards cigarettes, alcohol, automobile speeding, and children in swimming pools. Draconian measures that would increase our safety--like banning tobacco, prohibition, stringent requirements to obtain and maintain a license to drive, or banning personal swimming pools--actually move us away from our ideal society, not closer.<p>We have to ""Play God"" and agree that someone, somewhere, must die as a result of terrorism. We as a society already do that with our respective health care systems, with our automobils, with the sale of alcohol and tobacco, with the sale of guns, by allowing children to swim in swimming pools,and the ridiculous ease with which we allow people to obtain and drive vehicles.<p>The ultimate goal is to define what it means to be a Canadian or an American and then to live as much of that life as possible.

1963597,comment,1962846,1963369,0,0,jerf,,,"""but they're pointing out that it does show that forms of life different from our current definitions can exist""<p>Yes, but not <i>meaningfully</i> different from previous definitions. If this is simply an evolution of existing earth life, then it's just another in a long list of things that we were surprised evolved from conventional Earth life, but is, nevertheless, conventional Earth life. It's more indicative of a <i>slight flaw</i> in our definitions, not time for a radical reexamination of our assessment of the universe.<p>As I commented in a previous message, people have a history of getting far more excited about this sort of thing than they have scientific justification for. This sure looks like another one of those.<p>Now, if they could establish that this has to be the actual entirely new branch of life that can be provably not traced back to the same Earth ancestor as everything else, <i>that</i> would be a groundshaking discovery.<p>Those of us pondering the Great Questions were already not assuming that everything has to look exactly like known Earth life to work. There are numerous obvious different, incompatible mechanism that could exist (different RNA transcription tables, the other chirality for proteins) and an unknown and presumably vastly larger number of unobvious different mechanisms even just for basically Earth life before we really go out into new territory. We've already speculated endlessly about silicon life, ammonia life, mechanisms other than photosynthesis, etc. Don't get me wrong, this is legitimately <i>interesting</i>, and would on its own be worthy of HN, but I have to say the implications for the Great Questions are basically zip. Announcing proof that life can <i>only</i> exist in precisely Earthlike conditions with incredibly tight tolerances would be the surprise.",1291323011

And yet I've had competent programmers that I ran ask me how I got to be so good. Truth is I'm probably middle of the road - I know plenty I look up to, and plenty I could teach. Hell, my mom can program (she writes her own shell scripts at times).<p>I think the practice of ""write this program before we'll talk to you"" is largely driven by technical staff who don't understand how to run an interview where a discussion of theory and practice can suss out someone who doesn't actually have the experience.

HPNS seems to be caused by rapid changes in the partial pressure of helium, so it can be alleviated somewhat by using less helium and replacing it with nitrogen.<p>COMEX (a French commercial diving company) has done successful working dives to beyond 1,700 feet on hydroheliox, a mixture of 49% hydrogen, 50% helium, and 1% oxygen. However, there are major practical issues with breathing a hydrogen mixture--namely, if you have hydrogen and oxygen together at high pressure with more than a tiny fraction of oxygen, it will explode. This makes it only practical to use a hydrogen mixture at a depth great enough where 1% oxygen is a high enough partial pressure to sustain consciousness.<p>Also, hydrogen at high partial pressures is said to have a narcotic effect similar to LSD, but permanent.",1291320516

We've got things like WebGL and Google Native Client, but they're immature and can't yet be strung together to easily make something like a 3d content creation app. Amazon's EC2 now offers GPGPU instances, but there are no frameworks to help me port my scientific computing app to use EC2 as a backend and WebGL as a front-end. (And I'd be out of luck if I wanted to visualize a resulting data set that exceeded 4GB: I'd have to shift all or part of the rendering pipeline to the cloud, and WebGL means it would be all or nothing.) It also seems a bit absurd that we still need something more than a web browser to do web development.<p>The other big thing lacking is integration: I can't save a Google Doc directly to my Dropbox account, proper OpenID support isn't widespread, when Photoshop does come to the cloud, I definitely won't be able to upload directly to Picasa and Flickr, and nobody seems to be interested in enabling the seamless (secure) sharing of data between web apps.",1291320212
