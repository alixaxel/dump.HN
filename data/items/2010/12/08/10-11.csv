1982472,comment,1981863,1982058,0,0,gjm11,,,"> the public is being brainwashed into thinking that science is more important than creative endeavors<p>1. They aren't.<p>2. Science <i>is</i> a creative endeavour.<p>3. If people believe that science is more important than creative endeavours then perhaps it's because science has brought us machines that allow us to fly, little magic boxes you can carry in your pocket that let you talk to someone thousands of miles away, the ability to have sex with a reasonable confidence of not making babies, other little pocket-sized boxes that will capture and replay highly realistic moving pictures, large bridges that don't fall down, people walking on the fucking moon, devices that can see into your body and tell whether you have cancer, other devices that can kill the cancer inside your body if so, things cheap enough for almost everyone to own that will let you travel five times faster than a fast runner for long distances, etc., etc., etc. What you call ""creative endeavours"" have produced wonderful things too, but if I had to choose between <i>Hamlet</i> and antibiotics I'll go for the millions of lives saved.<p>> Why is nature more interesting than the human imagination?<p>More <i>interesting</i>? Well, that's a separate question. To many people it isn't. Those to whom it is have all sorts of different reasons. One would be that nature has a lot more in it than the human imagination. (""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy"", as one of those creative types made one of his characters say -- though he meant something else.) Another would be that human imagination is limited by, well, human imagination, whereas nature is full of things that no one could have guessed. The moon is kept in its orbit by the same thing that makes an apple fall? Space and time are the same thing, and it's all curved? Light travels from A to B by taking <i>every possible path</i> from A to B and interfering with itself? These things, to someone who's thought about them enough to know what they mean, are <i>astonishing</i>.<p>> playing a lottery that they will discover something huge<p>I think you may have bought into the common misconception that all scientific progress is the result of occasional geniuses making huge leaps by the sheer power of their enormous brains. It doesn't really work that way. The advance of science is a collective endeavour; even if you never discover anything huge, you're contributing to it.<p>(And: why would someone become an artist, musician or author, essentially playing a lottery that they will create something wonderful even though such creations are extremely rare? Most books are unpublishably bad. Most published books are pretty weak. Even of the best published, most will probably be almost completely forgotten in ten years. -- And, again, there's nothing wrong with that: even a not-so-great artistic work enriches the world. And so it is with science.)",1291805461

The high dimensionality (or non dimensionality) of the space can definitely hurt performance of spatial trees such as R-Trees, however for distance trees what really kills you is the the metric to compute the distance. There can be a couple of problems with it: 1) if it takes a long time to compute that will obviously hurt you, 2) if the variance is low or if some distances are meaningless the tree will be mishapped.<p>I was thinking as I was going over the article again that you could represent you formulae as trees instead of strings. This might yield more accurate/interesting distances. I recently used the PQ-gram distance[1] to compare subsets of ASTs with great success. PQ-gram is a really fast approximation of tree edit distance. I also tried using exact edit distance with the Zhang-Shasha algorithm[2], but in general the PQ-gram was so much faster the greater accuracy of ZSS didn't matter.<p>[1] <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.149.7933"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.149....</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/timtadh/zhang-shasha"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/timtadh/zhang-shasha</a>",1291804354

But given that it is Tech crunch they are pretty much the best at grabbing leaks.<p>By the way, just to point out one thing, I'm not entirely sure either task, FB iterating into full on search and Google entering the social market is simpler than the other. But yes Google already has its very firm foothold in search. But then again you might not be considering that Bing could easily partner up with FB is the past trends are anything to go by. In which case Google should be doing there best to come up with something special.<p>And question. Why exactly would it be a poor product choice? I'm basing my thinking on the design of rockmelt, it has the share button and the friend edges which basically let you watch your twitter feeds and chat with fb friends from the browser. I hid the friend edges when demoing the software, wanted to save it for the final blow. I tell you I could have left with the share button and they would have thought it was a pretty neat idea.<p>That is obviously not a majority vote but it might be an indicator that the share button is cooler than we think. Although yes. With all the hype that was surrounding Google Me... This does feel like a kick in the head.",1291802625
