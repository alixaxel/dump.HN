1982748,comment,1982080,1982432,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"Practically, electromagnetism is straightforward. Imagine a straight wire with electrons flowing through it at constant rate. This way, the moving electrons produce a magnetic field that is always perpendicular to the electric current (which is along the wire). What is perpendicular to a line in three dimensions though? It looks something like this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electromagnetism.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electromagnetism.svg</a>. This phenomenon is governed by Ampère's law (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law</a>). A handy trick for figuring this out is using the right-hand rule: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule</a>.<p>Now, you can arrange your wire in any number of ways to produce a more interesting field. For example you can arrange it in a loop (or several loops). Since, once again the magnetic field is perpendicular to the wire, at the center of the loop it will be perpendicular to the plane of the loop. This way you can make an approximation of a constant field along an axis (just in that small space at the center of the loop/coil).<p>The fun part is that the inverse relationship also works: a changing magnetic field produces an electric field. Thus, taking a coil and moving a magnet inside of it sufficiently fast produces an electric field, which compels the electric charges in the coil to move producing an AC current. The change in the magnetic field is called the magnetic flux. This process is described by Faraday's law: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction#The_Maxwell-Faraday_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday%27s_law_of_induction#Th...</a><p>Lastly, Maxwell combined these two equations with two other fundamental equations of electrodynamics (namely, Gauss's law and Gauss's law for magnetism) with some minor corrections for some special cases: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations</a>. In physics laws and such are very often named not after the first person to discover something, but after the last. From these equations you can derive that light is nothing more than an electromagnetic wave (which of course then goes into the whole duality of light).",1291813105

I have an iPod Touch and an Android, and I struggle a lot with the iPod Touch. Even making the MP3 player (iTunes?) do what I want is a challenge, and that is a native Apple app. I also had a lot of problems with iPad apps when I tried the iPad of a friend. The lack of a back button is a problem if the browser pushes you into some other app (YouTube or Maps), for example.<p>I could go on and claim that Android usability is so much better than iPhone (which I personally feel it is). But lets just assume that this guy is used to the iPhone and hence can cope with it better than with Android.<p>Also, if his users struggle with his app on Android, it is probably his fault. What is stopping him from giving it the same interface as the iPhone version? iPhone has one button, Android has 4. So it should be possible to use the same interface on Android, assigning one button to behave like the iPhone button.<p>Btw, you don't actually have to use Eclipse for Android development. You can do everything with the command line, and hence integrate the development environment (simulator, build script) into any editing environment you want. I am not sure if the same is possible for XCode, but I don't think it is. If XCode does Java, you could probably even use XCode for Android development.",1291812807

Between both batteries, I have enough charge to last my from Barcelona to San Francisco with a 4 hour layover at JFK.  And, I have a full web experience, any files I need are perfectly synced without any hassle via Dropbox.  And, I can use most any desktop software I like.<p>3G service from most any carrier that I've tried is barely adequate for surfing the web on my Android cell phone. I would hate to have to rely on 3G service for all external storage for my computer.<p>I don't see how eliminating local storage on my computer and putting all my data on Google's servers is better than having access to that data locally.   Random access to an SSD is 10^(3-4) ns, a random seek on disks with spindles is 10^(6-7)ns and a packet sent round trip across the country is 10^(8-9)ns.<p>I can buy a 16GB flash drive at Frys for $15.  When local storage is so ubiquitous and cheap, I don't understand why would you want to develop an OS that relied on packet transfer for permanent storage rather than local storage with delayed synchronization.<p>It's not like having local permanent storage is much of a hindrance.  I've never said, ""Damn, if I could only get rid of 60GB of local storage on my computer, every thing would be great"".  I do find myself cursing my lack of network coverage on a regular basis, however.<p>I suppose that it makes sense if you are Google and you want as much of people's data on your servers so you can money by mining that data.

That calibre of software is completely overkill for anything but those purposes and it's sad that people use it instead of Pixlr and Inkscape out of laziness. Instead of finding the right solution for their purpose they steal the right tool for a million uses. Adobe doesn't charge $1000 because they want to screw people or push them to pirate, they charge that because it's Ferrari software for professional studios that charge $1000 an hour that use it as their primary tool.

I can't understand why someone would take a big upfront risk and do a traditional launch without testing the market first (and a POD soft launch is perfect for that).
