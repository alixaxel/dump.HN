2039741,comment,2039117,2039451,0,0,huhtenberg,,,"Chip cards cannot be ""replayed"" or cloned, that's why there's a chip in the first place. The chip stores card's private key that is used to digitally sign a (purchase) transaction. Each transaction  is a multi-message <i>exchange</i> in real-time between the terminal and the bank and it includes an unique ID generated by the bank, which is covered by the signature. This effectively prevents a replay.<p>The private key cannot be read from the chip without the use of a tunneling microscope or other hardware exotics. In fact it is not untypical for a chip to have a built-in protection against key retrieval that is set to physically fry the chip. The PIN is used to tell the chip to do the digital signing. No PIN = no signing.<p>That's how it works in general. This application of the smartcard technology is almost 20 years old, so while there are some variations one could still call it sufficiently <i>mature</i> :grin",1293325011

2039739,comment,2039498,2039498,0,0,lkrubner,,,"This article is a bit innocent. It does not examine how the big tax cuts of 1982 changed incentives for everyone. There is a considerable amount of research that suggests when income tax on top rates is high, workers prefer non-cash benefits, rather than money. Recall that in the USA, during the 40s and 50s, the top income rate was 91% on all income over $100,000 (roughly a $1 million in todays money). Because of this, most top stars did not seeks payment in excess of $100,000. Instead, they sought benefits in to go along with their $100,000. The big tax cuts of 1982 lowered top rates to 36%. This  made it much more rational for top workers to ask for high amounts.",1293324936

My guess would be that today being a deli manager just means that you need to follow your chain's rule books.
