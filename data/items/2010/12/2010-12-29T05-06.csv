Twitter's ""trademark"" is a keystone because it has allowed numerous companies develop through it's trademark such as tweetdeck and etc.  The term tweet has become a dictionary term at this point so their trademark is very valuable.  But, it's only valuable now because they've reached critical mass.<p>The irony is that if you don't trademark your name early, then someone else will steal it before you do.

2048029,comment,2047794,2047855,0,0,briansmith,,,"> Your conception of the speed of public-key crypto is warped by how slow SSL is; 256 bit elliptic curve crypto, which hasn't degraded in security for almost 25 years, is so fast that you can rekey 10 million sessions every 10 minutes on standard PC hardware.<p>This argument implies ECC and SSL are mutually exclusive when they aren't. ECC has been a standardized part of SSL for years and there are many shipping implementations. The same thing stopping ECC in SSL from being <i>deployed</i> is what would stop DJB's ECC-hard-coded protocol from being deployed.<p>I guess DJB still wants to use Curve25519, but nobody has taken any steps to make Curve25519 actually implementable by mainstream software vendors. The first necessary step is to get it approved by NIST. A second necessary step would be to get IANA identifiers reserved for its use in TLS and other protocols. The third necessary step would be for his claims about the un-patented-ness of the curves verified in a way that venders can rely on. A nice fourth step would be to have it endorsed by the NSA like the Suite B curves. IIRC, this would require some standards to slightly weaken their minimum requirements of 256-bit curves to allow this not-quite-256-bit curve.<p>> * That being the case, there's no excuse not to bake fast modern crypto into HTTP so that it's simply always there; Bernstein has created a TCP-friendly alternate transport protocol that does exactly this.<p>Lots of people are working on doing this using existing standards like DNSSEC, TLS, and (maybe) X.509 already. Minimal extensions of these existing standards are going to win unless they are shown to be unworkable or unless some other protocol is <i>soon</i> shown to be obviously overwhelmingly better.<p>> [B]ake public keys directly into URLs or hostnames (""nym-based security""), use CNAMEs and aliases to make things more user-friendly, and secure the end-user connections to the DNS.<p>I wonder how this would work in the real world when keys are rotated and/or revoked.",1293600715

What I've seen is two fold:<p>1- Greenwald calling out news organizations for presenting Assanges displeasure at his own privacy breaches as hypocrisy when it actually isn't hypocrisy for a democratic govt to have limited privacy and an individual to have maximum privacy.<p>2- Assange calling out the Swedish govt for leaking information about the case when the govts own laws dictate that the information remain private.<p>So although Wired eloquently said one thing, and you helpfully repeated it, is it even true? I haven't seen it, perhaps you could provide a link to Greenwald where he said it. And maybe there are a few more items on your cheerleading list that would be better served with some citations.",1293600359

2047997,comment,2047851,2047917,0,0,sp4rki,,,"I worked in not one but two call-centers during a very dark time of my life. I say freaking bomb all call-centers out of existence. They create crap jobs, with crap pay, and crap benefits that steal work from better qualified people.<p>In the first call-center I worked in, I was doing financial support for customers. I was great at my job because I was studying finance at that time in my life. Everyone else on the 200+ team (excluding this very smart girl that came from a crappy neighborhood with crappy parents) were complete and utter retards. The place was a petri dish of fraud, bad advice, and foul phone manners.<p>In the second call-center I worked in two departments. The first one was sales, basically 300 kids just out of school tricking customers into promotions they did not want and hanging up on clients when they couldn't get a credit card number. I was also great at sales because I developed a system, without bullshitting the customers. I always hit the bonuses... but the rest of the department also hit them, with 500% my performance. Imagine I sold 10 units per day to hit 60 units a week (the bonus being after 50 units sold), they sold 300. Fraud to the extreme (and I know this because a close friend of mine did this... his whole team did). Lastly I did tech support. I was probably one of the few (less than 10) people that actually understood the technology. The rest of the 120 strong department where tech illiterate.<p>Aside, I strongly remember one agent being fired because he brought two machetes into the office building and cut (superficially, no horror story here) some dude's arm, and a 45 year old lady agent that reported 13 cases of sexual assault (the lady was hideous looking and was just looking for an easy payday) which got the 13 men fired and which ended with her resignation which included a severance pay of several thousand dollars.<p>They funniest side, is that at least 60% of all the agents I met, could not speak or even comprehend decent english. I thought that might be a prerequisite to do customer support/sales for english speaking customers. In comparison, I was once reprimanded for speaking french to the french speaking husband of a customer about their tech equipment.<p>So yeah, I say bomb all these call-centers. I don't live in the US, but I think that those sales agent jobs dealing with people in the US should be filled with US sales agents. Those tech support jobs for US customers should be filled with US college kids or recent graduates. Instead companies pay 300~400 dollars a month to a bunch of retards (I can count myself in this group, though give me a break I had been kicked out of my house so I took the first job I was offered), cheats, and thieves, so they can go ahead and make your experience on the phone a living hell.",1293599640
