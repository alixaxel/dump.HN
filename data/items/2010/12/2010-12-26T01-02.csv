Filburn (1942) [1] that the US government can regulate the act of a farmer growing wheat to feed his own chickens on the grounds that had the farmer <i>not</i> grown that wheat, he would have then participated in the national wheat market that Congress could regulate, that his failure to purchase wheat on this market therefore affected the market by his absence, and thereby Congress can regulate his action in accordance with the Commerce Clause.<p>Again, I mention this without endorsement of either side; I mention this just because I only recently learned about this myself.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wickard_v._Filburn</a>",1293328779

2039836,comment,2039503,2039503,0,0,cletus,,,"I find posts like this one depressing. They're cynical and shortsighted.<p>The premise of such posts is that if people were aware of who was getting a tax cut they would be against it. Put another way: the premise is that everyone is purely motivated by self-interest.<p>There are two immediate problems with this line of thinking.<p>The first is tha it ignores how aspirational people are.i remember a survey from the 2000 election when Gore made the mistake of demonizing the top 1% repeatedly. The survey show something like 19% of people thought the were the top 1% and another 20% thought they would be someday.<p>The second problem is the whole ""money for rich people = bad"" argument. Some may ascribe to Reagenesque trickle down economics. Others may see that overtaxing the rich is ultimately shortsighted. Yet others may not get hung upon percentages and look at the absolute tax burden (iirc the top 1% pay ~40% of the tax burden).<p>Personally I just object to the tone of the rhetoric where politicians talk about ""affording"" or ""paying for"" a tax cut like they're giving away money. The reality is just that they're taking less money. Bit of a difference.<p>All of this is just ""policy theatre"" however. What the US (and most of the West for that matter) is facing a far bigger problem that the current systemis unsustainable and no politician wants to be at the helm when the music stop (to mix metaphors) with declining birth rates and increasing life expectancy.",1293328572

For example, if you gave a person a choice of two mutual funds, a low risk and a high risk, most people would put 50% in one and 50% in the other regardless of the actual distribution of risk over the two funds.<p>So if you gave the average person 5 groups of people and told them to ideally distribute the wealth between them, they would probably exhibit this same equality bias on average.<p>As for the estimated case, I'm sure you'd get similarly wrong responses asking the average person basic questions about U.S. history.

Let me give you some background on how I handle books, maybe it helps you with your work.
I read around 800-1000 pages a month, spend a lot of time searching for books to read next, and find it hard on amazon or anywhere else to get good suggestions. I have to collect and manage a queue myself so that I don't run out of material. 
I have two queues. One are actual physical books at home (shipped three at a time for free shipping, 3-6 books total).
The other queue are bookmarks in my browser(3-10). So I can think about the book for some time before a purchase.
The bookmarks either point to the amazon page, or wikipedia.<p>I would have some suggestions for your service so that it would benefit my habits.<p>- I like the /test layout with floating sizes better. It does look more like crawling through a box for the next great book.
However, I scrolled down maybe 6 pages and could have made 3 screenshots where the same book shows up twice at the screen. This is bad. I don't want to see a book twice at one screen or even after scrolling down for an hour. This would make me feel like I'm wasting my time because I already ruled out a book by not clicking on it.<p>- I want to bookmark a book-page, and the bookmark should stay alive. If I come back a month later, it should still work.<p>- On a single detail book page I would like to see the author as a link(not dead text), which should take me to a page like the start page with all titles of that author.<p>- You seem to have amazon and goodread for user review. I always go to wikipedia for the single book or the author. So I think you should have a link to wikipedia too, if there is one. For a book detail page it should be the wikipedia article for that book or the author. For an author summary page it should be the author wikipedia page, if one exists.<p>HTH",1293327049

At the least, you should make some attempt to explain why things change over time. Consider radio in the USA, up until the mid 1950s. It was eventually replaced by TV, but in the 30s, 40s and 50s it was the main medium of mass communication. The nation lived by its radio. The potential audience for a radio star was greater then than it is now. So why do top stars, like Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern earn such large fees now, when the market is so fragmented?<p>Changes in the tax code are important to consider. As a thought experiment, imagine if the top income tax rate was still 91%. (During the 30s, 40s, 50s and early 60s, it was 91% on income over $100,000, about a $1 million in today's money.) How many stars would ask for income in excess of $1 million if they knew it would be taxed at 91%?

Message passing as a paradigm is in my somewhat-experienced opinion really neutered when there's still only one thread of control.<p>The following won't produce a <i>perfect</i> Erlang design, but it's a start:<p>1. Create your traditional OO design.<p>2. Anything that isn't obviously a collection or glorified struct, instantiate as a process and write them as gen_servers (or relevant other OTP process instead).<p>3. Anything that is obviously a collection, use one of the language's collections instead; if you <i>really</i> need typing on those, layer it on top with a tuple. Anything that is obviously a glorified struct is a record with a central module representing the ""methods"" as functions on the record.<p>Like I said, this won't out-of-the-box produce a great design, but the mapping will actually get someone used to OO but not used to Erlang at least started understanding how it works in practice. You've got several million-ish processes to play with, and in most programs you will not need to exceed that; that is the idea behind the comments I made about ""collections"" and ""structs"", because while it's easy to have millions or yet more of bits of data you can write a lot of programs with even ""a few hundred"" serves floating around.<p>You get polymorpismish by passing PIDs around as objects and implementing interfaces, only this time it's literal server interfaces instead of syntactic sugar. You get encapsulation by the fact that processes simply can not peek in on each other; this is actually even more rigid than most OO languages, no friends, no public, no sharing. Inheritance is pretty manual. So, two of the three usual OO characteristics are there.<p>I find my designs end up in a way that I'm not comfortable calling strictly OO, but if you used OO terminology and an OO diagramming language to show, everybody would understand what you meant. Given the way inheritance has been getting downplayed in the OO community anyhow, well, I wouldn't call Erlang an OO language by any means but I use a lot more of the ""OO mental machinery"" when I'm programming in Erlang than I do when I'm programming in Haskell. It's not as foreign as you might think at first, there's a lot of crossover there. Arguably it's a better OO language than the languages that wrote inheritance into their syntax and runtime too hard, and arguably it's not, but it's an interesting argument.",1293325366
