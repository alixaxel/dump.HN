Would 1 million be enough to support the necessary technical infrastructure independent of the Earth?<p>If it isn't independent of the Earth then what's the urgency? Would having the same number of people on/in Earth, inside an independent ecosystem (""Biosphere III"", perhaps?) be sufficient safety net? That would be a lot cheaper.<p>The presumes that the author's stated goal of species survival is the only goal in advocating the colonization of other planets.<p>I believe there are gaps and omissions in the text.<p>""most recent 2 millennia living as farmers"" -- that should be about 6 millennia.<p>""there is no evidence that modern humans have ever gone extinct on a continent or a large island."" -- what, the Vikings on Greenland aren't modern enough while 1602 is?<p>""Detection of a large asteroid on a collision course with Earth would no doubt precipitate a frantic scramble to retrofit existing missiles to deliver a nuclear explosive to deflect it toward a less terrifying trajectory."" -- except I thought there were more effective ways than nuking it to another orbit.

A mass driver, or a gravity tow, or a number of other techniques seem more appropriate from what I've read.<p>""which each killed more than 200,000 people provide powerful reminders of the vulnerability of our species to natural disasters."" -- not at all. That's 0.003% of the species. If anything, it shows the vulnerability of an human but the resiliency of our species.<p>I can even argue that having more people, including those living in dangerous places, means more chances for survival. If we all uniformly lived away from Vesuvius, from tornado alley, from tsunami prone areas, and instead only lived in the safest, then we increase the chances that an unexpected event (asteroid, anyone?) at just the wrong spot can destroy everyone.<p>That's only hand-waving, which is what the author does all over the place.",1293245695

The flip side, though, is that there are far more cases to be heard at any given time than there are courts and personnel to hear them, and complex technical rules which have to be complied with. It seems very inefficient and arbitrary, but generally all of those rules were created in response to so some failing in the previous version. Every so often the 'legacy code' becomes unmanageable and a relevant part of the law is redrafted or similarly overhauled.<p>For example, California switched over to a completely new set of jury instructions known as CALCRIM for criminal trials a few years ago, designed to eliminate a lot of unnecessary confusion and legalistic cruft which had accrued to the previous version, known as CALJIC. But even drafting those from scratch takes years. My reference copy of CALCRIM is about 2500 pages over 3 volumes. And that's just criminal - there's a lot more for civil trials. A LOT more.<p>Think of it like encountering Unix as a complete newbie.

When you program in OO, you don't sit here thinking to yourself ""OK, I'm calling a method, wooo! OK, I'm calling another method! Wooo!""<p>Similarly, this is just the baseline stuff, the really interesting stuff comes out of what you build from that, which varies depending on the precise flavor of functional you are talking about. What's really interesting is what you build out of this stuff; you hardly ever sit there and go ""Wooo, I'm mapping! Wooo, I'm reducing! Wheeee!"" In fact you can write a lot of Haskell without ever writing the (local equivalent of the) word ""reduce"" or ""filter"" because you're always actually using something using that under the hood.
