2008526,comment,2007899,2007899,0,0,NelsonMinar,,,"This story is big news in the little world of general aviation. RunwayFinder was an excellent free product, well loved, and a lot of pilots are angry about it being bullied offline. RunwayFinder says they don't infringe. It seems likely to me, between the prior art, the obviousness of the patent, and the specificity of the patent claims (including language about using ""housekeeping frames""). But they lack the means to defend themselves.

2008520,comment,2007764,2008004,0,0,elblanco,,,"> Neither of these assumptions appear to be true, at least to me.<p>It's been my observation that if you ask most people who espouse a particular philosophy couched in ""morality"", that they claim that following their particular moral code will lead to well being. I've also found that the strong that belief is, the less likely that those followers have actually spent time thinking on the ramifications of their moral code towards that goal. They <i>think</i> they have thought about it a lot, but typically they've just spent brain cycles thinking about the <i>code</i> and how to follow it most closely -- not what following that code leads to.<p>I'm not disagreeing, just throwing in an observation -- most moral codes claim to lead to well being, but in reality many of them do not actually go there.<p>This phenomenon seems to create a particularly powerful barrier to rational thought that very few people seem to be able to overcome and can even seem to defeat some individuals.<p>I've seen friends, family and colleagues fail repeatedly to come to terms with this, they think it's because they haven't applied themselves completely to some arbitrary code so the only solution is to double down again and again.<p>After decades of doubling down this seems to drive people closer and closer to a kind of insanity...I've seen a few withdraw into fantasy worlds constructed of such powerful cognitive dissonance (arising from the inherent contradictions of their moral code and the observed outcome) that having a normal conversation about simple things, like the weather, become impossible -- they can barely complete a sentence without contradicting themselves or becoming lost and sidetracked about how such and such random topic has some particularly deep meaning in their hyper acute moralist world.",1292428664

2008518,comment,2007395,2007985,0,0,drndown2007,,,"I think you take it too far.  Yes, the powerful abusing the weak is not a healthy thing.  But there is actually 'bad' in the world that should be suppressed.  Unfortunately, there are people (you?) that are willing to say ""we can't all agree on what is bad, therefore nothing is bad"".  That would work, except for the fact that we're human, frail and don't know nearly as much as we think we do.<p>Since the original article is sex, and you refered to it above, let's continue with it.  Try going to an SA (sex addicts) meeting sometime and hear about shattered lives because of what someone did to someone else.  I'm going to put my foot down and say rape is bad because of the horrible emotional baggage it leaves in someone's life.  Incest is usually in the same category (I personally know a guy who will never have normal relationships because of what his older sister and friend did with him when he was 12).<p>I'm sure someone (you?) will try to argue there are cases where it's OK, so we shouldn't call rape 'bad'.  PLEASE!  Sometimes, there ARE things that should be suppressed.<p>And this doesn't mean anything or everything should be suppressed.  If people are suppressing/hiding something because they did wrong (the government) then it should be exposed.<p>Except, whoops, we just said the government did 'wrong'.  That's a value judgement!  <sarcasm>Maybe some people think starting fake wars is OK and we shouldn't be so quick to call that unsavory</sarcasm>  Value judgements have to be made as long as we're human.  Value judgements mean there is 'good' and 'bad'.  I don't think we want more 'bad' -- it's bad by definition!   If we ever get to the point that we're computers and can hit a reset button, then _maybe_ right and wrong will go away...<p>So wikileaks and exposing corruption -- good, bring it on, don't suppress it.  Encouraging rape or incest, I'm calling bad -- we don't need more of that in society.<p>(OK, bring on the down votes)",1292428652

2008514,comment,2006975,2006975,0,0,bmelton,,,"I have a friend of mine who moved away, so I now mostly keep in touch via his blog.  I've known him since 1995, and he's been HIV positive since I've known him.<p>That said, within the past few years he was admitted to a similar clinical trial that has all but eradicated the presence of HIV in his system.  For at least the past 6 months (it's under very close watch) there has been absolutely no detectable traces of HIV in his blood.<p>This is far outside my general sphere of knowledge, so I'm apt to speak unintelligently on the subject if I go into deeper detail, but it goes without saying that we're ecstatic for him, his family, and everybody else in the world plagued with the virus.<p>My biggest concern is the cost of the treatment.  He's in trial, so it costs him effectively nothing, but as the treatment is perfected and rolled out to the masses, I have very little doubt that this will be affordable to only those with the very best insurance or those with very fat pockets.<p>I'll reserve judgement on the morality of that, as I do believe the presence of an expensive cure is infinitely better than the absence of a cure, but I'm just hopeful that they can manage a way to ensure that it does in fact work as they believe, and refine the process to such a degree that it becomes affordable.",1292428538

That is why you still send an estimated payment that should cover your expected taxes.<p>Filing your corporate structure sends the paperwork to the state with your charter, the election form, EIN number, etc.  This is not the same as filing your taxes.  The 1120S return is separate from your personal returns, he's made a copy for you and your partner, the form is more difficult than a personal form, so, two copies + more work = $400.  The $200 for your personal tax return seems about right depending where you earn most of your income and depending on the quality of your recordkeeping.<p>As for your current situation, if you are unhappy now, it is unlikely you'll ever be happy with him again.  Find a new accountant.<p>If you paid $200 for personal tax + $400 for the corporations tax + $250 for the filing, I don't think those fees are too far out of line.<p>As for your recourse, talk to him, tell him you didn't understand the fee structure, you're faced with a penalty from the IRS, can he help?

But I did a whole bunch of backend ""cloud"" programming in 2006-2008, and I used Ruby for most of it. This included 90% of the backend for Flektor.com (now deceased -- but successful in that it was cool and we sold it to Fox) and all the backend stuff for Monkey Gods (monkeygods.com). At Flektor I actually started the backend in Lisp. At first ACL. Then they wanted thousands per server -- haha. Then we ported to CMUCL. But there were no libraries, and those we had were buggy. Even the MySql integration was buggy. The last thing you want is a flakey database library.<p>We switched to Ruby. Sure ActiveRecord was buggy too, but in a totally different way. The bugs didn't crash it, or put weird data into the tables -- they merely generated sloppy or incorrect queries (this was 2006). I could spot these and work around. And there were libraries for a LOT of stuff. Fixing bugs in the libraries was easy too.<p>Ruby also seems to have been designed as a practical language. There is a bit of distain in the Lisp world (or used to be) for I/O, as if it's dirty. Look at Scheme, it doesn't even have I/O in the spec (or didn't last time I looked).

To verify the string is balanced, you have (all b>=0) and 0=last b [read: minimum of b is 0, and last of b is 0]. They can be combined to one vectorizable expression:<p>(all b>=0) and 0=last b:sums (x='(')-x=')'<p>* The bugs in these languages tend to be almost exclusively logic bugs (wrong implementation assumptions, common to every language) or one-off bugs if your cut-and-paste vectors with mismatched indices.

The really interesting part comes when you ask, ""Is it designed to look like a recommendation from the site hosting the button or from PayPal itself?""<p>I'd say the intent is definitely the former in this case and the button was specifically to designed look like a recommendation from the button's environment as well as an endorsement from the company itself.

In the 80s and 90s, at least three different instantiations of VSL popped up and have been getting varying amounts of press ever since.<p>From John Barrow:<p>""[An] important lesson we learn from the way that pure numbers like α define the world is what it really means for worlds to be different. The pure number we call the fine structure constant and denote by α is a combination of the electron charge, e, the speed of light, c, and Planck's constant, h. At first we might be tempted to think that a world in which the speed of light was slower would be a different world. But this would be a mistake. If c, h, and e were all changed so that the values they have in metric (or any other) units were different when we looked them up in our tables of physical constants, but the value of α remained the same, this new world would be observationally indistinguishable from our world. The only thing that counts in the definition of worlds are the values of the dimensionless constants of Nature. If all masses were doubled in value [including the Planck mass mP] you cannot tell because all the pure numbers defined by the ratios of any pair of masses are unchanged.""<p>Quick plug:  Probably the most public proponent of VSL is João Magueijo who wrote a really interesting book on the process of challenging the scientific orthodoxy, called ""Faster Than the Speed of Light.""  It's an interesting (and often scathing) view of the process of academic science.",1292426670

Its essential to learn to read and understand common lisp code with little effort. In many cases, a lot of libraries have incomplete or outdated documentation, so the source code is the best documentation available.<p>- You'll have to learn to piece together a lot of incomplete information, scattered around in blogs, documentation, wikies, and source code.<p>- Prefer portable libraries rather than implementation specific extensions, if possible.<p>- Learn emacs.<p>- I would suggest also learning a bit about the history of lisp, a lot of weird things in lisp make a lot more sense if you consider the historical context in which many design decisions were made.<p>- Don't whine or complain, be a doer. My favorite quote from ""The bipolar lisp programmer"" is at the end: ""Lisp is, like life, what you make of it."" You have to take matters into your own hands in order for things to get better. Even though I've only been using common lisp for a few months, i like to think of myself as personally responsible for the state of the Lisp ecosystem, because im not writing libraries or documentation, nobody is going to do this stuff for you. There simply aren't enough of us.<p>- Avoid the ""Smug lisp weenie"" mentality, its not helping. Sure, lisp is better than java(by some criteria), but feeling smug about this isn't helping at all. It only drives people away.<p>Im currently compiling a larger list of such tips and opinions. I hope to be able to publish it soon, so more experienced lispers can help me with it.",1292426603

He has some book out about how to become superman, lose gads of weight, put on super muscle mass, all while picking your nose and watching Oprah. Or something very similar to that. (For all I know the man is a miracle worker. His pitch seems a bit over the top, though)<p>When I click over to Amazon, one of his books has 1062 reviews, all positive! http://bit.ly/fVCXNM<p>Geesh! Look -- I've been poking around Amazon, both as a new affiliate (the above link is an affiliate link) and as a customer. I like reading reviews for stuff I buy before I buy it. Both the good and bad reviews help me make an informed choice.<p>But something is really wrong here. As several reviewers noted on his most recent book, the number of positive reviews is just crazy. Books with tremendously great reputations don't have anywhere near the reviews as some of these books do.<p>There may be an innocent reason for this. Perhaps just a big fan club? Or more darkly, perhaps folks are starting to game the review systems. This isn't the first time I've suspected something is seriously wrong with the review systems on ecommerce sites. It's like a hidden form of spamming where you never realize you're being spammed. Hopefully some aspiring startup can help fix it. Maybe some kind of weighed meta review site? Because as more hacking takes place, more and more this pattern of selection isn't going to work at all for the consumer.",1292425759
