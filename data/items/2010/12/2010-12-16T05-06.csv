2011258,comment,2009666,2009666,0,0,nl,,,"I'm currently find this discussion ignorant and annoying.<p>People are claiming a $3.7 B valuation implies a $10 B exit, and that this is absurd somehow, so therefor the VC's must be stupid.<p>Here's the Math so you can understand the logic.<p>Google claim they can make $10/year from advertising, per user on Android phones[1].  Current speculation is that Facebook is on course to make around $1.6 B from 500 million users this year (ie, $3.2/user/year)[2]. If Google and Facebook can do this, than surely Twitter can make a comparable number - but lets say $2/user/year to be conservative. Twitter has ~150/million users, so they should be able to make around $300M/year. Google's P/E is ~20, but they are a mature company, and Facebook seems to be trading at a P/E of ~50. For out estimates we'll split the difference and give Twitter a P/E of 30. 300M * 30 = $9 Billion.<p>People seem to think that Twitter can't make any money from advertising. In my view, this is a pretty extraordinary claim - everyone else can make money, so why can't Twitter? They actually have a lot of advantages (eg, desktop & mobile installs) that most websites don't have. Many companies <i>pay</i> to be included on toolbars etc that end up on people computers, and yet to here people here talk you'd think having millions of people install your thick client is a disadvantage!<p>[1]<a href=""http://blogs.computerworld.com/17099/google_says_android_already_breaks_even_will_be_a_10_billion_business"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.computerworld.com/17099/google_says_android_alr...</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2010/09/facebook-revenue-estimates-continue-to-rise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marketingpilgrim.com/2010/09/facebook-revenue-est...</a>",1292479115

2011242,comment,2010208,2011103,0,0,evgen,,,"When you talk about ""subsidies"" for abstract ""resources"" and then try to decouple them from the available market in these resources (through such terms as ""other things being equal"") you are engaging in a bit of sophistry.  Yes, resource usage may be greater per capita in the suburbs, but the most expensive resource in most cases is space/land and it is very, very expensive in urban cores.  Urban space is so expensive that it often washes out the more efficient usage of other resources that density can offer.<p>You can claim that in a city people will have mass transit available, but with only a few exceptions in the US that mass transit is underutilized and really only serves to get a small fraction of the urban residents to work and back; it does not serve other daily needs quite as well, so after taking mass transit back from work you will hop into your car to go get groceries or go out for some entertainment in the evening.<p>If these magical subsidies truly existed at the level you are suggesting they would be both obvious and a source of growing political friction given the re-urbanization of the American population.  Could you point out some examples of these subsidies? [And before you start, ""fuel"" does not really count since it cuts both ways in this argument and urban residents to not lead significantly more fuel efficient lives than their suburban counterparts.]",1292478615

If someone had leaked the truth prior to the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, then over 100K people would be alive today who were killed, some of whom are American soldiers.<p>I'd argue that the wars and inappropriate secrecy have done incalculable harm to American national security by creating for us many new enemies, people who had probably admired the US until one of their friends or relatives was injured, killed, taken captive, interrogated harshly and inhumanely, etc.<p>The Apache helicopter video showed a couple of scared-shitless youth raging against anyone in their sights.  One can't help but feel sorry for them, and no sensible person blames them for the carnage.  But is that really what America is supposed to stand for?<p>The Afghan war logs show a nation that has supported a war largely due to vital information about conditions being kept from the American people.  Are we really supposed to be proud of a war that we only support b/c information is classified whenever it might make the war effort look somewhat futile or mismanaged?<p>Both the Iraq and Afghan war logs show us how weak the US really is and how under-leveraged.  We're negotiating with terrorists, thugs, and criminals left and right.  It's far uglier than any realist would have dared imagine b/c of the lofty regard in which we hold our leaders.<p>I am not persuaded by your argument that Manning poses a risk of additional secrets being revealed.  The very nature of his alleged actions (he smuggled out a CD-Roms full of information, less than 1% of which has been leaked via Wikileaks so far) suggest that he'd be able to recite any classified information at all.  Unless you tell me he has a flash drive implanted in his finger or an amazing photographic memory I'm going to have to say that your argument doesn't hold water.<p>They're probably trying to make an example of him or break down his psychological stability.  I suppose that's to be expected, but it puts our actions on par with the basest of regimes... at some point the legitimacy of a state comes from how it treats its citizens, guilty <i>or</i> innocent.",1292478571

When the brightness off the mirror spikes, rotate one disk to reduce the amount of light transmitted.

On the face of it, this sounds like a great opportunity for some investors to make a lot of money. Buy some land in SF, rebuild with taller, better-constructed buildings, and then collect the increased rent money.

There's things where relational databases are a good fit, and things that are a bad fit. As such, this isn't about what PostgreSQL does poorly, but about the cases where a key-value store with some pretty good data structures comes in handy. Would you really store temporary data in your relational database? Would you use it as a caching mechanism? Perhaps as a queue? Not unless you're crazy. So I guess this isn't about what PostgreSQL performs poorly, but about where Redis is a better solution.",1292476603

There is only one way to be sufficiently certain that he does not cause further damage, and that is to keep him in isolation.  If it is justifiable to keep an extremely violent criminal in isolation to prevent possible future harm to others, is it not equally justifiable to keep a nonviolent criminal in isolation in order to prevent possible future harm to even greater numbers of people?<p>EDIT:
Downvote if you like, but the question remains a valid philosophical question: if it is ethical to keep a person in isolation to preempt the possibility of physical harm to others, does the mechanism by which the harm is perpetrated matter?",1292475991

This doesn't seem like the way things should work. We shouldn't be spending time thinking up clever and logical explanations of what hoops Apple puts the very developers that make its platform interesting through.<p>Am I wrong? I don't (yet) write iPhone apps, and I am honestly seeking sane opinions of those who do.<p>As a student, I am currently learning everything I can about everything that goes on my computer and how it works, and realizing that almost <i>nothing</i> I currently know would be possible without all the open-source tools that are used in every one of our courses (none of the lab machines in the CS department here run Windows). The very core idea of being able to tinker and learn about each moving part of software, like a mechanism made of semi-transparent gears, is what attracted me personally into the industry in the first place. Developers' ideas seem to only be guided by what they are able to dream up and code, and anyone can participate and improve things collaboratively creating something beautiful and useful.<p>And now I'm learning that one of the supposedly more exciting ways to make a living using the acquired knowledge is to do things in very particular restricted ways, according to the rules set out by one company, using the tools they deemed fit. Perhaps I'm overdramatizing, but there is just something very fishy about the entire concept, and I can't tell whether my confusion stems from lack of knowledge, the fact that I'm looking at it from a fresh point of view that others are just too deep in the trenches to see, or both.",1292475750

Automobile-based transportation is heavily subsidized both through direct taxation paying for automobile-optimized roads as well as minimum parking requirements that essentially proscribe building anything resembling a walkable neighborhood in many cities. And those requirements mean that anyone who doesn't drive to a business is forced to share in the cost of providing parking for a business (which can be tens of thousands of dollars a parking space).
