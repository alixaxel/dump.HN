Even children do this.  (Well, Zuckerberg might not find personas, roles, and code-switching intuitive, but I think super focused computer types are not representative... ;) )  There is scholarly work to back me up, but I can't think of any names to start with except Labov and Goffman -- they are completely brilliant mind f<i></i>s if you bother to read them.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Eve...</a><p>Re the UI -- spot on, but maybe that is a UI problem, not a UI boundary condition, and we could start researching cues for persona switching on the computer screen.

Get shit done to make yourself happy.<p>When reading a few responses here, I'm taken back with the comment ""It's easy for you to preach, you don't have kids"". In real life, I heard similar sentiments.<p>I'm having a hard time trying to understand the feeling when people said such things. Having kids is a choice, no? The same thing with living über-minimalistic life. People who don't have kids may have serious problems too.<p>Me and my wife, we don't have kids. But what we do have in terms of problems:<p>1. Selfish, arrogant, and wasteful parents. We helped them a lot and never received a single thanks. They love to have elaborate parties even though they are broke.<p>2. A 14 years old sister. Amazingly selfish little brat, complete disconnect between what she wants and what our parents could provide. Fucking android for 14 years old, what for? I cannot imagine her coding up some android app.<p>I don't have a million dollar and far from it. When I was 26, I swallowed the ""American Dream"" Kool-aid bottoms up and really needed that 1 million dollar:<p>We bought a big house, with .25 acre land. We owned 3 cars. I did all the stupid things that can only happen if you own a house: upgrading HVAC, kitchen, etc. etc.<p>Only 1 thing I did that wasn't stupid: paying for wife's school.<p>Now, we don't own TV, 1 car, 1 couch, < 700 sqft apartment, 2 cats, and 0-10 minutes commute.<p>When we went through the transformation, crazy things happen. My sisters respect me a lot more. When they want superfluous things and I said no, they listen far more than they ever did. Crazy things happen with the parents too. They listened, twice, when I told them about the elaborate parties.<p>Not needing money empowered me far more than money ever did. And I'm quite sure that I'm not unique in that regard.\nMy future kids won't have lawn to run around or the latest apple gadgets to pimp around. Their life won't be govern by money. This plan may or may not work, my real life friends would be the judge of that.<p>To drive my points further, unrelated to my life story, several tech co-founders have told me directly. ""The best time to raise money, is when you don't need money"".<p>Extra brownie point: To buy freedom into United States (the easy way), you really need a million dollar. <a href=""http://bit.ly/9RItQM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/9RItQM</a>",1292907051

The short one only shows up in the google search link.<p>The point is, imagine you're trying to get to the Airbnb website, and you're the type of user who is going to type ""airbnb"" (or the closest thing you can remember to that) into google.  When google returns the Airbnb url, the optimal thing for them to display is ""Airbnb"".

We have a political system that structurally has an unusually large number of veto points (compared to similar western nations). The result is that change is slow and the system is resistant to external forces. In addition, we have a system that systematically overrepresents the interests of rural counties.<p>There is a relatively ""easy"" way to fix the second problem: states with large populations should start splitting into multiple states. But due to status quo bias such ""simple"" changes are unlikely to ever happen. Fixing the veto points problem is harder still: it is wired into the fabric of American governance.",1292906641

Because it's artificially low - so the argument goes - that's what explains (at least in part) the current levels of competition.<p>Infrastructure players claim that once regulatory certainty is provided (against net neutrality) - then, since the pot of profits for infrastructure providers will increase - this will in turn encourage more entrants to the market.<p>Actually - one way you might argue against their economic argument is say: okay, but if the profit pot is only being increased because infrastructure players are bundling content, then infrastructure players that want to give users completely free reign to surf where they want will be priced out of the market.  Bundlers will be able to subsidise network access at a lower price because of income generated through the content.  Non-bundlers won't be able to do this and will quickly go out of business...  Since big media content is already tightly controlled by a few large corporations, only a few infrastructure players will be able to provide such subsidies.

I have long given up any hope of finding them later, though - all but the most important diagrams are destined for the recycling bin from the get-go. That's an approach I picked up from the 37signals blog or one of their presentations somewhere, and I highly recommend it.

The U.S. economy has suffered a severe and historic financial fall. To recover from that it's theoretically more favorable to provide citizens with tax cuts than not. Add to that the hand Obama was dealt at the mid-term elections which tilted the scales of congress in the Republican favor, and you see much more pressure to compromise in order to <i>govern for progress</i> of the country rather than draw lines in the sand for gridlock.<p>I'm not saying Obama is Jesus in the flesh, and that he never gets anything wrong.

I feel this is a major weakness in the way Facebook is structured and any competitor should look to exploit this fundamental flaw.<p>If I were building a competitor to Facebook (like Google may be), I would allow a person to create sub-profiles under a main login.  For example, a user could have the sub-profiles for themselves: ""Work"", ""Family"", ""Friends"".  Each sub-profile would have it's own profile picture, it's own contact info, it's own newsfeed.  When someone wants to add you, you would have the choice of which sub-profile you want to give them access to.<p>The main message that such a social network would need to give users is that each sub-profile is strictly walled off from your other profiles.
