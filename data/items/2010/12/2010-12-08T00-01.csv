Lanyrd lets you list the speakers for a conference, e.g. ""@timbray is speaking at AndroidCon"" - without those people necessarily having signed up for accounts on the site. Since speakers often have large Twitter followings, this makes it much more likely that a user signing in for the first time will get at least a few conference suggestions.<p>This complicates things a bit when we start involving other identity providers, since we then have to start tracking equivalent accounts on multiple services (Tim Bray on LinkedIn = TimBray on Facebook = @timbray on Twitter).

1981362,comment,1980132,1980769,0,0,mikemike,,,"Alias analysis is a good example. A JIT compiler may speculatively add dynamic disambiguation guards (p1 != p2 ==> p1[i] cannot alias p2[i]). If the assumption turns out to be wrong, the JIT compiler dynamically attaches a side branch to the guard using the new assumption (p1 == p2 ==> p1[i] == p2[i], which is an even more powerful result).<p>Doing this in a static compiler is hard, because it would have to compile both paths for every such disambiguation possibility. This quickly leads to a code explosion. You'd need very, very smart static PGO to cover this case: there are no branch probabilities to measure, since the compiler doesn't know that inserting such a branch might be beneficial. It may only derive this by running PGO on code which has these branches, which leads to the code explosion again.<p>Auto-vectorization is another example: a static compiler may have to cover all possible alignments for N input vectors and M output vectors. This can get very expensive, so most static compilers simply don't do it and generate slower, generic code. A JIT compiler can specialize to the runtime alignment and even compile secondary branches in case the alignment changes later on (e.g. a filter fed with different kernel lengths at runtime).",1291769542

The only way I found, was to long-click on the xcode dock icon which after a while splatters small versions of the windows everywhere, then scan these tiled windows until I find the right one and click on it. I have to do that atrociously long multi-step process every damn time I wan't to take a glance at another window! This, for example, makes the internal iOS documentation useless to me. At least I can use the web documentation to get the browser dock icon but when I don't have an internet connection I'm out of luck.<p>While I'm at it, is there any way, when using 'Spaces' to do a desktop change in one click? I'm mainly a Linux user and I'm used to having multiple desktops. OSX also has this functionality, and the 'Spaces' icon actually has four little square on it that represents the four desktops it's controlling. However when I click on one of the small squares, instead of going to the right desktop like it does in Gnome/Linux (and has been doing right since about 1995), it goes into an animation where the four desktop are displayed tiled full screen and I have to pick one. That is a two step process with an animation in between for something that should clearly be instantaneous. Is there an alternative to this.

I have figured out how to get us well (we actually work together on it but I do most of the research).  Reading up on altitude sickness was an Aha! moment for me.  In some ways, medical science doesn't have much of value to offer me in terms of thinking through the problem and coming up with new solutions.  Medical science is mostly about finding better drugs rather than a better understanding of the process involved in what is typically a slow torturous death where your lungs deteriorate until you qualify for a lung transplant (assuming you don't have bad habits that disqualify you).<p>Reading this piece was personally meaningful to me in surprising ways that I probably can't adequately express.   I belong to entire communities operating in their own medical equivalent of ""The Dead Zone"", where lack of oxygen, high doses of medication and so on create very emotional, inflammatory discussions and many people seem incapable of thinking logically.  I wrestle continuously with both how and whether to offer assistance in the face of enormous hostility and long odds that it will really do any good.  Even people who are interested in what I am doing sometimes write me and bluntly state up front ""I will <i>never</i> make the extreme lifestyle changes you have made.  But can you tell me more about ... (some food or supplement)?""<p>Stories about mountain climbing, altitude sickness et al are the absolute best analogies I have tripped across for what I am dealing with.  I don't care if mountain climbers are crazy or selfish or whatever. I am grateful for the information they provide. I have a medical condition that forces most people with it to basically gradually suffocate.  So I find value in the stories and experiences of mountain climbers.  Also, living at 3000 feet above sea level for about 2.5 years, thereby forcibly expanding my lung capacity, probably helped save my life when I spent a year at death's door and was bedridden for 3.5 months and finally got a diagnosis after a lifetime of being treated like a hypochondriac.<p>Some people are facing things like this totally involuntarily and their situations are difficult to talk about in normal company because it is viewed pathetically rather than like a heroic struggle.  I don't need any pity-parties.  I am perfectly capable of wallowing in self-pity without any assistance.  I need some kind of healthier, more useful feedback.

A top-notch engineer just out of college costs about $120k/year when you factor in insurance and other expenses (this number will likely go up even more). A senior engineer can easily cost $150k - $180k/year. That's not counting recruiting costs, which are about a third of first year's salary (You can find recruiters that will work for 15-25% but they won't get you any good engineers). Between a team of five, and other expenses, a startup that raises $500k is incredibly underfunded.

I think you may be misunderstanding how the vmm works.  When you allocate memory by calling mmap(), sbrk() etc., that amount of memory is committed whether or not you actually use it. Because many processes will allocate more than what they actually use, for example excess stack space, the vmm allows you to overcommit by a certain percentage, defaulting to 50%. This will allow processes to allocate 50% more memory than the system actually has. If that is exceeded, however, Linux has an Out Of Memory Killer which will start killing processes.",1291767676

The price range you're aiming for doesn't sound unreasonable if you're aiming for the smaller businesses; any more and you start getting compared unfavourably with services like Basecamp that can keep people updated to what others are doing plus several other useful tasks. I agree that charges loosely based on number of users (up to 10; up to 50; up to 200; make up the price as you go along if you're lucky enough to get serious enquiries for larger companies and consider a free 3 user plan as proof of concept) make more sense than by project.<p>I'm not your target market, and probably wouldn't use it, but I like the execution of the product, particularly details like Github commit based updates.
