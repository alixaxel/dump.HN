I truly hope Amazon is making ungodly sums of money with this increasingly powerful platform. Why Google is laser-focused on social and local, yet letting Amazon eat their lunch in this space is beyond me. I know Google has AppEngine and Storage, but they seem to be lacking the full-featured, cohesive collection of cloud services that Amazon has so clearly invested themselves in. I truly wonder if we will wake up five years from now and the vast majority of the web will be running on Amazon infrastructure.",1291960539

There are things we all consider ""fine art"" - classical music, opera, paintings, etc. The common theme seems to be that they don't offer instant gratification and are designed cleverly. My question is whether anyone can use reason to say it is objectively better than other forms of art, like a Britney Spears song, etc. Alternatively, if there is no way to to prove something like art is ""better"", I would be interested in knowing evidence that studying a ""fine"" art is better for your development as a successful human being than other art.<p>I've found an advantage in my exposure to the arts through being able to relate to educated people better, and also learning very educational things like the theory behind music, but I imagine I could have learned that from the professionals behind pop music as well.",1291958039
