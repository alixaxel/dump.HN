This creates a direct incentive for them to learn the language and actually integrate into the new society.<p>The great problem Europe has with migrants is not the inherent ""poor imported stock"", but the lean welfare rules and strict employment rules. This ensures a toxic proportion of new arrivals simply don't want to or can't integrate. It also means you get second-generation immigrants with no better prospects than their parents.",1291967804

Python 2.6, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Scala, Java and D all believed that 010 == 8, while GHC, GNU Prolog, GNU Smalltalk, Scheme (Guile and Racket) and Common Lisp all treated it as being equal to 10. Python 3 actively rejects it, because they've changed the octal literal syntax to 0o10 to prevent this from sneaking up on people.<p>Some of the other complaints are valid—for example, I dream of a sensible module system when writing in C, which would alleviate #13—but a lot of the complaints are sort of petty, and I'd argue that this one, being true of many more languages than C, falls directly into the petty bin.",1291967557

I read (and studied and reread) an Isaac Asimov book on basic physics (""Understanding Physics"") in junior high, so is it any wonder physics came ""effortlessly"" to me in high school?  I started learning high school chemistry from a ""Chemistry the Easy Way"" study guide a year and a half before I took the class; is it any wonder I got As despite being a lazy student who never paid attention in class?<p>Of course, part of the draw of learning physics and chemistry was that I was acting out a role I enjoyed, that of the ""smart kid.""

Limiting it to single, uncorrelated map-reduce (or even just reduce) steps seems like it would remove a lot of potential for abuse.<p>But who knows---if service providers tend to take in and operate on more data than clients (especially from multiple clients), it seems there is a fundamental information imbalance, and obfuscating techniques by clients can't possibly do as well as deanonymizing techniques by the provider in the long run.<p>I wonder if it is the case that fully homomorphic encryption might _increase_ the potential for such information leakage relative to a partial homomorphic encryption; the more algebraic structures for which an encryption function is a homomorphism the more vulnerable it is. If a fully homomorphic encryption captures the +, * operations of a ring, you can exploit two identity elements, one for * and one for +. The next step in 'badness' would then be something like R-modules, where in addition to the ring you have another group (and another operation and identity element).",1291966165

The headline is a link to the Posterous page, not the source (unlike Daring Fireball “linked list” items, for example).  How many people will actually follow the link?  Why is this Posterous blog entry #1 on HN when a permalink to the original source on Quora is readily available?<p>Let’s be clear.  This is not “fair use.”  It’s not <i>plagiarism,</i> as Garry doesn’t claim he wrote the anecdote; but it’s a violation of copyright.

It got quite a few reads — but a lot of people were re-tweeting a link to a full copy of it hosted on <i>someone else’s Posterous.</i>  That user didn’t add much (A sentence expressing “me, too”).  I was conflicted: Glad people found my writing interesting enough to duplicate and share, but disappointed that they were reading it on someone else’s site for no good reason.<p>I see now that if the company’s own bloggers consider copyright a joke, if they believe posting other people’s articles verbatim is kosher, well, can we be surprised their users do, too?<p>(Postscript: This differs from Tumblr’s “re-blogging” in one important way: You only re-blog other Tumblr posts. “Re-blogging” is part of the Tumblr system. You expect it there if you post there. You don’t “lose” anything by it. I have no problem there.)<p>† I don’t know if Quora’s terms of service mean that consent is implied, but honestly, in this case and this case only (the case of a Posterous employee), it doesn’t matter, because it’s about setting precedent for the community.",1291964973
