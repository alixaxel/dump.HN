Even if tooth decay happened to no longer be a service dentists needed to provide, the market would adjust the pay and number of dentists accordingly to match the new market.<p>This might suck for dentists over near future, but people would be much better having to no longer worry about tooth decay. Besides, gum disease is a probably a much bigger issue for people's dental health anyway, and that would be just as big a problem after this technology was released.",1291633122

If so, did you tell the seller upfront exactly how much you wanted it, and exactly how much you could pay? How about selling a house--do you put it up at the absolute minimum price you'll accept and tell that to buyers, providing access to your financial records to prove that you can't go lower? When applying for a job, do you tell the employer up front the lowest pay you will accept?<p>In most negotiations, if you can't keep your position secret you will get screwed.<p>The same goes for governments.<p>As far as children go, teaching that honesty is good does not mean teaching that secrets are bad.

1974769,story,,,72,21,tav,"HN Petiton: Get Google to support SSL on all of its APIs",,"As a security-conscious developer, I have started switching over my apps to be served over only SSL. Whilst this might end up being a costly exercise (e.g. having to proxy images in user generated content), the added privacy and security for my users is justification enough for me.<p>Unfortunately the biggest pain in migrating to SSL are the external API providers — very few of them support or even encourage the use of SSL. And, surprisingly, Google is one of the biggest culprits. I say surprisingly as Google have been very vocal on the use of SSL and have done the most significant real work in reducing the technical overheads of using SSL, e.g. see the awesome work by Adam Langley, an extra-ordinary Googler: http://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html<p>I've had to resort to various hacks in order to support various Google services, e.g.<p>* Using server-side API calls instead of cheaper client-side ones.<p>* Using a custom Flash video player and proxying YouTube videos.<p>* Proxying all custom domain requests to a Google App Engine app!!<p>* Using alternative domains, e.g. https://www.google.com instead of http://chart.apis.google.com<p>I am not happy with any of these hacks, but see no other way around the problem. The rare feature requests on the various Google Groups are often followed by either deadly silence or ""not supported"" responses from Google.<p>e.g. http://groups.google.com/group/google-chart-api/browse_thread/thread/95c463d88cf3cfe4<p>And if you ever want to use Google Maps over HTTPS, then Google would like you to get a Google Maps Premier account which <i>starts</i> at $10,000!! Since when did fundamental security become a premium feature? This seems to be a common trend being adopted by other service providers too, and I'd really like to ask them to rethink SSL as a premium offering. It should be a fundamental feature. Please.<p>In contrast to Google Maps, Bing Maps from Microsoft does offer an SSL variant:<p>* https://ecn.dev.virtualearth.net/mapcontrol/mapcontrol.ashx?v=7.0&s=1<p>And, although their API is decent enough, I struggled with switching as the current Bing Map tiles are rather washed out and suffer from usability issues.<p>In the end, I ended up coming up with a hack for using Google Maps by loading it on a vanilla HTTP domain opened via `window.open` from an HTTPS domain and using `window.postMessage` to communicate between the two windows. This unfortunately won't work in older browsers like IE6, IE7 and Safari 3.x, but works in enough other browsers (IE8+, Firefox 3+, Safari 4+, Chrome) to just about be workable.<p>I really really really would rather not have to come up with all these workarounds and fragile hacks. And I can't imagine that I am the only developer having to experience this masochism.<p>In an ideal world, there would be a concerted effort to get <i>all</i> service providers to start offering HTTPS APIs, but Google seem like a good starting point. They've already got great technical support for SSL on their Front End (GFE). And, as can be seen by Google Maps Premier, they already have support for SSL in many apps, and it's clearly a business decision holding back uptake:<p>e.g. http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/issues/detail?id=591<p>And since a substantial number of Googlers read HN, I figured if we could get enough support here, then there might be some very real chance of change from Google. So, if you, like me, would like to see all Google APIs offered over SSL, then please upvote this article. And if you happen to know Googlers, then please ask them to try and do something about this issue if they can.<p>Thanks!",1291632273

Reading code and packing it into your brain is the hardest part of programming, so having it all written in your own familiar style makes it really easy to get back up to speed on any bit of the project, even if you haven't visited it in a while.<p>Having even one other developer in there making changes can throw you out of speed-reading mode and make you stop and figure out what the other guy was thinking.  That slows you down, and slowing down opens the door to distraction, which leads to bad things.<p>It gets really good when you're working by yourself on a project for which you're providing the direction.

1974761,comment,1974433,1974433,0,0,pierrefar,,,"Well, there is more to plaque and thus caries than just one enzyme no matter how much it gets hyped up. I've done quite a bit of research on this and the short answer is that it is a complex interaction between many different bacteria (a large percentage of which we cannot grow in the lab) and the human host. Yes different genetics seem to be make people more or less resistant to caries and different habits play a key role. Also we know of some bacterial genes that when knocked out result in less or no plaque in the lab, but again, it's only one type of bacterium. In the mouth, if you somehow managed to (legally, ethically, and technically) introduce such mutant bacteria, it is likely that another one will produce the plaque and you're off again. It is just not easy to fix.<p>So trying to spin that this one enzyme from only one type of bacteria found in plaque is responsible for caries and that it is the nail that holds this complex in place is a bit premature and silly.",1291631856

A brilliantly apt form for a novel about science, which makes it hard to describe without spoiling it.<p>The author has his usual fun.  Historical inspriation: monasteries in the dark ages.  Martial artists: far too cool for their own good.  Tensor calculations performed as interpretive dance: it had to be done.  The plight of hackers and scientists in a violent, greedy world strikes as true as ever.<p>Stephenson's neologisms are a bonus.  The principle ""'X would be nice' does not imply X"" needs a name, though I don't expect ""Diax's rake"" to stick.
