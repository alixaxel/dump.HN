You mean that you find it hard to find 'single word' or 'perfect descriptions' of common ideas, and that's true, but I'm fairly sure that you can find plenty of good domain names for exactly $8.<p>The value of a domain is directly proportional to the amount of time that you put in to it.

I couldn't put it down.<p>It's easy to read for 2 reasons: every chapter is a short essay by a different person (including many Techstars alumni) and it's very well written, almost like pg essays but by lots of different people. It covers lots of ground, much of which has been covered here at hn many times, but then again, some of this stuff can't be covered too often. Also, sometimes someone says the same thing a little differently, and that's the one that actually reaches you.<p>My 300 page copy has 50 or 60 dog-earred pages and hundreds of red marks; it's that full of gems. (For that reason, I highly suggest buying a hard copy and keeping it on your bookshelf for future reference.)<p>I think that yc should come out with a similar book. I'd love to read essays from yc alumni, their advisors, and of course the yc principals themselves about what they thought was important.
