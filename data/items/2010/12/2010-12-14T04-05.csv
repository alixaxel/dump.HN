In addition, those addresses may be needed for operational purposes - such as notifying some Customers of a breach or recalls on products.  Emailing someone for either of these scenarios are not viewed as ""Spam"" by CAN-SPAM.  in addition, you need a record of opt-outs to be CAN-SPAM compliant...using this technique actually makes you non-compliant.<p>In the end, the best thing to do is use a proper email provider or marketing automation vendor that can properly allow you to setup emailing preferences and opt-outs (and can enforce adding unsubscribe links, etc to ALL your emails).  These systems store the date/time and IP address of the computer that opted out for compliance reasons.  Finally - these systems generally will aggressively SUPPRESS from sending to unsubscribed users (even so far as preventing sending the same email twice accidentally) by marketing users accidentally.<p>While the stored email opt-outs can be used if hacked into - I would assume this would be just as bad as getting the rest of your list....in the end this is kind of security through obfuscation.

In some data stores primary keys are always clustered (innodb), in some they're not (myisam), and some even let you optionally cluster the table data on a non-primary index (sql server).<p>> Contrast that with a secondary index, where each leaf node essentially contains the physical address of the record, so for each record you're returning, you have to make an additional random seek to the underlying datastore to get the entire record.<p>Not necessarily: often the non-leaf nodes of the clustered index are stored somewhere completely separate from the leaf nodes and end up with the address of a leaf node page. In such case <i>seeks</i> may not any better in principle but <i>scans</i> on the clustered key where you need lots of non-key data from the data page are. If you <i>do not</i> need lots of non-key columns from the data page, scans on the clustered key can actually be slower because the key columns are stored so much further apart and not all next to each other.<p>On the other hand, the secondary index may not end with row addresses but instead with primary keys which then must be looked up in turn, so in such case logically cannot be any faster than a primary key for a seek to a data page.<p>> This is why primary indexes are faster than secondary indexes, in general.<p>Clustered indexes are actually often not faster for many operations. A secondary index is often much faster if it covers the fields selected by the query without needing to do a bookmark lookup to data pages, and scan on secondary indexes are generally faster than clustered key scans, again moderated by whether you need to do bookmark lookups or not.",1292300565

2003104,comment,2000394,2001689,0,0,lucasjung,,,"I read through all ten parts, and found nothing to refute my post: the author provides no evidence that rich individuals stay rich while poor individuals stay poor.  In fact, the only piece that even touches on this subject actually supports my position: in part 7, the author notes that most of the very rich today earn their income through wages, rather than by leveraging inherited wealth.<p>In general, I am terribly surprised that this article received any upvotes: The author doesn't even bother at the pretense of objectivity, making no attempt to temper (or even hide) his political biases.  Furthermore, I found plenty of flaws in his reasoning--here are some highlights:<p>The author fails to consider the possibility that the U.S. has higher income inequality than Europe because of, rather than in spite of, the lower marginal tax rates on high-income earners in the U.S.  He repeatedly mentions the fact that Europe has lower income inequality and that the U.S. has lower top marginal income tax rates, but dismisses the importance of the latter out of hand rather than asking the question.<p>In part 1, the author conflates wealth disparity with income disparity when discussing Latin America: he mentions very poor people living in squalor outside of walled mansions and cites ""grotesque maldistribution of wealth"" as an oft-stated reason for societal problems in Latin America.  He then attempts to refute this explanation by pointing out that the United States has greater income disparity than many Latin American countries.  Wealth distribution != income distribution.<p>In section 3, the author discusses the impact of immigration on income inequality.  He fails to consider the fact that adding large numbers of low-income workers to the economy will reduce the income share of the lower quintiles by skewing average income in those quintiles downwards, regardless of how they impact the labor market for others.<p>In section 5, the author analyses income growth (and disparity in income growth) as a function of the president's political affiliation.  The unspoken assumption seems to be that this serves as a reasonable proxy for how liberal or conservative policies were at the time.  A far better choice would have been the party in control of the house: the president can influence tax and fiscal policy greatly, but it is congress that makes policy.  Furthermore, presidents tend to be less politically orthodox than representatives: for example, Kennedy set a relatively conservative fiscal and tax policy.<p>He finishes strong by populating section 10 with a handful of convenient straw men, which he then proceeds to tear down with great sanctimony.<p>About the only place where I agreed with the author was when he tied income growth to education in section 9, but he applied his same sloppy reasoning and so failed to make a very good argument.  If I had disagreed with him on this point, he wouldn't have changed my mind.",1292300201
