2041688,comment,2041296,2041296,0,0,A1kmm,,,"If the companies he is suing genuinely are spamming people they have no prior business relationship with, he is doing a service. But how often do people get truly unsolicited spam from overtly US based companies? All spam I've looked at recently has no connection to a business with any marketing model other than spam - generally sent through an open relay or compromised computer, with links with nameservers and HTTP hosted on a compromised system, and/or in China or a former USSR country. Unless you happen to know a lawyer in one of those countries, it would be difficult and prohibitively expensive to unmask their identities and still make a profit suing them.<p>I suspect, however, it is not genuinely unsolicited mail that he mainly goes after, but rather, solicited commercial mail which potentially fails to meet the requirements under California law. Suing companies not based in California who someone has initiated a relationship with on a technicality of Californian anti-spam law is, in my opinion, unfair - the companies had no say in the Californian law, and it is simply wrong to try to require every Internet business to comply with the laws of every jurisdiction in the world.",1293418195

I distilled his process which gave me the conclusion that the only place he could really see any efficiency gains were in fuel efficiency or cost.<p>He's using a 40+ year old design for his engine (with modern equipment).  His engine doesn't consist of fewer parts, it has a large R&D/Engineering budget, and carries with it the same launch pad staffing/rental fees that any other launch must have.  The only place he can really optimize his solution is more efficient engines, cheaper fuel or, a much more reusable system.  At this point, only the first booster stage is reusable and recovered which is possibly the least expensive part of his system.  As his avionics gear must continue with the launch vehicle, it becomes unrecoverable.<p>While I'm only an observer from afar, I believe his heavy lift capabilities will result in more fuel being required to make escape velocity.  There is a reason that most heavy-lift rockets use solid rocket boosters.<p>I really hope that they can bring down the cost of putting cargo into space.  From what I see now, I don't see him doing anything significantly different from Ariennespace's approach which can recover/reuse the booster stage.... which brings us back to the only real thing he can do to reduce cost is improve fuel efficiency/fuel cost.",1293417501
2041673,comment,2041165,2041394,0,0,kylec,,,"Initially when Quora was launched it seemed quite similar to Stack Overflow, but as the site has progressed it seems to me that it's actually quite divergent in terms of the core focus of the platform.<p>Stack Overflow is all about getting great answers to questions. Everything, from the reputation system, answer sorting, moderation, etc is designed so that the questions that are asked are on topic and objective, and that the best answers are situated right underneath. Not surprisingly, this focus was borne out of frustration with Experts Exchange playing tricks and hiding the answer to the question on the bottom of the page.<p>Quora, on the other hand, is all about social connection and discussion. It does have a ranking system, but kinds of questions and answers that are typically found on the site are much more subjective and are designed to encourage many people to weigh in and provide different points of view. Quora also places higher importance on the person's real name and employer than a Stack Overflow-like score for on-site contributions.<p>Overall, I think the title of Scoble's post (""Is Quora the biggest blogging innovation in 10 years?"") sums up the difference quite clearly - Quora clearly has more in common with blogging than it does with straight-up Q&A like Stack Overflow.",1293417457

But I think making people aware of the issues and why they matter is a good thing.  Hopefully, with education and time people will start to care and maybe things will change.<p>In fact, things are already changing.  Not so long ago almost all Americans were completely computer illiterate, and you had to be pretty exceptional to even have an email address or own a computer, much less care about electronic privacy.<p>Now most Americans own or at least have a computer, have email addresses, and are reasonably computer literate compared to how they were before the internet boom.  And there are exposes on various privacy and security issues in the printed news and even on television.<p>So slowly people are becoming more aware.  I expect this trend will only continue to increase now that more and more of the population are born in to the internet age and with a computer virtually in their crib almost from the day they were born.<p>Some of the most idealistic and privacy conscious people are the ones that are closest to technology and who are most adept at manipulating it and shaping its future.  And their numbers are also growing as the general population becomes more computer literate as a whole, and as there are more and more abuses of privacy by corporations and the government.<p>So I would not count the chickens of a privacyless age quite yet.  Remember that not long ago most people thought the collapse of the Soviet Union was as incredibly far off in the future (if it would ever happen at all).  And there are still people living who at one time thought that Segregation would never end.  And yet both Segregation and the Soviet Union did end.  Things did change.
