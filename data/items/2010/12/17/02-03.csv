I barely landed something new and made the rent in time. Never the less, I stuck to my principals. I made it really big on an exit, bet it all on investments and start-ups, lost it all, went another round after working some jobs, had two good exits and started playing it safer by switching to consulting, irregardless of all of that my core values and principals never wavered.

Query groups of two to three words in a search engine and look at the word count.  Then replace the word in question with other words that are similarly spelled and run a query with each.  The word with the highest result count is extremely likely to be the correct word.  Really, it's surprising how accurate it is.<p>The glory of this is that it works with proper nouns that don't occur in dictionaries (IE: xkcd).  In Google's initial demo for Wave, they showed ""Icland is an icland"" be corrected to ""Iceland is an island.""  I'm fairly confident they took a similar approach.  There's also a good chance it could work for other languages, because it doesn't use anything specific to English.<p>The disappointing part is that most of the accomplishment comes in ""Suggestion Intelligence First,"" meaning that from a list of 5, the top result is the correct result.  In most cases, the Suggestion Intelligence is just fine, you will just need to pick the right one yourself.<p>If anyone's interested, this was my presentation:\n<a href=""http://soe.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/gset/Presentation08-Hungarian.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://soe.rutgers.edu/sites/default/files/gset/Presentation...</a><p>And this was the ""research paper.""

Run as a business, rather than a free technology project liable to be side-lined on whatever whim, and really developed for the next 5 years, think about what it could be!  I mean, just look at what it is today on day one!<p>The offers will come, that much is certain; I can only hope they decide to go for it and turn this into something great.",1292551275

I thought, ""Oh, ok so it's like a cron task that's easier to manage but you pay for"" and then filed it away deep in my brain under ""Maybe someday I'll need that""<p>Maybe I'm mistaken but I don't see how it is even remotely similar to what these monitoring services provide. Can you explain that better?",1292551263

How responsive are the startup founders when I e-mail\n     them about problems?\n\n  2. How portable is the work I'm going to put into the \n     site? Data portability is actually probably my number \n     1 concern.\n\n  3. Does the service give me value that I couldn't \n     create with my own server after an hour of coding? \n     (Why would I sign up for yet another contacts service \n     when I can host my own LDAP server for free?)\n\n  4. Is there a vibrant community supporting the startup \n     from the get to?\n</code></pre>\nAt least these are the first that come to mind.",1292551231
