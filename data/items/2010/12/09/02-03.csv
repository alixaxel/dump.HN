In the state where I lived the police had two kinds of cameras.<p>Large fixed cameras were well marked a couple of kilometers ahead. You are only at risk for a short time, But you would be amazed how the Aussies drove right smack on the speed limit as soon as they saw the signs. Speeding under the camera netted you big points, double on holidays.<p>The other kind were unmanned mobile units in white vans. Typically placed in urban areas in plain sight (at the bottom of a hill--bastards!). A fine, but no points however.<p>Another Aussie state actually had a law that the cops could not hide while operating a radar gun.<p>I found the Aussies to be extremely aggressive drivers, but only at slow speeds and in parking lots. The only time I saw Mad Max, he was driving with 'P' plates or at Summer Nats.<p>Bottom line: visible enforcement is strong prevention. Most U.S. departments are really after the revenue.",1291863381

1985804,comment,1985652,1985652,0,0,mikeknoop,,,"I have a thought. There are already services that attempt to do this, with the exception that they do not automate the reporting: <a href=""http://www.trapster.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trapster.com/</a><p>Radar detectors are very finicky, and my understanding is that it is difficult to build a reliable one.<p>Now, my experience is with a specific model (and I think a very very popular one, the Passport 9500), it has an RJ45 connection which plugs into the unit and then the other end plugs into your car cigarette lighter for power. The end which plugs into your car cigarette lighter has a dongle and LED which flashes when radar has been detected (along with a mute button). There is two-way state information transmitted over the line in addition to power.<p>It would be awesome to build a ""man in the middle"" device to intercept and interpret the signals from popular device models, then send it's own signal to the iPhone/Android/WP7 phone to share the information.<p>This has the large benefit of being extremely cheaper to manufacture. Additionally, you're leaving the challenge of building the actual Radar Detection to well established companies who know what they are doing.<p>Additionally the service could look for patterns in the data. False positives are a huge problem with detectors. When every car is reporting radar 24/7 at this one location, you know it's most likely a false positive. Newer Passport models have this logic built in with GPS.",1291863341

1985800,comment,1984762,1984869,0,0,Alex3917,,,"It's not crazy at all. The natural state of the universe is constant change, and the only things that remain in existence for any amount of time are those that have forces to resist change. The reason all our atoms don't just fly apart is that there are forces pushing them back every time they try. And the reason social systems exist is that they push back every time something tries to fuck with them.<p>For example, right at the height of the holocaust the Albert Hoffman discovers the psychoactive properties of LSD, a drug that changes the social values of any population that uses it. The fact that LSD took over society right after the holocaust isn't a coincidence; that there were more scientific papers published about LSD than any other topic shows that something was seriously wrong with society and society was pushing back.<p>In the same way, the very fact that WikiLeaks exists is evidence of the corruption of our current system. And the reason it continues to exist is because WikiLeaks itself is developing the ability to fight back when attacked. What Anonymous is doing is the result of an infinitely complex series calculations that are ultimately being done to maintain social homeostasis.<p>edit: Newton's first is an inside job.

I hope this guy doesn't underestimate the engineering that goes into a quality radar detector these days. Belscort, Valentine, and Whistler spend millions of dollars and have decades of experience in the engineering. The ability to detect quick trigger, but also having the necessary DSP to filter out false signals being so important, I don't know if this will be a viable product anytime soon.<p>Edit: It appears he's using a Cobra radar detector.

Given that the US has over 5 credit cards per capita, it's relatively safe to assume that the 80% of households with a credit card literally translates into 80% of voters have a credit card as in it would be an insta-lose at the next election to be ""the party that knocked out credit cards for a month+""<p>Furthermore there are [3 (65% visa, 30% MC)] billion credit cards used outside of the US. If MC/Visa's assets were seized, the US would be under global shit for fucking up the global economy that it wouldn't even have to reach consumers in other countries before all hell broke loose.<p>What do you think the global repercussions of half the western world being unable to buy anything with credit for even a day?<p>Sorry, but it's a no brainer <i>not</i> to obey the government when they're making rice paper thin threats and to not even consult your legal department on the matter.
