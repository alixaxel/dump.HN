I went on in the second sentence to make it clear that I was drawing a contrast with pay for 'the most basic labor,' so as to avoid confusion. Once again ""what you do"" is what distinguishes you from any other warm body in the workplace. The poster is not talking about opting to earn slightly less than he might in a variety of other popular careers, he's talking about opting to earn slightly less than he could get in an entry-level unskilled job.<p>In economic terms, his choice to sell his services below the labor market's lowest rate for doing anything at all has a significant opportunity cost, to say nothing of the fact that he still has overhead and so on. A person who gets paid nothing at all is losing money because s/he still has to eat, buy clothes and so on. A person paid the market minimum is making a very small amount of money after life's necessities have been paid for, which is why we don't think of burger-flipping as a profitable career choice. Anyone charging less than this is working for zero profit, unless they are lucky enough to have free rent, food and so on.<p>What do you call a business plan which does not acknowledge any need to make a profit? Would you invest in such a business?",1291866724

What you need is just to hook up to these LEDs and you will support virtually any radar-detector available on the market. The cost of componets hardly exceeds $10. For extra $10 you can easily add bluetooth chip to get rid of wires coming to your iPhone and thus expending range of supported mobile devices. All this can be done by any EE student as a homework. Basic software can be written in J2ME to cover almost any cheap-phone. And this is what that guy is most likely doing.",1291865196
