Note the line about ""in this age of multicore processors"" at the end of the first paragraph.<p>And yet the GIL is still around. It seems to me that something's amiss here.<p>I looked in ""What's New In Python 3.2"" [1]. The ""Multi-threading"" section says the GIL has been improved, and refers to a message on the python-dev list [2] for details. That message says, in the second paragraph:<p>> There still is a Global Interpreter Lock ... so Python doesn't become really better at extracting computational parallelism out of several cores.<p>So does the author of this article not understand the difference between <i>parallelism</i> and <i>concurrency</i> (and the related performance issues for multi-core processors)?

1986663,comment,1986161,1986366,0,0,ladon86,,,"From his Playboy interview, aged 29:<p>Playboy: What does the money actually mean to you?<p>Jobs: I still don't understand it. It's a large responsibility to have more than you can spend in your lifetime--and I feel I have to spend it. If you die, you certainly don't want to leave a large amount to your children. It will just ruin their lives. And if you die without kids, it will all go to the Government. Almost everyone would think that he could invest the money back into humanity in a much more astute way than the Government could. The challenges are to figure out how to live with it and to reinvest it back into the world, which means either giving it away or using it to express your concerns or values.<p>Playboy: So what do you do?<p>Jobs: That's a part of my life that I like to keep private. When I have some time, I'm going to start a public foundation. I do some things privately now.<p>Playboy: You could spend all of your time disbursing your money.<p>Jobs: Oh, you have to. I'm convinced that to give away a dollar effectively is harder than to make a dollar.<p>Playboy: Could that be an excuse to put off doing something?<p>Jobs: No. There are some simple reasons for that. One is that in order to learn how to do something well, you have to fail sometimes. In order to fail, there has to be a measurement system. And that's the problem with most philanthropy--there's no measurement system. You give somebody some money to do something and most of the time you can really never measure whether you failed or succeeded in your judgment of that person or his ideas or their implementation. So if you can't succeed or fail, it's really hard to get better. Also, most of the time, the people who come to you with ideas don't provide the best ideas. You go seek the best ideas out, and that takes a lot of time.<p>Playboy: If you plan to use your visibility to create a model for people, why is this one of the areas you choose not to discuss?<p>Jobs: Because I haven't done anything much yet. In that area, actions should speak the loudest.<p><a href=""http://apps.ycombinator.com/item?id=1920287"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.ycombinator.com/item?id=1920287</a>",1291884203

Financial services will re-evaluate the risks of this kind of attack vs. the cost of assigning more resources to guard against it.<p>2. Governments will finally start taking IT security seriously.<p>The latter is the more interesting, because while banks are generally reasonably clued up about balancing risks and will simply adjust their current practices, elected representatives who aren't technically inclined will probably be discolouring their underwear over the fall-out if the bad guys really tried to do some damage, given that it is this easy for a few upset people to cripple the world's payment systems.<p>I suspect that as a reuslt, we can look forward to increasingly draconian penalties being introduced for this sort of action in most jurisdictions, the end of on-line anonymity as it has been known, and ruthless throttling/disconnection of entire ISPs/countries that don't play ball with either of the above. If you thought government reactions to copyright infringement were heavy-handed, I imagine they will look like a nun comforting a child compared to what is coming next.<p>The sad thing is that better security, robustness, user authentication, etc. should have been built into the Internet by default for years, but the same ""Wild West"" evolution that was so successful in the early days has also been a poor driver of consolidation now that the Internet isn't just a toy for the military types and the universities any more. Maybe the Powers That Be will finally start taking serious advice about IT from people who know what they're talking about and collectively give the issues the attention they deserve.
