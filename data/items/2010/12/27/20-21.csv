Sure, they could make money like the way Steam do (<a href=""http://store.steampowered.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.steampowered.com</a>) but not with this specific model. There is legs in the bundle model, but I don't think it requires any investment... it's a 0 capital start up, they've made their name so when they approach other indie developers they can work based on their name alone.<p>I would however seriously hope they don't do what you're suggesting (weekly) the idea has very limited usage, there are a finite number of games out there and a finite amount of interest, this works based on the publicity (""Viral marketing"") and not just the idea.

Most moral philosophers who take animal rights seriously (chiefly among them Peter Singer, if you're familiar with the name) are utilitarians. But a utilitarian is absolutely willing to cause small amounts of suffering to alleviate larger amounts of suffering, because it's a net positive in the ""pleasure calculus"".[2]<p>If you're not a utilitarian, then suffering isn't a morally relevant concern and you base your morality on something else, usually some set of universal rules and principles governing interactions between people.[3] These rules and principles tend to be reciprocal by design, only governing how moral agents treat other moral agents. Sheep aren't capable of moral agency, so even from a deontological perspective you are unlikely to come up with any sort of moral duty not to herd sheep with dogs.<p>Let's be clear here: I'm sure you could rationalize some type of moral system where it's wrong to herd sheep with dogs, and I'm wary of this discussion turning into an exercise to do just that. But I don't think that's the type of moral system you would ever naturally arrive at if you weren't being tendentious about that specific point.<p>[1] This is a naive kind of utilitarianism: Mill's utilitarianism also takes into account the quality, not merely the quantity, of pleasure or suffering involved, and there have been further philosophical refinements, none of which change the basic point here.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=599"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=599</a><p>[3] The textbook example is Kant's categorical imperative: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative</a>",1293482261

No, survival is a purely utilitarian exercise. You find a stable niche and fill it, or die. In other words humans and their brains have just stumbled upon a particular pattern of living (what with language and societies and ""intelligence"") that is currently ""stable"". What if in 500 years all humans are extinct, yet bacteria still happily do their thing. Would we still consider humans so 'intelligent'? The same rule applies to processes embodied in silicon as to processes embodied in carbon.

So far, my only guess is that their plan is to turn the 'indie bundle' into a repeatable business model, where they either get paid to run bundles for individual developers, or they turn a profit solely on the 'tip to the bundle operator' that's included as one of the sliders when you make a purchase. For obvious reasons, relying on the tip seems like a risky model, but it's possible that they could find success by charging a flat fee to developers and then collecting the tip as extra upside. Valve certainly hasn't been doing badly through turning Steam into a distribution platform for indies, so there's probably still room in that market.",1293480757

The classic example in Javascript is inheritence. In his ""Advanced Javascript"" talks, Crockford lists three different patterns for inheritence, each of which is incompatible with the others.  Furthermore, I know from experience that each of the techniques has some severe drawbacks - some (such as Crockford's ""parasite inheritence"") are incredibly wasteful of resources, keeping a copy of each function declared for the object with every instance.  Others, such as ""pseudoclassical inheritence"" don't work if you want to inherit from a native object.<p>I use Javascript for my day job, but my favourite language is Ruby.  And I can't help missing the fact that it is much easier to share code with other people in Ruby (largely because it does have defined mechanisms for code reuse) than it is in Javascript.  I'll never get two objects in Ruby that can't be used the same way because their system of construction is different.<p>I appreciate that such flexibility helps with the expressiveness of the language, but when expressiveness comes with the price of not being able to easily work with others, I can't help wondering if the price is too high.",1293480055
