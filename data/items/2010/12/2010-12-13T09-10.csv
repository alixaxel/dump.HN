1999981,comment,1999812,1999812,0,0,abecedarius,,,"This nicely describes the process and some advantages of TDD. I think it skates over what repels some programmers: the amount of ceremony and typing in that process. If you want to hack something up quick you aren't going to start by typing up<p><pre><code>    object MiddleOutNumberSorterSpec extends Specification with ScalaCheck {

      ""MiddleOutNumberSorter"" should {
        ""reject even number counts and throw an exception"" in { }
        ""return a list of the same length as the count specified"" in { }
        ""produce 3 numbers in the correct order"" in { }
        ""produce 5 numbers in the correct order"" in { }
        ""produce 15 numbers in the correct order"" in { }
      }  
    }

A friend of mine basically quit his job over this issue at a TDD-only startup, so he said. I need to write up a post about what I do instead.<p>(To be fair, in classical TDD you only write one test to start.)",1292234267

I'm pretty sure that in modern browsers new Array(length) doesn't allocate anything, it just sets the length property. The results I'm seeing would agree with Google really.<p>Perhaps you were seeing GC events slowing down the test?<p>The other thing about for(var i=0;i<arr.length;i++) is it can end up as an infinite loop if you're modifying the length inside the for loop:<p><pre><code>  for (var i=0;i<arr.length;i++) {

Patent your business first!<p>Before you sell <i>anything</i> to a big corporation, you should hava a patent ready for your product.<p>Why? because without a patent your product is a commodity and will be treated as such by the procurement dept. at the big corporation.<p>In my country (Spain) we don't have software patents, and this is what happens:<p>- The first year you sell the product to the big corporation. You're happy and rejoice.<p>- The next year, before  you're about to renew the licensing agreement, the procurement departament asks several competing companies (mostly big contractors) for a ""similar"" product (where ""similar"" means, cheaper, with more or less the same functionality). Nobody has it, so you get the contract.<p>- The third year, one (or two) big contractors bid against you with a competing product and you have to lower your price to keep the contract.<p>- The fourth year, you cannot compete in price against the big contractors because they sell the ""competing"" product as a turnkey project... at the low per-hour rates big companies pay.<p>Hope this helps.

For what it's worth (and I know this is also weak evidence) when I've looked at an article and thought ""Wow, HN should have used a different title for this"" it's much much much more often been because of editorializing by the submitter than because the original article title was used but wasn't very good.<p>We need moderators aggressively retitling articles submitted with stupid or biased titles.

But I'm not sure if there's any job out there in the internets that can be taught in a short timespan.</i><p>That's a cool idea. On of the easiest that comes to mind would be chopping Photoshop files for Wordpress themes or HTML/CSS templates - it might seem somewhat daunting but if you gave her a starting point she would basically just have to cut and paste into the right parts a lot of the time. Even though there are tons of people already doing it I suspect that finding and partnering with a good designer would still be quite profitable. Depending on her English skills, another option would be getting into SEO - there's still a lot of room for growth in that market and the technical requirements can sometimes be fairly minimal. Copywriting might be an applicable related field, whether in her native language or by offering translation services from English to her native language (obviously depends on her English reading and what her native language is).<p><i>she's a financial director [I dunno what they call this position] in the biggest company in the city</i><p>A more industrious option might be to try leveraging your combined experience. There are endless opportunities for providing very basic and extremely niche enterprise apps which pay pretty nicely. She may have some ideas in this regard related to her job, either for an application that would make a common task easier or that would just compete with a complicated app. One of my favourite models is to compete with a complicated ancient piece of enterprise software by <i>reducing</i> the feature set and offering it for cheaper.
