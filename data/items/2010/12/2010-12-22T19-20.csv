I've seen ""bytecodes"" that qualify as high-level languages by this standard, like CPython bytecode. Is that even so surprising? Single bytecodes for OO languages can translate to a <i>lot</i> of work to resolve.<p>And, what about Forth? It's a fairly low-level language by this standard. It has convenient ways to link together a lot of little functions, but one word does not dispatch on types and expand operator overloading and do the other things that can result in one line of C++ producing half a kilobyte of code, to say nothing of the functions that half-a-kilobyte may be invoking.

  JEREMY In baseball, if the final four batters scored 16 runs, it's be hard to consider that perfect.
  CASEY Right.  Jeremy, I don't know how comfortable I am reporting a story I don't understand.

Rather than thinking of it as baseball for the English, I'd suggest reading that wiki page linked to.<p>And FYI, both baseball and cricket are great games, but from my experience... if you like cricket, go learn about baseball and watch a few games, it's fantastic.

2032194,comment,2031977,2031977,0,0,cheald,,,"Fair warning: Most of this is criticism (constructive, I hope). I'm American and not much of a baseball fan, so I'm certainly not your target audience, but I can give feedback on my impressions. I'm not trying to tear it up - I just want to be helpful. I'm a developer more than a designer, so take my design feedback with a grain of salt.<p>Initial impressions: I'm not wild about the color scheme. The green background in particular sort of messes up the contrast of the rest of the design. The ""learn more"" link is barely visible on that yellow background, which is probably going to cause conversion problems. Try something like this: <a href=""http://colorschemedesigner.com/#2v51T2GtNw0w0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://colorschemedesigner.com/#2v51T2GtNw0w0</a><p>You're billing this as a social tool, but you're missing the biggest potential social leg-up - logging in with Facebook/Twitter. You get social connections and reach baked in with that; doing Yet Another Proprietary Login is going to hurt conversions and make mapping your own piece of the social graph harder than you need to.<p>Paddings are inconsistent - the ""Predict/Join"" button is indented more to the right than other elements relative to box edges. ""Overall Standing"" has more padding up top than similar elements. This leads to it feeling a bit sloppy.<p>I've got a horizontal scroll bar at 1920x1200, but can't figure out why. Minor annoyance. Sidebar boxes are different widths, which detracts from the page layout.<p>Inconsistent fonts - serif in some places, sans-serif in others - are distracting.<p>From a code perspective, the page is littered with inline styles - you'll find it a lot easier to manage moving forward if you do all your styling in a CSS file via class selectors. I highly, HIGHLY recommend Compass + Sass for this - it will streamline style management like you wouldn't believe. It'll also get you a 960 grid to work on, which can help address a lot of your alignment/padding issues.<p>I have no feel for the market for this sort of thing, but my hunch is that if you can really drive home the social aspect of it - friendly competition between friends - you might have a neat app on your hands.

This was pretty irritating since I am in the habit of highlighting text while I read. Now there is a constant black bar that tells me to sign in to journal and/or highlight, which is also annoying, but less so.<p>Secondly, the new layout is not fluid horizontally -- it is horizontally centered and seems to be tailored for 1024x768 audiences. It's much worse attempting to read scriptures or articles on my 1920x1080 screen with gobs of excess space on the screen, now only occupied by blue gradient. The text used to flow well and take up all available screen space due to the simple layout of the site -- the revision not only horizontally centers everything, but even cuts the container down, with ""Share"" and ""Download"" links on the sidebar. The text is spaced awkwardly and it's just a great big waste of screen real estate. I read the print version most of the time (now I use the old one since they brought the old scriptures back), but it doesn't have footnote toggle and the spacing is still weird; at least, however, it doesn't waste 50% of my horizontal screen space. Loading footnotes can be tiresome, as the site makes an AJAX call on load; I'd much prefer preloaded footnotes. The new chapter selection page makes it harder to find the chapter you want -- you can either scroll a lot and use the same number of clicks or click on the jump menu and add an extra click in there.<p>There are some cool things about the new site, and I like the use of HTML5 font faces and other things like that, but for the most part it's less usable for more shininess.

2032123,comment,2031500,2031886,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Your link to the DEA shows a total 9 news releases relating to marijuana enforcement actions for 2009-2010. This compares with 15 for 2008, 15 for 2007, 16 for 2006, and so on. Your CBS link quotes the DEA's 'record number of pot seizures' but the actual story makes clear that the record is set by the number of seized plants rather than the number of enforcement actions.<p>The grandparent post observed that that the federal government was 'not harassing people...nearly as much as the previous administration.' It did not make any claims that federal enforcement had halted. Indeed, your linkage seems to support rather than refute the claim that was made.<p>I don't support drug prohibition, but I have to take the outraged complaints about the federal government with a pinch of salt; California voters had the opportunity to legalize the growing, possession and sale of pot 6 weeks ago and decided not to do so. I have heard numerous people mentioning that they voted against it or didn't want it to pass because it would have impacted the business of someone they know in the trade, since legalization would probably have led to a price collapse, at least in the short term. Whether this perspective was held by enough people to alter the outcome of the voting I do not know, but it seems the police are not the only ones invested in the <i>status quo</i>.",1293045043

You can't have ""varb function(arg)"" or its equivalent in any language I know, because it doesn't make <i>sense</i> - there's no operation on the varb, it's just ""there"".  Similarly, ""x y z = q r t"" is unambiguous, because there's no stop to parsing either ""x y z"" or ""q r t"".<p>I think I'd like it.  Hitting shift all the time, or reaching for ""_"" is a PITA and significantly slows my typing.  It's especially annoying when you realize that identifiers with blanks could be leveraged into most languages with almost zero change to the parser, as long as it <i>requires</i> an end-of-statement terminator or ends on newlines.",1293044627
