2036591,comment,2034624,2036105,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"I'm a strict atheist, but I'm also a descendant of Western civilization (formerly known as ""Christendom""). As such, I spend the Christmas season as my forefathers have for the last few thousand years - enjoying the heightened good cheer of my fellow men, relishing the opportunity to spend time with my friends and family, and counting my blessings.<p>Hacker News is a news site, but it is also a community of hackers. If a HNer needs a place to stay in Mountain View or is in trouble in some other way, I would try to help them. As such, the occasional touch of a human element is appropriate. I feel it is acceptable to send my fellow hackers the traditional good wishes and cheer as my civilization (and most of theirs) have done during this time of year for generations, while not seeking to be exclusionary or force my beliefs on anyone. I see it as the digital analogue of taking a moment of time at a technical conference to tell my colleague that I hope his family is doing well. I would hope he wouldn't snap back at me that it was off-topic.<p>It seems that aggressive atheists are more annoying than Christians nowadays.",1293166283

2036553,comment,2036381,2036492,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Sweet spot is more 'best bang for the buck' - you can go lower than that, but you'll have to sacrifice either latency or frequency resolution. Have a look at the comparison chart for some context: <a href=""http://www.celt-codec.org/comparison/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.celt-codec.org/comparison/</a><p>32kbps is not the lowest possible, obviously, but it's still very very low. Like that's near-realtime encoding at quite high quality at a bitrate low enough to go over an old modem. Normal uncompressed 16-bit 48khz stereo audio (the most popular yardstick since the establishment of DVD) is 1536 kbps. Remember that's kiloBITS per second, and two channels of 16-bit audio are taking up 32 bits per sample. At 32 kbps without any compression you'd be limited to a 1 khz sample rate which about as smooth as a cheesegrater. Compressing audio in almost real time by a factor of 48 and still having it sound this good is astonishing, trust me. If you didn't do so already, find the picture of the spectrogram and look at the uncompressed and mp3 plots for a while. Then look at how much more faith the CELT codec is to the source material. Their insight about maintaining energy of each coding band at unity is <i>extremely</i> impressive, one of the cleverest things I've seen in DSP since perceptual coding (which is what mp3 does).<p>If digital signal processing and the like stimulates your intellectual curiosity then I urge you to learn more about it - it's a really interesting and very useful field of study, with all sorts of interesting applications and lots of territory still unexplored. The Scientist's and Engineer's Guide to DSP is a fairly basic introductory text, but has two massive advantages of all its competitors: it is available for free at the author's website, and it is extremely well written. Other books can tell you what you need to know. The DSP guide tells you why you need to know, and why the fundamental algorithms are so elegant. <a href=""http://www.dspguide.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dspguide.com/</a>",1293164733

Speech uses a different frequency range from distorted guitar, and a different range from a synthesized bass tone. When you hear the metallic-swirl artifacts in low bitrate MP3s, it's always coming from the highs of cymbals and electric guitars.<p>With the lower bound recommendation, they are guaranteeing that you will affect _any_ material by going below 32kbps, which is a useful piece of data; one can optimize material for size by starting there and gradually moving upwards until the sound is as transparent as necessary.",1293164362

Before long, these clouds let forth a surplus of unique, sticky snowflakes. These snowflakes came to litter the ground. A child looked out and observed his frontyard which had been transformed into a winter wonderland. Rushing outside, he rolled the snow into 3 large orbs descending in size; thus he made the snow into the likeness of a man. The sun was shining warm as he worked. All was happy.<p>However, as the sun continued to come out, the falling snow quickly turned to rain. The rain came down upon the snow, and working with the sunlight, the snow quickly went away. As the snow disappeared, so too did the snowman. The snowman bore a slow death as he melted to the ground. Such sorrow was wrought, until the final death had at last approached.",1293164340
