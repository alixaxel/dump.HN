1605106,comment,1604915,1604915,0,0,samdk,,,"Web design is a really broad field. You need to understand HTML and CSS, you need to understand the limitations of web browsers as a medium, you need to understand how users interact with webpages, and you need to have a decent handle on typography/visual design. I don't have good tutorials/articles for all of these areas, unfortunately: they're things I've learned over a pretty long period of time by reading a lot of different disparate articles. In general, A List Apart (<a href=""http://www.alistapart.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alistapart.com/</a>) is an excellent resource for articles on design. While it's frequently linked, a lot of the stuff on Smashing Magazine (<a href=""http://smashingmagazine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smashingmagazine.com/</a>) is awful. Their articles on how to do things with HTML/CSS are usually decent, but their articles about actual <i>design</i> usually demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of what good design is. I'm also haven't really found any resources with good exercises. One of the things about design is that you really need to be getting feedback from a real person. If you're doing things and would like design-related feedback, I'm usually happy to give it. (My email is in my profile.)<p>For learning HTML and CSS I recommend HTML Dog (<a href=""http://htmldog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://htmldog.com/</a>). It's a bit dated and won't cover HTML5/CSS3 stuff at all, but it does teach good practices, and I haven't found anything better.<p>I also haven't found a good article/tutorial on web browser limitations. You need to be aware of web browser width (people generally design for a 1024px wide browser these days, which means about a 960px wide site), how colors work on different monitors (some monitors display colors a lot more nicely than others), serif fonts don't display well at small sizes, it's important to use fonts designed for the screen, different browsers look different, and a bunch of other things.<p>You also need to be aware that not everyone using a computer can see as well as you, and that it's important to design so that people who are colorblind can use your site (there are a lot more of them than you might think), and so that people who use screen readers are able to understand and navigate your site.<p>For learning how users interact with your websites, I recommend Jakob Nielson's writing (<a href=""http://www.useit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.useit.com/</a>). I don't agree with all of the conclusions he draws from his research, but the raw data he presents is informative. One other important thing to note is that some of the information about how people interact with websites has changed a lot over the past ten years. A study done ten years ago isn't necessarily accurate today, because people are generally a lot more comfortable with using a web browser than they used to be.<p>My general rule for web usability is to not play too much with people's expectations. People know that things that are underlined are often links, and so I avoid underlining things unless they're links (there are nicer ways to emphasize something visually, anyway). Similarly, if you have a hover effect on a button, make sure you can click the whole button, and not just the text inside the button. Make sure to keep your styling relatively consistent across a site: it will make much more sense to the people trying to use it. One of the best things you can do for usability is to put someone who's never seen your site in front of a computer and watch them try to use it. People do some things that may seem <i>very</i> strange, and it's really hard to catch all of them.<p>Visual design itself is a huge field: I recommend you get started with typography because it's extremely important, most people don't understand it at all, and you can decent designs out of boxes and type. Typography for Lawyers (<a href=""http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.typographyforlawyers.com/</a>) is one of the best general overviews of typography I've seen online. There are lawyer-specific details, but the basics are mostly all there. It's important to remember it's more a guide for print than for the web though, and that influences things like the font choices presented.<p>In general, remember that design is about <i>purpose</i>, not about making something look pretty. Decide what the point of your design is, and do everything with that in mind. Are you designing to make people buy a product? To interest people in a subject? Are you trying to make a point, or to start a conversation? Every time you're making a decision, remember what the purpose of your design is, and let that be what makes your decisions for you.",1281879099

Let's use my circumstances for an example.<p>I live an hour from any city. I do well enough financially, so parking taxes will not effect me one way or the other (neither would a gasoline tax). Within an mile of where I live, there are probably another 100 families. Most of them do not do so well. I live in a very rural and poor area. One family I know is a single mom and teenage daughter. While their housing is provided by family, each of them makes minimum wage and have to drive to the city to work. They barely keep one car running and the lights on at home.<p>Now I believe you are saying we should tax them for parking in the city. Then give everybody the money back from the tax. Perhaps at the end of the year when they file their taxes.<p>This would be devastating to these folks. Sure, you'd cut down on car use, but at what cost? For every middle-income person who took a few less trips, how many low-income people did you just kick out of work?<p>Did I understand that correctly? And please, no ""but those folks are living the wrong way!"" comments. These people are living as best as they can. One social engineering event per conversation, please. The point is to defend, explain, or analyze the article in question. The essay seemed to me to be the kind of pontificating that looks good from the ivory tower living in the city, but has very limited real application to the rest of the country, aside from hurting people for a noble cause.",1281878094

Most municipalities have long knowledge of transportation patterns, and they know that when an establishment has insufficient parking, it causes grief for neighbours.<p>People end up circling the area indefinitely, or they park illegally on neighbouring grounds, etc.<p>The real social engineering are articles like this that are, as someone else mentioned, essentially propaganda pieces.<p>There are places where vehicles aren't appropriate or as usable -- dense urban centres -- and in those places most people <i>don't</i> drive. Most New Yorkers don't own a car. People living in downtown TO condos don't own a car. That is great, but that density and very expensive mass transit system doesn't carry forth to the suburbs, exurbs, or rural areas, so save the rhetoric.",1281877861

In a Times New Roman vs Arial battle, Arial tends to come out on top. But that may well be because it has a larger x-height.<p>When you poll users on their preferences they love sans-serif fonts. But a big part of the problem is that so few serif fonts come installed in all browsers. Times New Roman seems to be a poor screen font, and Georgia is better but isn't installed everywhere. In short, the fact that we prefer sans serif fonts for the web may be an artifact of our crappy selection of web fonts.<p>It will be <i>very</i> interesting to see if and when serifs stage a comeback in the era of 300dpi displays and, more importantly, a much larger choice of fonts.",1281877411

The service is relatively cheap, there are a ton of resources for learning there and the podcasts are generally much more interesting than Pimsleur and other methods.  I signed up for Chinesepod a little bit before I took a college class for Mandarin and I believed Chinesepod to be better for learning the vocab and characters.  The college class was obviously better for pronunciation and real conversation because we had a great instructor and podcasts don't give feedback.  You could supplement Chinesepod with remote conversations and tutors though.  I believe they also have a network for this sort of thing.  It's the cheapest option I know of.<p>If you have no funds at all, then you could probably find people willing to have conversation with you for free through the net and teach you some things in exchange for you offering the same with English.",1281877410
