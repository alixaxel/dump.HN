The question is whether or not Facebook has a history of doing this.  I'm not aware of one.<p>A platform becoming your competitor is fair game, and doesn't imply they will do anything sneaky like making their platform any less accessible to you.  Microsoft is in the Operating System business, but MS Office is a fair competitor to other office suites that run on Windows.<p>I understand the concern about Facebook though, because they aren't (yet) a platform like Windows is.  Microsoft started out making the platform, and then built some nice user facing applications to go on top of it.  MS Office uses the same OS system calls that are available to every Windows developer.<p>Facebook started out as a user facing product (facebook.com) and then pushed down into the stack.  The issue with that is that facebook.com and other Facebook products are based on leaky abstractions.  They don't just sit on top of the Facebook platform.  They can do things with the social graph that no 3rd party application can do.  This is where Facebook can have an unfair advantage, and why people are worried about building on top of them.<p>The good thing is that Facebook is working on sealing off the abstraction barrier between their platform and their products.  Look at the evolution of their API's.  MUCH better social applications are going to pop up once we can all build the same user-facing products that Facebook can build.  The great thing is that it's in their best interest.  Facebook is much more powerful as Windows than as MS Office.",1282887835

I can't think of one.<p>I would say that one-time $1 products are in almost all cases unadvertisable. It's an economically inefficient use of advertising space. The best case scenario when someone sees his ad is a payoff of $0.70. That's the <i>ceiling</i> for the value of the an ad impression, and in reality it's pretty much guaranteed to be far, far lower.<p>Compare that to, say, advertising a car, where the payoff of a conversion may be several thousand (in profit). Sure, the conversion rate won't be as high because it's so expensive, but the potential pay-off is so much higher that it doesn't matter.<p>The only ads I can see for products that cheap are consumables (like gum). There's a reason for that. Unless the ad space is seen by a niche that's incredibly likely to buy your product (yet for some reason not already own it), there are other companies that can get much more value out of that ad space, which means that there are companies willing to pay more for it than the revenue it will get you.",1282887372

1638054,comment,1636099,1636954,0,0,wuputah,,,"In my opinion, Bundler deprecates the need--or at least the need in most cases--to use gemsets. They are still a great feature to give you great control over exactly which gems are installed for testing purposes, but once you switch your applications to using Bundler, there's rarely a need to keep each project in its own gemset.<p>What Bundler does is establish a container for all gems (and ONLY those gems) that your application needs to run. This is much like an automatic, application-specific gemset.<p>It also solves the difficult problem of resolving your applications dependencies, locking your gems to a particular set of dependencies to assure consistency across environments and deployments. This is a very critical feature and really showed its ugly head when Rails 2.3.8 was released. Users suddenly found their projects breaking because one gem would load the latest version of activesupport installed on their system (e.g. activesupport-2.3.8) while Rails would require exactly version 2.3.5. Bundler solves this problem by determining that 2.3.5 is the correct dependency and locks the application to only load that version.<p>It is exactly because of this feature that gemsets are now rarely needed. A large repository of gems will no longer cause you pain and hassle, as Bundler will pick and choose (or install) whichever gems you need to run the project. No more manual management of gemsets.
