I guarantee you a lot of people will look at this site and go, ""Holy cow, that name is total nonsense,"" because the two doubled letters in a row make it no longer resemble the word ""jump"" so much as a cat walking on a keyboard. Personally, my skim-reading more closely associates it with the word ""app"" than ""jump,"" which makes me want to read it as ""jumapp.""<p>My personal recommendation: For maximum readability, consider something like ""letsjump.in"".

A client asked me to help negotiate a software license agreement drafted by the other side’s lawyer. I saw that the other lawyer had selectively copied and edited a  set of model software license provisions developed by an ABA committee. It amused my client when, on the negotiation conference call, I pointed out to the other lawyer that he had left out certain language that had been included in the model provisions to make them a reasonable compromise on the issue in question.  The other lawyer was a bit discomfited when he realized that I was the lead author of the model provisions and the chairman of the drafting committee.

We get the term 'left-wing' from the French Revolution, where in the Revolutionary Assembly, those who gathered on the left side of the Assembly were more radical than those who gathered on the right. During the height of the Terror, the left side killed the right side and the center moved to the left. At their peek, the Jacobins were every bit as dogmatic and psuedo-religious as Greenpeace, (they were in fact explicit about their attempts to create a new religion.) Soviet Bolshevism presents a similar story but I won't get into it.<p>'Conservativism' is different than 'right wing,' and 'liberalism' is different than 'left wing.'<p>The standard polisci definition is that (small 'c') 'conservatives' seek slow organic change in society while (small 'l') 'liberals' seek deliberate and intentional change. In addiction we have 'radicals,' who seek total change and an overthrow of the current system, and 'reactionaries' who either want no change, or to reverse the flow. ('Radical conservative,' is an oxymoron') Big 'C' Conservatives and big 'L' Liberals are different still, (and both are different than 'Progressives.')<p>Greenpeace is radical, left-wing movement.

1589502,comment,1588934,1588934,0,0,kalk,,,"I won't pretend I'm predisposed in its favor, but the arguments in this article are really pretty terrible.<p>Take this paragraph from the first section, just about the only attempt to present big-picture numbers:<p>""Between 2003 and 2007, California state and local government spending grew 31 percent, even as the state’s population grew just 5 percent.""<p>The article doesn't say if the 31% is inflation adjusted - which makes me suspect it's not. Also, what's happened since 2007? That was three years ago. Why cherry-pick numbers from the height of the housing boom, which presumably saw steadily increasing revenue? Is that the only way to show a dramatic spending increase and validate the article's thesis?<p>""The overall tax burden as a percentage of state income, once middling among the states, has risen to the sixth-highest in the nation, says the Tax Foundation.""<p>No periodization here at all, and then we get...<p>""Since 1990, according to an analysis by California Lutheran University, the state’s share of overall U.S. employment has dropped a remarkable 10 percent.""<p>How much of this occurred over the 2003-2007 period that saw increasing spending? From anything the article tells us, the answer might very well be none. What was the population doing in the meantime? Again, for all I know, it might have changed proportionately.<p>If one was to look up numbers that all covered the same time periods, I don't know what results one would get. But the numbers in the article really don't set up the case it goes on to make, that the problem is spending and regulation.<p>And then that case has its own independent issues. Though again I don't have quick access to the real numbers, it's not plausible to me that ""bureaucratic pensions"" are really a substantial proportion of the state budget, unless teachers, firefighters, and prison guards are all alike ""bureaucrats"", a characterization which would be pretty tendentious.

</code></pre>
- education:<p><pre><code>  - not quite as good as the top schools in the west for
    many subjects but *very* good in some, such as math,
    engineering and such
</code></pre>
- unemployment:<p><pre><code>  - non-existent. For everybody, no matter how low on the
    totem pole there was a job, even if it meant bad pay
    and long hours. But bad pay and long hours are to be
    found in plenty of places, the USA and Canada are no
    exception to this
</code></pre>
- health care<p><pre><code>  - free. And of a reasonable standard. Ok, you wouldn't 
    be able to get some fancy surgery so your life
    expectancy wasn't quite up to it from that point 
    of view, but on the whole I would say it was simpler,
    more humane and in many ways better than some of the
    more extreme cases in the west (Terri Schiavo anybody?)
</code></pre>
- happiness:<p><pre><code>  - difficult to gauge. People that I knew when living in
    the east block compared to the west before the fall 
    of the wall and the 'iron curtain' were on the whole 
    as happy or happier than those that I knew in the west.

    Friendships were real and lasted a lifetime in many
    cases, family ties were fairly closely knit and
    children were on the whole loved and safe, much safer
    than those 'free' children in the west. Again, 
    officials would occasionally mess things up for the
    people but in this respect people did form a block. 
</code></pre>
- information<p><pre><code>  - Even though the punishments were severe there was a
    lively underground in the form of samizdat (sp?) and
    'culture houses' were movies from the west were shown
    to friends. And not just the Hollywood movies, also 
    those from other countries. So the people there had a 
    limited view of what was going on in the rest of the 
    world through the official channels, which mostly
    read like 'good news' and 'motivational' stories.
    (I recall one front page article about a girl 
    that had broken the record in nursing her kid or
    something to that effect), it was seriously delayed 
    but between the drip feed of information from 
    travelers, radio free europe, the bbc world service 
    and a whole pile of other channels people were
    remarkably well informed.
</code></pre>
- standard of living<p><pre><code>  - about the same as in the west 25 years earlier. So 
    colour tv's were fairly common but so were b&w sets
    relatively few people with a quality car, plenty 
    of two-strokes (trabant, wartburg, syrena, polonez
    zil, dacia and other brands that you may have never
    heard of) Plenty of stuff only available by waiting
    for years, lots of stuff that you'd take for granted
    in the west inexplicably unavailable, not unexceptional
    for 'hamstering' behaviour of a few individuals to 
    cause shortages in for instance toilet paper, light
    bulbs and stockings. Very lively black market. For the
    most part people had fairly healthy food on the table,
    but they were structurally short on things like fruit
    and fresh vegetables out of season.
</code></pre>
- your job<p><pre><code>  - your job is, unless you are a lucky person and you're
    in some prestigious place probably terribly boring
    tons of layers of bureaucracy slow everything down to 
    a crawl. Procuring the simplest of items required to 
    do your job require endless forms and always at least
    three signatures and two stamps. Promotion is hardly
    ever, and when it happens it tends to ignore your 
    proficiency in favor of someone with better connections.
    On the whole the 'general workforce' takes work for
    granted and produces enough to get by but stellar 
    performances are the exception. If you want to advance
    there is a path, but it leads through the 'party', and
    if you're good at something then doors can be opened
    provided you dance to the tune. If you're in to sports
    then you can go quite far too.
</code></pre>
- mentality<p><pre><code>  - there is a low-key paranoia that pervades society, 
    don't let you guard down in front of strangers, 
    you never know if they're taking names or informing.
    Everybody knows somebody that knows somebody that
    disappeared, but hardly anybody knows somebody that
    disappeared (and why), but it definitely does happen.

The property tax rate (the percentage of the value of your home that you must pay every year) cannot be reduced, because many property owners are paying that percentage on the values of their homes twenty years ago or more. This makes the tax rate very unfavorable for new owners and very good for those who have owned since Prop 13 was passed in 1978. If everybody paid tax based on their current home price (an order of magnitude difference for some properties), the tax _rate_ could be reduced for everybody (though many would end up paying more tax).<p>Edit: re-reading my original comment, I should have made clear that I was talking about the property tax rate, not the dollar amount assessed, which will of course be different for everybody.",1281388944

If the business ties into the physical world in some way and the agreement is that you handle the technology while he handles everything else then this arrangement seems like a good match. If instead, the business is entirely virtual then you may be setting yourself up for frustration.<p>I have run 2 virtual-only businesses with partnerships such as the one you have stated and each time it ended in frustration, unlike my real+virtual businesses which were successful. The problem with being the only person with technical skills in a virtual-only business is as follows:<p>1. Your effort and risk is typically front-loaded, meaning that you are required to create the entire product before your partner is able to utilize the majority of their skills operating the business.<p>2. If he is financing the business then prepare to feel like an employee. The money guy is usually the decision guy as well.<p>3. Prepare to possibly be taken for granted. Many non-technical partners read media headlines regarding overseas outsourcing, teenage tech geniuses, and turnkey software. This avalanche of information gives them the impression that technical work is easily and cheaply contracted or purchased. The truth is that paying for technical talent capable of creating a quality product is still ridiculously expensive. Unfortunately this is something that is usually learned through past experience so hopefully your partner either has that experience or is smart enough to see through the media hype.<p>4. The work never ends. Unlike a technical partnership where everyone carries equal workload, you are responsible for it all. Every bug, every update and every post-launch adjustment that takes your partner 5 seconds to request and you 5 hours to implement. It's all on you, and as a startup don't expect to get quality technical help anytime soon.<p>5. We are all biased. Nothing is more annoying then spending 18 hours coding only to see your partner make a few phone calls and call it a day. Even if your partner was doing their job perfectly with those calls it is still only natural to have days where you feel the workload is ""unfair"". This can apply to both business partners when the responsibilities are different.",1281388838

It's also a drop in the ocean of energy demand. It solves nothing.<p>You only need to look as far as global rising energy consumption (especially China) and the supply/demand curve. Basic economics. This means the sustainable energy problem <i>needs</i> to be solved, and what better place to solve it than in California?<p>We need solutions without throwing the baby out with the bathwater. For example, make it easier for entrepreneurs and relieve the tax burden to encourage businesses. Provide an environment where technology (even green technology) can thrive. Create incentives for people to adopt more environmentally friendly approaches to living, etc. I think there are plenty of examples where sustainable living & and strong economic fundamentals can coexist.",1281387953

American's pay 28% on a larger number, so the amount of money per person is basically the same.<p>BTW - you're ignoring corporate taxes, which are a significant fraction of revenues.  They don't actually change the equivalence but they do increase the ""revenues per person-year"" number.<p>> nominal terms the US may be higher, but I don't really see that that proves anything.<p>Actually, it does.<p>> The main problem is of course that so much has to be paid for by the individual in the US that is efficiently taken care of by the state in Europe, so comparing tax rates misses a big part of the issue.<p>I'm not comparing tax rates.  I'm comparing tax revenues per person.<p>You're pointing out that western Europeans get more for the same amount of money.<p>Combining those two facts tells us that a tax dollar goes further in western Europe than it does in the US.<p>If the US govt wants to provide the same benefits, it either needs more money per person than European govts or it needs to take the relevant amount of money from its other expenditures.",1281387752
