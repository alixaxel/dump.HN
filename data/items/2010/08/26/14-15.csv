That's pretty low-level, though.<p>A keyboard is faster if you want to, say, ""jump to the head of the definition of the function body you're currently in and send it to be evaluated"", because a mouse just doesn't have enough buttons. With a keyboard, you can name operations. And then name new operations, grouping those names... (Why yes, I <i>do</i> use Emacs.) If I was using a mouse-and-menus for that stuff, the menus would stretch to the moon.<p>The next time somebody argues that a mouse is faster than a keyboard <i>for programming</i>, I'm going suggest they make their case solely by pointing at things and clicking their tongue.",1282834750

The essay? -That's not a scientific paper, it is speculation by a scientist.<p>You see, the problem is that the issue is too complex to wrap up like they did here. It is not sexy, but every component that could contribute to climate change requires careful data collection, analysis and objective consideration.<p>For example, the article seems to infer that solar panels would result in global warming because they are dark, and have a 15% efficiency converting sunlight to electricity. However, this does not take into consideration factors such as: estimates in increased efficiency as the solar panel technology matures, or (probably more important) the offset of warming effects of current fuel sources that solar panels will replace, particularly the burning of fossil fuels.<p>The real problem here, IMO, is that people walk away from an article like this thinking an issue such as global climate change can be understood and resolved simply by having the correct perspective. However, the reality is that the issue is much more complex, and that more important than our perspective, is what we can infer from data and the diligent analysis of that data by people that are motivated to understand the issue, and not to sell the discourse.",1282834634

I also don't use Xmonad out of pure Geekiness (though I started that way). I use it because I find it more comfortable.  I work at the same time with OSX, and while moving windows with the mouse is probably just as fast, it annoys me.<p>Now the reason why the keyboard is slower than the mouse may be sub-optimal short-cuts. For example, when editing, one very often needs to change lines, or otherwise navigate the text.  A sensible short-cut to support that could be alt + jkli (assuming a Qwerty layout). Then you don't have to leave the home row at all.  But if you have to use the actual arrows, it's slower, and that may make the mouse the better choice.",1282834061

Unfortunately, the WHO rankings of health care are not actually rankings of health care. They rank a weighted average of health (25%), health inequality (25%), responsiveness (12.5%), responsiveness inequality (12.5%), and financial inequality (25%).<p>Go read the actual report: <a href=""http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf</a><p>Only 37.5% of the ranking is even peripherally related to health care, namely health outcomes (measured by DALE, Disability Adjusted Life Expectancy) and responsiveness (how satisfied patients are). The US is #1 in responsiveness and #24 in DALE (4.5 years behind Japan at #1 and 0.5 years behind Germany at #22).<p>It's unclear how significant the gap in DALE is, since lifestyle and genetics strongly affect DALE. Fun fact: life expectancy for Japanese Americans is higher than for Japanese (84.5 in the US [1], 82.6 in Japan). Within the US, life expectancy varies from 44 (Lakota Men) to 86 (Chinese American Women), a gap of 42 years.<p>To actually rank health care, one would need to measure medical outcomes for specific medical diagnoses, adjusted for patient quality. E.g., it would need to answer questions like ""given a group of non-overweight white males aged 45-55 with prostate cancer, how many survive at least 5 years?"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlID=53"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&#3...</a>",1282834056

How could the man reverently known as “Dr Ozone” possibly endorse such a scheme? Wouldn’t the environmental damage outweigh the benefits?<p>Actually, no.

Furthermore, even if you lower global temperatures through stratosphere manipulation, there are many other scary unknowns in the field of climate change. Take ocean acidification for example:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification</a><p>The ocean is a substantial sink for atmospheric CO2. Our best guess is that 1/3 of the CO2 we produced is absorbed by the ocean. As the ocean absorbs CO2, however, the pH of ocean water drops. Unfortunately, we don't know how this will affect all of the different species of marine life that live in the ocean, but early experiments show that shellfish in particular do not tolerate more acidic waters very well. Furthermore, there is reason to believe that the ocean's CO2 absorbing capabilities will decrease as the pH decreases, leaving us with even more CO2 in the atmosphere.<p>Basically, there are a whole lot of unknowns in the whole debate, many of which could have unpleasant (to say the least) consequences. Brushing the entire field of climate science aside and declaring that all of our problems can be solved by pumping sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere is wildly irresponsible.",1282832394

For example, if you look at the method list of any of the collection classes it may seem extremely daunting but you soon realize that all the collection classes expose the same common interface and that beyond that there's a very logical hierarchy of subtypes with either different or increased functionality. Scala makes it easy to layer abstractions like this and to incur only the complexity you need to solve the problem at hand.<p>As you gain experience you will find yourself using the type system in more sophisticated ways to make more guarantees of the behavior and correctness of your code but Martin's stated goal in designing Scala was to build a language that could scale with the user and the application domain and I think he's succeeded.",1282832142

What if one of your newly minted engineers gets ambitious and goes on to become another Bill Gates? Economic inequality will be as bad as ever.</i><p>I find that assertion illogical. If I raise the income niveau of low wage workers, income inequality does go down. I don't have to keep the top down to reduce inequality, that's just nonsense.<p>The interesting question is where that money will come from. Increasing lower wages take away from the income of the companies they work for (those people are usually not self employed). So what we will see is a little less income for large companies and their owners, who form the very top incomes anyway. Also, note that the incomes of the top 1% do not really affect the median (and also the average, to a lesser degree) income all that much.<p>I don't see how that is fundamentally keeping innovation from happening. Founding the next MS might be a little less profitable, but I don't think it'd have kept Bill Gates from doing what he did if he had a billion less by now. Also, Microsoft is quite the counter example: they pay their workers comparatively high wages.<p>As for the practical effects: I think we can see that Europe (and in particular the more egalitarian Northern Europe) does not necessarily fit his description of a poor country only offering raw materials and cheap labour. There is also lots of innovation happening, not necessarily in IT, but in other sectors (machine engineering, medical, the whole car industry, ...).<p>So, I think the theoretical point is illogical, and practice shows the effects it predicts do not happen.
