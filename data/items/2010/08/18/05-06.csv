1613369,comment,1612101,1612101,0,0,crazydiamond,,,"During moments of danger, the mind (which is normally active and thinking all kinds of thought of past and future) stops. Thus there is a silent alertness, a clarity of vision and other senses. For such a person, it is <i>as though</i> time has stopped.<p>This is something which is quite common in the meditative practice of remaining in the present moment. Eckhart Tolle talks about this in ""The Power of Now"". The Buddhists (incl Zen) talk about being in the Now, too.<p>No, the brain does not speed up, and no, you do not start remembering each and every detail of what you see and hear. However, the clarity of the senses is remarkable. Its like one has been looking from behind a dirty window all one's life, and now someone has washed the window.",1282111080

I work in an offline sector that is not as carefree with information as Silicon Valley software firms tend to be.<p>My company is actually far more capital intensive (think plumbing or dentistry) than a software firm would be. We had non-trivial fixed startup costs and our costs tend to scale up (slightly sublinearly) alongside our growth, but we still managed to bootstrap via consulting, one-off jobs, favors, and creativity. I often puzzle at why a software startup which has far lower costs than our firm would want to take outside capital.<p>From an entrepreneur's perspective, capital is much more suited to a firm like ours than a software company - when I look at the margins in the software industry and the small amounts of money angels invest in exchange for the equity, I think they must be laughing all the way to the bank.",1282109987

So hitting up all the standard blogs once your app is well reviewed and polished up will generally get you a mention.<p>From there it is pretty much organic, we did a bit of tweaking of our application name based on what we think common searches are 'news', 'rss'.<p>People like trials, though it is probably mostly relevant for an app like NewsRoom, where the real utility comes from using it for days.  For smaller games I'm not sure it makes much of a difference, though that it is surely true that the Android market is especially harsh to the amusing for 10 minutes kind of games that sell quite a bit in the App store for 99c.  Those apps make nothing on Android, as people return them within the 24 hour window.<p>The trial was also useful for international customers, as we allow people to get an unlock key from our website.  Paid apps aren't available in a lot of countries that the Android marketplace lives, so this lets those users who want the full version have a way to buy it.  We don't get a ton of sales that way, but a few a day.<p>I don't think the website helps much at all, though the video might help give people an idea of how it works.  We consider those to just be checkboxes for getting blog coverage, most purchasing decisions are made on the phone I think, where people aren't googling the app first.",1282109724

1613327,comment,1613011,1613286,0,0,gamble,,,"The only <i>fact</i> here is that Google very quickly switched from a whole-hearted support of net neutrality to, at best, a compromised position endorsed by Verizon, a company with a long history of outright opposition to net neutrality and one that has significant leverage over Google thanks to Droid sales. Their change of heart occurred very shortly after Android began to be perceived as a success and after rumors of a Verizon iPhone.<p>Fundamentally, this is an issue of trust. The deal Google is proposing creates significant wiggle room for the landline carriers, and asks us to trust that the issue will be revisited for wireless carriers somewhere down the road, even though an entrenched discriminatory regime will be much more difficult to dislodge if it becomes a reality on the ground. There is a fairly strong net neutrality movement today, even without Google, an apparently sympathetic FCC, and a Democratic Congress capable of passing a net neutrality bill. There will not be a better opportunity to legislate net neutrality for <i>years</i>, given the likely results of the upcoming midterms. Google is asking us to trust them and wait, when waiting will almost certainly put the enemies of net neutrality into a stronger position.<p>Personally, I don't see a lot of reason to trust Google on this issue. They are like a lifelong Republican who suddenly discovered the attraction of left-wing politics after losing his primary and joining the Democrats.",1282108860
