It is unrealistic to expect everyone to get along and the world to be great without some abiding laws that those involved agree upon.  The fact that things have been luckily good so far is really not the whole story.  These carriers are itching to reduce network load, and without any rules they could begin making decisions to lower costs without directly harming customers. This could be very toxic for what the Internet stands for, and while it's unthinkable today it is possible in the future.",1282107376

1613297,comment,1612910,1612910,0,0,dasil003,,,"This is a paranoid worldview.  Of course angels operate in self-interest, just as you should.  It's unfortunate if you get taken advantage of by an unscrupulous investor, but it doesn't make angels evil in general.<p>At the end of the day angels (and VCs) are handing you wads of cash to build your company.  This might save you years of scrimping and saving just to have enough savings to bootstrap for a year or two (and forget about it if you have any serious capital expenditures).  Should they just be cutting 5, 6, 7 figure checks out of the goodness of their heart?  No, it's your responsibility as an entrepreneur to know what you are getting into.  And I should add that that is much easier today with the wealth of good solid information about term sheets, etc, that is available today on the web for free compared to as recently as 10 years ago where you basically had to learn things the old-fashioned way (ie. personal connections, apprenticeships).<p>That said, yeah, bootstrapping is better if you can possibly do it, because you take all the risk and you reap all the rewards.  But to say that the very idea of aspiring to build a large company is koolaid sold by angels is ridiculous.  It's the fundamental silicon valley dream; painted by history, not some snake oil pitch.",1282107320

1613293,comment,1609207,1609207,0,0,ycweb,,,"A lot of the SSL vs. SSH discussion on here is just demonstrating the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for authentication.<p>The point of tcpcrypt is to get the best security possible under any setting, so it can be used with both SSL- and SSH-like settings.  See slide 5 of the talk on the web site:<p><a href=""http://tcpcrypt.org/tcpcrypt-slides.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tcpcrypt.org/tcpcrypt-slides.pdf</a><p>One thing I haven't seen discussed yet is that fact that come October, the EKE patent is going to expire, which means that all of a sudden it's going to be legal to do strong authentication using only human-chosen passwords.  Strong password authentication is desperately needed, because people overwhelmingly both chose week passwords and don't think carefully about where they send those passwords.<p>Somewhat independent of tcpcrypt, section 4.3 of the tcpcrypt Usenix paper suggests a nice and simple secure password-authentication protocol.  Deploying such a protocol would make a huge difference, except... what are you authenticating?  You can prove possession of a password, but this doesn't actually protect you unless the authentication is tied to session traffic, and you are authenticating communication endpoints.  SSL, IPSec, and even SSH don't provide adequate hooks for doing this (though SSH would be easier to retrofit than the other two).  Tcpcrypt does.<p>So the way to view this is that in the absence of authentication, tcpcrypt will be vulnerable to MITM.  But as soon as you go to authenticate yourself to a server (by typing a password or verifying a certificate), the authentication will fail, and the MITM will no longer be able to deceive the user.",1282107273

When I go high-speed go karting, my brain needs to work incredibly fast to keep up with every little thing going on. In between sessions, if I play games on my iPhone, it is literally like the game is being played in slow motion. Alternatively, if I wake up in the morning all drowsy and I play those same games, it's as if the games are in fast forward and I can't keep up.

For example, when you're having a meeting about integrating two systems and a fifty pound animal is moving about under the table.

A good idea (validated market?) with poor execution is likely to produce a poor product. Conversely a bad idea (no market?) with outstanding execution is also likely to produce a poor product.

One thing is for certain that we can all agree on: a great idea with great execution produces a great product.<p>As far as sharing ideas go, I tend to only share with people I know. I violently agree that collecting feedback on an idea is immensely valuable, but there are many ways to go about doing so. Posting them into Hacker News is probably the last thing I'd do, for two reasons:<p>1) Unless I'm building a super niche product targeted at developers/entrepreneurs/designers, then Hacker News is not the place I should be collecting feedback.<p>2) If anywhere there exists a capable group of ""idea executers"", it's here.

1613249,comment,1612910,1612910,0,0,grellas,,,"I think this piece takes an unbalanced view of angel investors by treating them as some sort of enemy.<p>Successful startups can come in many shapes and sizes, though some highly respected people like Steve Blank take the view that what you are building cannot legitimately be called a startup unless it shoots for the moon and seeks to massively scale. I think that Mr. Blank's view reflects VC thinking, and it is a legitimate point of view from that perspective. All small-scale businesses, in that view, are and will always remain ""small businesses"" unless they aim for massive growth and for a transformative commercial outcome, in which case they are true startups. High risk. High reward. High failure rate. But, in this view, you are not doing a true startup unless that is the view in mind. Of course, any such startup will necessarily require large infusions of capital in order to aim that high, and this assumes it will be VC-funded.<p>I strongly disagree with this VC-only view of startups (that is, with its being the only legitimate form of startup), and the founders I have worked with for years have tended to reject it as a working approach to their startups. These sorts of founders have always valued the independence of keeping control of their ventures and of seeking to build it to the optimum level for their needs and then either selling it or keeping it as a longer-term business that is solidly profitable. Even in the days when it took far more capital than it does today to launch the prototypical Silicon Valley startup, it is <i>amazing</i> how many such independent startups managed to thrive and flourish in the nooks and crannies of the startup world. The founders behind such companies had all the exceptional qualities that solid entrepreneurs need in order to conceive winning ideas and to execute them well.<p>In today's environment, such independent startups are thriving and flourishing all the more as the capital needs for launching a startup have sharply declined. The independence of the entrepreneur, and the corresponding power of control over one's own company, is stronger than ever. This is solidly confirmed today in Silicon Valley and elsewhere as early-stage startups are proliferating while VC-backed ventures have been comparatively stagnant. In this sense, it is perhaps a new era for startups. Those that want to build their company independently, or even those who ultimately plan to seek significant outside funding but wish to defer such funding until they can build solid value and minimize dilution, are in the ascendancy and this trend is possibly a permanent one.<p>All that said, the founders who fit in this ""independent"" category have <i>never</i>, in my experience, seen investors as the enemy. There is an antipathy to VCs who propose shark-like terms but never to quality VCs who can legitimately take the company to the next level. Maybe they don't want to take the risks associated with such a course, but the founders see it as one legitimate option to consider - to consider and reject for many of them, perhaps, but to consider nonetheless. They are not harmed by the presence of such VCs but rather helped in that their choices are broadened for situations where such a path might become attractive to them.<p>Whatever may be said of VCs, though, there has never been any general antipathy to angels as a potential investment source. Angel investors have always come in all varieties. Many are successful entrepreneurs in their own right and they not only can invest money into a promising venture but also other talent and expertise that can help guide the venture. I have seen such situations firsthand, over and over again, where such contributions have proven invaluable to the startups involved and much appreciated by the founders. It is precisely by this means that founders often can raise the comparatively modest amounts of capital that would be too much for the founders themselves to risk but that are essential to building the venture to the point where it can become commercially feasible. Such companies have nowhere to go without such capital, and the angels are there to supply it on terms that are often reasonable and very much in the interests of not only the angels but of the founders also. To categorically write off this sort of investment as coming from some congenitally hostile source that must be resisted at all costs by founders is a mistake. Some ventures, of course, will want strictly to self-fund. But not all do. Indeed, from my experience with having worked with countless founders, I would say that <i>most</i> do not want to limit themselves strictly to self-funding because they themselves see that pure self-funding will not enable them to realize their goals for their venture.<p>I am not saying that all angel investments are good or that all angel investors are benign. It is a shark's world out there and, whenever entrepreneurs are taking investment money, they need to watch their backs. But to dismiss angels as a category is to dismiss the idea that founders should have a broad range of choices before them in seeking to build their companies, and such a categorical dismissal is a serious mistake for most ventures. It is like saying that, because there are risks in a certain direction, I as an entrepreneur will never walk that path even while my competitors keep that option open for themselves and perhaps use it to outrun my venture through needed capital infusions that can often take a company to a better level.<p>My advice to founders: don't be gullible in allowing yourselves to be cowed into taking in investment money for no good purpose other than to brag about being a legitimate startup (this is good advice from this piece); but don't become so narrow-minded about investment options that you box yourselves into a strictly self-funded venture in cases where that may not be in your startup's best interests.<p>In other words, forget categorical rules in this area. Consider angels and their investments in light of the bona fide needs of your venture and, if they can meet those needs, then by all means avail yourselves of the value they offer (and, yes, do it on the best terms you can and watch out for the vultures). If they don't meet your needs, and you see more value in building a long-term profitable company without looking to be acquired, then by all means avoid investments that will only complicate your company and your life.<p>But by all means keep a balanced view of this or you will only arbitrarily limit your own legitimate options for building a successful venture.",1282105339

Most of the inconvenience comes when writing functions - things like having to name list parameters ""lst."" The way Common Lisp gets around the variable capture problem is to forbid the rebinding of special forms, functions, and macros defined in the standard.* This is an ugly hack that forces early binding, and obviously does nothing to prevent capture of user-defined functions.<p>The Scheme wiki has a good article on hygiene: <a href=""http://community.schemewiki.org/?hygiene-versus-gensym"" rel=""nofollow"">http://community.schemewiki.org/?hygiene-versus-gensym</a><p>* - This wasn't done for the sake of macros. The rationale behind the decision as I heard it is to prevent the hypothetical scenario of some standard function like cdr that's called inside the garbage collector or allocator from being rebound to something that tries to allocate memory and crashes the gc or sends the allocator into an infinite loop. I don't really buy it; it's easy enough to prevent these types of scenarios.",1282104746

The semi-official answer seems to be to use a WYSIWYG editor, which seems to be the solution XML proponents take to any syntax problem. ;-) For example, you can export to MathML from OpenOffice's equation editor.<p>2. If your goal is just to display math in webpages, there are some .js libraries that replace MathML's concrete syntax inline: you write a different syntax directly in your markup, and then it's converted at load time to MathML for browser rendering.
