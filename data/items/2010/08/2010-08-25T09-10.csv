The documentation is insufficient and code samples (at least the Java one) are horrible, but it gives you the ability to accept credit card payments (without requiring the user to sign up for a Paypal account). Unfortunately that's not the case for Google Checkout, which requires a google account.<p>My next step is Braintree <a href=""http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.braintreepaymentsolutions.com/</a>
Its API is much better, and it's more flexible than Paypal. It has some fixed costs, but nothing too bad if you are serious about your business.",1282730305

I'd like to see Sonatype's OSS repo become the obvious choice (they certainly know what they're doing in that arena, and have a privileged position vis á vis their maintenance of central, and probably what will replace java.net and kenai), but they're not making it as easy as it should be.  See my reply to Brian Fox's comment on the original post.<p>As for whether you should cut your losses or not -- that's a tougher question.  I'd love to see a properly competitive market for repo hosting services.  On the other hand, I wouldn't want to try to compete with a company that quite literally sets technical standards based on how their products are implemented.  Sorry, that's not much help, is it? :-/",1282730193

A body that doesn't have a force applied to it follows a straight line, but in curved spacetime, a straight line might correspond to, for example, a planet's orbit.<p>This is, however, just another level of description, and you could ask why this happens. We don't yet know the next level of description. It is hoped that some future theory will reconcile quantum mechanics with general relativity and that might give us some further insight into ""why"".<p>It's worth pointing out that any theory isn't necessarily a description of how something actually works. It is merely a model that fits experimental results. Often a model can be reformulated using different, but ultimately equivalent, mathematical language and it would give the same predictions.<p>In a similar vein, you could ask why objects continue to move in a straight line if no force is applied (Newton's first law).

Don't care about reading barcodes? Tough, because you can't read the later chapter on Monads unless you grit your teeth.<p>The authors spend an awful lot of time showing you the wrong way (i.e. non-idiomatic) to do something and revealing with a flourish the Haskell way. Really you ought to just skip the first half of each chapter and not waste time learning techniques that you have to unlearn later. But you can't, because of the way it's all so intertwined.<p>Latest peeve - sometimes they talk about wrapping and unwrapping values, which is fine. But sometimes they talk about ""peeling"". What's that? Is it just another word for unwrap? Is it some special Haskell term? I don't know, I'm a beginner!<p>On page 369 of my copy there's code that fails to compile and in the session output in the book there are actual error messages from the compiler - but the following paragraph of text talks about it as if it was giving the ""correct"" results...<p>The only reason to read RWH is that there's a dearth of Haskell books so you make the best of it - but compared to say Learning Python or Programming Python also from O'Reilly it's really quite poor.",1282729718

Also, the decline is slowing, and the market is fairly saturated.<p>The thing that killed film cameras is that digital cameras just work better and have at least one killer feature -- Instant review. That is a massive advantage for consumer and professional alike. Once the disadvantages were moore's lawed away -- quality for professionals and price, size and printing for consumers -- film could not stand.<p>There is no killer feature with download music. I can get it faster, but so what? It might grasp the fashion markets, but not everyone needs <i>music now</i>. It has added no killer feature and it's not even cheaper.

And they can play their CD's everywhere, and they can rip them and put them on portable devices, and they can display them in their living rooms.<p>Newspapers - physicality is nice, but I can well see them disappearing, because digital news will be more convenient, cheaper and more up-to-date. The winners will be the digital newspapers that preserve or enhance the paper reading experience, which might not mean having reporters and so on, but will mean selecting and presenting information in a way people value (in particular, mirroring the reader's values.

The truth is that femininity and masculinity are a continuous spectrum of variation and almost all such statements tend to prescribe something or the other. To tell you the truth I fulfill the stereotype you are proposing in quite a few ways, but most women don't. Just as most males aren't the fist beating cavemen they are made out to be. Why can't we let people just be?<p>Why do we need to box them into little boxes, so that they conveniently fit into our tiny little realities? Why do we need to make statements like, it's tough to be a man/woman/american/indian/african american/whatever category you can come up with?<p>It is shocking just how ingrained this is into our consciousness and even though I can articulate it I still can't get it out of my head. I still box people in.<p>Look earlier women who had it in them to become scientists were told explicitly that they should become housewives. Take a look at Joan Feynman; her thesis adviser told her the only geometry she needed to learn was the geometry of the cobwebs she should be cleaning at home. Imagine what would have happened if she would have given up. We would have lost a great mind to something as abhorrent as prejudice.<p>The same lesson still exists. Let the kid be. Let her grow up into who <i>she</i> wants to be. Not who society thinks she <i>ought</i> to be. She will be depressed if you take the fight out of her so that you can squeeze her into a housewife. She will be depressed if you force her onto a stage against her wish. She will be depressed in all the cases where you push her into becoming something she isn't. I think that this is what you were trying to say.<p>On the other hand, what boggles my mind is why aren't more males taught to exit their boxes and give a hand in raising their kids. Raising a human being isn't a full time job if it's a shared responsibility and I think expecting anything other than that is just another small box.",1282727202
