1584409,comment,1581696,1584053,0,0,jsolson,,,"I'm not sure this is actually going to be a useful explanation, but I'll give it a go.<p>One problem has to do with rotational symmetry. The selection of a juggling pin is perhaps not the best example, but let us assume for now that the juggling pin has a dot somewhere on its surface that ensures it is not rotationally symmetric about any axis. If you are only concerned with the with orienting a body subject to symmetry you can sometimes do better (for example, a perfectly uniform sphere would only require three components), but the general case requires six components.<p>Your approach of pinning two atoms in the pin effectively specifies an axis. Yes, it would accurately position and constrain two points on the pin. Those two points form a line. Consider what happens if I now rotate the rest of the atoms in the pin around that line. I have not changed the representation in your coordinate system, because I've kept the two atoms you specified fixed, but I have changed the orientation of the pin for an external observer. If, on the other hand, you constrained another atom that was not colinear with the first two, I would no longer be allowed this freedom of rotation. The system would be said to be fully constrained.<p>To put this into concrete terms with our pin, let's assume the two atoms I picked were the center of the top and the center of the bottom. Because the pin is symmetric about this axis, with five numbers I can specify the orientation of the pin sufficiently to juggle it, but what about the dot I mentioned before? By rotating the pin about this principal axis I could change the position of the dot without changing the coordinates of the pin.<p>Stated more simply: if I tell you the position of the center of the earth and my location in terms of latitude and longitude, you can locate me precisely, but you can't tell whether I'm looking north or south.<p>Also, you can only encode a (countably infinite) subset of the reals by interleaving digits. Consider the set of irrational numbers. Any scheme you provide that tries to reduce the dimension of a vector of n reals into n-1 will face the same problem: you cannot project from a space who's components are made up of members uncountably infinite sets into a space of lower dimension without losing information.",1281218045

This goes double for languages with very simplistic type systems, such as C#, as they have all of the disadvantages of a static type system with few of its advantages.<p>Statically typed languages tend to lack good REPLs, a tool I consider indispensable. I'm unaware of any statically typed language that has something as complete and integrated as SLIME, for instance. Even a properly setup IRB or IPython don't seem to have anything that matches them in the statically typed world.<p>Another problem is that statically typed languages can have long compile cycles. One C# project I worked on made heavy use of PostSharp, the use of which slowed the compile time to nearly a minute. Additionally, whilst Visual Studio updated the ASP templates in real time, there didn't seem to be a way to reload new DLLs without restarting the development server.<p>Conversely, when I'm hacking in Clojure, updating the entire system can be done without restarting the server, and takes a fraction of a second.<p>Macros, too, I guess are easier with dynamic typing.

Probability depends on distribution and if you don't know the distribution it cannot be calculated. Fact that it cannot be calculated does not entitle you to assuming its 1/2.<p>If you have problem with that imagine stack of cards. You and your opponent pick one card. Whoever picks higher card wins. Until you see your card you have 1/2 probability of winning. But after you see you just picked 3 you see your probability of winning sharply changes (depending on what cards are left in the stack).<p>Ad.2\nWhen you don't open your envelope you must treat amount in it (A) as random variable. Then all I wrote in post above applies.<p>It doesn't matter that you did not looked into an envelope. Because whether you got higher or lower amount is significant and you don't know which occurred you must split your reasoning and consider both cases. But upon splitting you must remember that condition you assume for each given branch of your reasoning must be taken into account. You can do this by pruning your random variable A with the appropriate condition and that influences its expected value. So by all means you can sum up expected values but not before appropriately adjusting them with the conditions you assumed for branches of your reasoning.<p>Consider solving equation x^2 + yx +1 = 0 While solving your may split you reasoning to three cases depending on whether y^2-4 is larger, smaller or equal to zero (even though you don't know what is the value of y). But when summing up solution you must remember that you assumed something about y in your branches so for the x you've found y can no longer be any real number.",1281214958

Purely along the axis of dynamic-or-not you can make a bunch of arguments, speculate that a statically typed language can meet any particular feature or benefit a dynamic language has, etc.; but those statically typed languages have had an opportunity cost, and the opportunity they missed wasn't one of types but of all the other aspects of software development -- because in any community of practitioners people will hit a wall, it's just <i>what</i> wall, and how they get past it.
