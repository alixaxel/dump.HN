1633376,comment,1631797,1632056,0,0,snorkel,,,"My take: Monads were created to allow pure functional languages like Haskell to have side effects, particularly input and output, without breaking the pure functional syntax. Monads have many other uses, but state and side effects was the original raison d'etre.<p>Haskell, for example, is a pure functional language that doesn't have an explicit syntax for side effects or state. But a language without any side effects can not do anything more useful than heat up the CPU: you have to have input and output, which means allowing for side effects. The Monad was the most elegant solution presented for that issue.<p>In code a monad looks like a function which has more outputs then inputs, and the compiler takes care of channeling the additional input and output between functions adjacent to the monad in way that doesn't break the functional syntax. This differential between function inputs and outputs allows for some interesting use cases and thus the many varieties of monads. Also the compiler makes sure the order lazy evaluations dependent on monads happen in the right order so that you're not trying to parse file contents before you've read the file (because in a pure functional language, like cells in a spreadsheet, everything is intended to be evaluated all at once).",1282755087

Based on your next sentence, I think I see where the misunderstanding lies.<p>You state that the scientific method is about making conclusions on observable data and then discarding them when new data arrives.  This is incomplete.  Good scientific experiments depend on variables under your control.  In layman's terms, you must be in control of everything, know what is going on, and test the specific thing, the one variable you are not controlling.  And there are varying degrees of variables involved in the scientific method, along with their complexities.<p>Now, just in case we already agree and that your statement assumed all that, then I would find fault with the theory that you have sufficient ""observable data"".  That is the entire problem.  We already know what you are missing.  You need the entire set of experiences that someone has stored in their brain.  You need to know the state of the body as well, so that you can identify additional influences (such as a headache, making for hastier decisions based on more recent experiences).  You need instruments that can provide you this data, and then you can run your statistics and learn something.<p>And, of course, you need to have an understanding of the influences of the various experiences and body issues; so you have many studies to run before you get to tackle the issue of free will.  Fortunately, we have a LOT of these studies already (and a lot more to do).  See psychology, etc.<p>> could you elaborate on an appropriate instrument to appropriately observe and identify him in a way that is reproducible for others to also observe objectively?<p>I am in full agreement with your criteria.  Maybe one day we will have the technology to do this.  Right now, I cannot imagine what the instrument is.  I would propose that another god could observe God, or the context of the universe around God could be used in some fashion or produce an instrument to observe God.  Maybe in God's metauniverse, there are entities analogous to our rocks, plants, and so forth that could be used to observe His passing.<p>Taking another approach, this might be akin to gut bacteria trying to prove the existence of Earth.  If existence as we know it is an extension of God, how can we identify God?  (Trying to avoid the obvious circular argument.)<p>Anyway, this is all freshman philosophy stuff.  Good fodder for coffee talk.  Suffice it to say that when we are talking science, we are indeed talking about using tools that ""appropriately observe and identify him in a way that is reproducible for others to also observe objectively"".  Just because we do not have those tools does not invalidate truths about our universe.  We did not have a yardstick until the 10th century.  We have come a long way since then, and we have a long way to go.",1282753928

That gives a state tax burden of roughly US$1610 per person in constant 2010 dollars.  The 2009–2010 tax burden is US$3200 per person.<p>Therefore, at least over the 1966 to 2010 time period, if these figures are correct, then far from being the victims of an ""enormous cheat"" or ""terrible swindle"" in which state taxes were cut to the bone by a generation supported by state taxes, necessitating massive cuts in public services, state taxes per capita have nearly doubled during that period, adjusted for inflation using the CPI.<p>Some other possibilities were suggested in the comment thread:<p>• Maybe the CPI isn't the right deflator to use, because most of the state's revenues go to education and health care, not vegetables and beef, and these services have inflated in price much faster than the CPI. However, this doesn't rescue the ""terrible swindle ... walking away from their obligations"" claim.<p>• Maybe O'Hare isn't referring to public services as they were provided in California during the 1960s but during some earlier period, such as the 1940s. Prof. O'Hare, can you clarify your claims?<p>• Maybe most of the tax money is being wasted on unproductive things such as prisons, managers and administrators, or legislators, rather than being spent on productive things like public education and road maintenance. In this case, there is a ""terrible swindle"", but the perpetrators are not the voters or the taxpayers but the employees of the government.<p>• Maybe much of the high standard of living some decades ago was paid for by externalities. For example, power plants might have been less expensive to operate before the EPA was established, K-12 schools might have had higher quality when economic opportunities for women outside of them were sharply limited by institutionalized sexism, US military power might have kept the prices of many raw materials artificially low, and unsustainable depletion of fossil fuels might have kept the prices of energy and asphalt artificially low. As some of these externalities have been internalized, taxes would have to rise.  For example, to attract the best and brightest women to teaching in K-12 education, the way we used to in the 1950s and 1960s, we'd either need a massive propaganda campaign about the nobility and importance of teachers (comparable to the one we have about soldiers), or we'd need to pay top K-12 teachers US$200 000 a year or more — with a credible commitment to continue to do so for half a century into the future.<p>So, on the face of it, the numbers don't seem to add up to support your claim. Can you help out with that?<p>Other comments related to this question include <a href=""http://www.samefacts.com/2010/08/education-policy/a-letter-to-my-students/comment-page-1/#comment-45779"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.samefacts.com/2010/08/education-policy/a-letter-t...</a> which seems to not be using the same facts as the commenter whose figures I quoted above.<p>The California Budget Project's summary gives a lower number of US$86.8 billion for 2009-10, which is still much larger than the inflation-adjusted per-capita 1966 number: <a href=""http://cbp.org/pdfs/2010/CaliforniaBudgetBites/100329_budgetmyths.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cbp.org/pdfs/2010/CaliforniaBudgetBites/100329_budget...</a>",1282753580

This easily acknowledges that my situation, my options and my choices all have causes (are not ""free"" in a strict sense), but still gives me the ability to change my world, by deliberately chosing the actions I prefer to take from the spectrum of those available under my current constrains.
