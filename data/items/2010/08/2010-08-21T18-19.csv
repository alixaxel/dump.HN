You can have a conspiracy to overthrow some government, you can also have a wacky belief into something which has no base in any reasonable doubt to believe. The latter being the way the word conspiracy theory is used.<p>There is however no conspiracy here. A national government, the most mighty power in any nation, seeks to arrest a man and makes such intention known to the entire world. A man this is about who we have read only recently by certain people asked to be arrested in defiance of international law and without having committed a crime, a man who was accused by the US government for having blood on his hands for leaking information which apparently has nothing new to say, a man of whom people are speculating as to how the government will be ridden of, the preferred choice of the speculators being to kill him.<p>A conspiracy is something which has no base in reality. This is beyond that. In this instance there is no base to not believe in the ""conspiracy"".<p>Also, it is telling that only hours after an article was submitted here which did not make the front page of HN, an article by CNN on a blog on CNN, asked whether this is a smear campaign that the Associated Press reports that the warrant is withdrawn.<p>I for one have no reasonable doubt. I wish not to engage in any games of thought. I would rather see this for what it is, an absolute disgrace by a democratic government who is conspiring against its people and their will.",1282417081

It's too new of an art form, really, just a couple decades vs around 100 years of movies (thousands if you include plays) vs thousands for books.

Better than the best book?  No.  Though I've never found movies particularly immersive, so I do side with games there.<p>And, ultimately, at its most pared down, a game can be essentially identical to either a movie or a book, because there's an easy reduction to either (no feedback = movie, no feedback + no visual aside from text = book).  That Ebert claims that something which <i>can</i> be either <i>cannot</i> be art like either must be hinging around the feedback, which is what many people get hooked on.

The backrub paper (<a href=""http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html</a>) is also great, and has been a personal inspiration, however that information pre-dates the founding of Google as a corporation, and the search algorithm been developed in complete secrecy for more than a decade since then.<p>There are more than 200 other signals used to determine relevance, and PageRank is only one of them (<a href=""http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html</a>).  The others are completely secret as far as I can tell, and there's no indication what weight is given to PageRank now.<p>I'm not attributing malice to the secrecy, but there's no way to know what biases are embodied in the algorithm, and I think that's a serious concern.<p>I don't think it's unreasonable to claim that Google is as important as the press now as a source of public information.  The biases of the press are very much a concern for society, so I think we should be equally concerned about the potential for bias in the search results.<p>As for Gruber, my guess is that he feels that the discourse in the tech press/blogosphere has demonized Apple heavily for the closed nature of the App store, whereas Google is praised for its 'openness' with much less examination of what that really means.<p>Personally I think that Gruber can be childish about this, but I think both companies deserve rational criticism.<p>I'm more worried about Google than I am about Apple because their secrecy is about how public information is prioritized.<p>I do have similar concerns about how Apple prioritizes applications in the App Store, but for now that seems a lot less important than how Google prioritizes websites.",1282414770
