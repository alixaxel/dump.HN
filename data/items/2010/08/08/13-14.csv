These algorithms are black boxes whose behaviour is very poorly modeled by the usual tuple of contiguous transfer rate / random 4K access rate / seek time etc. measured by artificial benchmarks. You don't know how the drive is really going to react until you hit it with the mix of operations that match your real workload.<p>Personally I've found the Intel SSDs to work best at the primary use case, speeding up small random reads, even when other drives have appeared to exceed them in random read. Bulk contiguous transfer looks really impressive, but mechanical drives with high data density are pretty fast at that too. What you really need the SSD for is random reads, and ensure that the random read performance holds up when mixed with other use patterns.",1281274539

If you're hiring you want to filter down the applications to a measurable amount, and one of the best ways to do this is by seeing if they've done something in the past which requires high ability.<p>In CS this could be having gained entry to MIT or having worked at Google. In these cases you have an institute that you respect saying ""we've evaluated this person previously and they've met our high standards"". So regardless of the fact that went to MIT or worked at Google, the very fact they got in conveys valuable information to the future employer.<p>I'm willing to bet that if you applied to hundred companies with two applications both otherwise identical but one having a MIT degree and one having a state college degree, the MIT degree application would get you far more interviews.<p>Also there's the fact that schools are different. There are plenty of college which are essentially ""java schools"" which have very minimal coverage of CS beyond programming, which is significantly different from what you'd get at somewhere like MIT. The same applies to MBA schools, but even more, there's no standardised curriculum and the quality of the teachers varies far more, you could be taught by the person who invented in industry the business practices he teaches, or alternatively by a teacher with no real interest in the subject and no industry experience.<p>There's a lot that can be learnt from books, but there's a huge amount of knowledge that can only be learnt from people with industry experience and that's a rare thing.",1281274293
