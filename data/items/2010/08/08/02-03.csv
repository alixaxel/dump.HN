When you (not you specifically, in general) design a database, do you use types, do you mark a field as int or let everything be a string? Yes, when you code you can make sure to only put ""integers"" (as string) in that field and everything will work. Maybe it's not the perfect analogy, but I think it touches an important point.

SIPs provide isolation and failure containment at far less performance cost than hardware mechanisms, so they can be used in more places than conventional processes.</i><p>This is the (IMO) really interesting part, and is why I've decided I like instead of dislike type-safe virtual machines on general principle.<p><i>The Singularity architecture avoids many of these problems. For example, SIPs are sealed processes that prohibit shared memory, in-process code generation, and dynamic code loading. A process that wishes to invoke an extension starts the extension code running in a separate SIP.</i><p>dlopen() cannot exist. I'm not sure how/if you could write your own JIT (say, for something like... a JVM?), you'd probably have to fully pre-compile down to MSIL. This is one of those ""nice in theory"" things that I suspect won't work so well in the real world, because the extra development overhead probably isn't worth the added safety in most circumstances.<p>Having this be a flag that a given process can declare in its manifest might be good, having an <i>optional</i> startup parameter to the OS to require it for all processes might also make sense. Making it universally mandatory seems questionable.<p><i>With only two exceptions, an ABI call affects only the state of its calling process. The two exceptions alter the state of a child process before or after it executes,\nbut not during execution. The first is a call to create a child process, which specifies the code loaded for the child before it begins execution. The second is a call to stop a child process, which reclaims its resources after all threads cease execution. State isolation ensures that a Singularity process has sole control over its state.</i> (From <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=52716"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=5271...</a> )<p>In sounds like it's an object-capability system, which is very cool.",1281234812

I think I didn't explain properly (or I misunderstood your point).<p>Lets say you have a method the sole task of which is to call call .read() on its argument and return a single char.<p>char readch(obj) { return obj.read(); }<p>Now, since I have not declared any explicit type for obj, the compiler would generate code like this:<p><pre><code>    interface readch_obj {\n        char read();\n    }\n    \n    char readch(readch_obj obj) { return obj.read(); }\n</code></pre>\nSo the function basically takes in an interface readch_obj which defines a single read() method that returns a char.<p>Now, the trick is, the compiler can intelligently recognize that the FILE object has a method with the required signature (char read() ) and that the STRINGIO object also has a method with that required signature and so the compiler automatically tags the FILE object and STRINGIO object as implementing obj_readch and so, either of those objects can be passed in as an argument to readch().<p>Note: I'm not saying this is how the Go compiler actually works but this is the basic concept from what I understood.<p>The language doesn't need to allow for adding methods at runtime for this to work.<p>If the language did have the scaffolding needed to add methods at runtime, then yes, this technique wouldn't work and thats probably the fundamental difference between ducktyping and this (structural subtyping? not sure what it's called).",1281234353

They're pretty difficult to kill with just your hand, and they will mob you pretty quickly. So you essentially have to construct a safety fort to live. People solve this problem in pretty elaborate ways sometimes.<p>One of the most interesting aspects of the game is how subtle the world around you is.
