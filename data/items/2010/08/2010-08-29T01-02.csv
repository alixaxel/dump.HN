Globalization is usually referred to as 国际化, ""international"" + suffix to mean ""evolving to something""; ie - becoming international.<p>So yes, this is one of the ways whereby when Chinese is succinct, it's really succinct, hence loved by many of the older generation. But since Chinese doesn't share the recursive and context-free grammatical structure of English, and because tense isn't explicit, you lose some flexibility.<p>Eg: Instant Messaging can be shortened to IM, and can be turned into a transitive form but adding 'ing' to form IMing.<p>And of course, I'm confident that a language affects the way you think, as well as the memes that can be passed around. Best example, the word LOLcat and the associated lulz could never have evolved in the Chinese language.<p>Something else could have evolved perhaps, but different things for sure, with a different focus.<p>Should probably also bring up the fact that acronyms are near impossible in Chinese, at least in it's strict sense. I like Japanese for the fact that both the language and the culture is willing to evolve.<p>Or put slightly differently, Chinese is kinda like Java. Japanese is more Clojure-ish, with the ability to abandon formal declarations (arigato + many trailing speech placeholders) yet retain the good parts of its core.",1283046954

The Appel book is also very good, and contains some stuff about functional and logic languages that are generally missing from most compiler texts. If you're an enthusiast, but not in it to build a compiler, I really enjoy Programming Language Pragmatics. For more advanced material, use the Muchnick book, or the Compiler Design Handbook (both editions have different materials). They also provide excellent pointers to literature, but aren't great for beginners.<p>I get the impression that most people who recommend the Dragon book haven't read it.

Likewise with numerous pieces.

Just ignore the box on the right and the occasional sponsored link in the top box. Should a flash-based ad appear in the right-hand box there'll be a front-paged topic on it in an hour. reddit has treated it's users well, but they baulk at the slightest change in that - and herein lies the real problem to monetising reddit. reddit has to monetise while keeping it's community happy. Since community happiness and advertising seem to be pretty much polar opposites it seems to be impossible.<p>What I'd do is increase advertising aggressively for non-logged in users, reduce it greatly for registered users and keep the option to remove it completely for gold members. Hopefully those that really hate advertising would sign up for gold, however there is probably a correlation between those that make the most noise about advertising and those that wouldn't do that as they don't believe in paying for things on the internet - completely unfounded but a gut feeling.<p>> Sure it would piss off a lot of users...but it's not like people would abandon a site, just because there are a few more ads present.<p>Being a technical audience AdBlock (already is but) would be widely used rendering it useless.

1642820,comment,1642419,1642680,0,0,jdietrich,,,"I think you may be badly underestimating the track count of a lot of projects. If you aren't banking on having access to all the project plugins at the other end, then any track that is generated or processed by a plugin that isn't part of the factory set will need to be frozen to audio. Obviously there will be no alternates for these tracks, but they still add up. If you're recording live audio, then think of a number, add your age and double it. I would typically mic up a drum kit with between eight and fourteen microphones, depending on the size of the kit and the quality of the room. That is by no means excessive - a bargain-basement set of drum mics will usually consist of seven or eight mics. An electric guitar should get at least three tracks - two mics on the cab and one for DI. A decent pop vocal sound usually demands several tracks for the lead, plus backing. To give you an idea, Greg Kurstin used in excess of 70 tracks on most of the songs on Lily Allen's ""It's Not Me, It's You"" - an album recorded with only one singer, one microphone and two real instruments.<p>Lossy compression is absolutely unacceptable for work-in-progress files. The point of this exercise is to allow project files to be bounced back and forth between collaborators relatively seamlessly. Introduce lossy compression and you have to worry about generational loss - if the guy at the other end edits the file then it goes through the codec again and before long you've got a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy. All the major DAWs can import MP3s, but those that I'm familiar with need to decode them back to WAV/AIFF to handle them internally. This would demand something reasonably clever on the client-side to prevent all sorts of difficulties when an edited song is re-exported and uploaded back, because even without any edits the decode-encode cycle would mean that an exported track would diff with the originally imported version. It also takes bloody ages to bounce every track in a project to MP3, although that could be simplified somewhat if your planned client tool handled it.<p>Also a 10 minute song isn't <i>really</i> long - it's long for a pop or rock single, but by no means unusual for a 12 inch mix in a lot of dance music genres.

I honestly think enough information for figuring things out is present, it's just not always obvious where to look.  There are lots of other passes to look at too, which can be extremely helpful.  Assumptions of the interface, or side-effects, are not always stated, which can be surprising at times.  The other pain point is contributing upstream: you're going to get dinged on formatting, documentation (usually just ""did you do it""; the review is generally not as thorough as say, GDB's documentation review), compilation time, etc. etc.<p>Also, GCC's hash tables (htab_t) are a pain to use correctly.<p>Of course, my experience is somewhat slanted towards the middle-end; the set of pain points is somewhat different if you are working in the front-end or the back-end.  And my set of pain points from the middle-end might be different if I had worked on different optimization passes.  (My passes cared very little about things like aliasing, for instance.)<p>It's surprising to me that you mention memory management as a pain point, though I can see how the variety can be bewildering.  The only distinction that really matters is between GC'd and non-GC'd memory.  obstacks and alloc pools are only ways of providing specialized malloc interfaces.  A useful rule of thumb is that if your data is only needed for one pass of the compiler, then you can allocate it any way you like; if the data is longer-lived than that, it needs to go in GC'd memory.  I can elaborate if you'd like, but that's the basic idea.<p>FWIW, I agree that the whole GC system is somewhat baroque.  The GC was a decent solution to an engineering problem and the whole mechanism nicely solved memory management problems and provided the basis for precompiled headers, but it causes problems in other ways nowadays and trying to get rid of it would be a huge effort.",1283043844
