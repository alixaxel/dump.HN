The new shot looks like they moved most of that into 3 icons on the top right.<p>Unfortunately they moved the tabs next to the location bar, which means they will now be competing for space, but definitely trimming down and moving where all the menu options are is a plus in my eyes.<p>They also added the idea of greater emphasis on the back button which is certainly more frequently used, which is nice.",1282913967

Certainly characters like _why were in that camp.<p>In regards to monkey-patching, while I'm not a Ruby programmer by any means, I sorely feel its absence in other languages. It's in JavaScript (expando objects as well as being able to override and overwrite built-in methods of existing types), and to some extent available in C# (extension methods are a sort-of expando object, but there is very little ability to overwrite a method). Like operator overloading, sure, don't build a project completely off of it (I'm looking at you, C++'s iostream), but when you need it, damn you need it. I'm still delving into Python (late to the party, whatever), but I definitely use Python in much more of a tinkering fashion, so monkey-patching is something I would desire in the language.",1282913735

Is Instant Personalization (""InP"") built on an open protocol?<p>In other words, if I build foo.example.com and it uses InP to access Facebook's social graph, and later on I decide I also want to support Google's social graph, will Google be able to serve that graph using the same InP protocol?  Or can I write a middleware service that grabs data with InP, massages the data (e.g. ""filter out only the friends who live in a particular zip code"") and reexports the data using the InP protocol?<p>Or will Facebook's lawyers be fighting such a move every step of the way?<p>B.

Nevertheless the (non-existent) dilemma relies on the false assumptions that:<p>1. Deciding on a single codec that everyone should use for everything, forever (or until we get to have the same discussion again with HTML6) is the only way forward. Which is just stupid and ignorant. Different codecs are good for different use cases. There is no ""one true codec""and there never will be. H.264 is a good all-around video codec for hi-def internet video, which is why it is popular on sites like YouTube, etc.<p>2. ""Support"" does not have to mean including code in the Firefox browser for decoding H.264 video. It simply means that the browser makes a best effort try to play the video. That's all that the end user really cares about, and that is easily accomplished by using the codec frameworks already present in most modern operating systems.

1638564,comment,1638492,1638492,0,0,quant18,,,"I get quite suspicious when a linguist claims that there's some language where you can't possibly give directions by reference to your body orientation. What's more likely is that giving directions that way is stigmatised very strongly, so that the linguist never hears anyone do it, and if he accidentally did it himself, it would confuse his interlocutor.<p>To give an analogy: if a linguist from Mars gathered a corpus of business English conversation, he'd notice that men refer to something 36 inches off the ground as ""desk height"" rather than ""penis height"", and call a sphere an inch or so in diameter ""ping pong ball size"" rather than ""testicle size"". Similarly a small discus is ""penny sized"" (adjusting for your local currency) rather than ""anus sized"", a small stone is ""fist-sized"" rather than ""ballsack-sized"", etc. Is this because in English it's linguistically impossible to make comparisons to your genital or excretory organs? No, it's because it's socially unacceptable at work; someone may complain to HR and get you fired if you make that comparison.<p>Similarly, the reason the egocentric direction system is so dominant in Western (and Chinese, Japanese, etc.) culture is because of habit and custom --- urban civilians don't usually see sunrise or sunset from inside the office buildings and malls in which they're most likely to give these kinds of directions, so they never get instinctively oriented and the habit of giving directions by compass points never takes off. It has nothing to do with linguistics.<p>And in the right situation, giving east-west-north-south style directions actually can take hold (which is helpful when you've got two sets of elevators and telling someone to ""turn left"" after getting off will send them walking in a fairly random direction). At certain times in my life, all my colleagues knew their north from their south. Were we all members of a sensitive indigenous tribe with a deep connection to nature due to our special mother tongue? No, we were stock traders; we knew which way was east in the building because our asses were in our seats before dawn and we watched the sun rise through the same window every day and set through the opposite one. Put us in a different building (e.g. due to switching jobs) and we'd be confused for a few days, just like the Bali kid who tried to get dance lessons from a teacher in another village.",1282911331
