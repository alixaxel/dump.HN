They can all be uploaded to a single location/group rather than spread out among several different facebook albums. In addition, only the users within the group can view them.

1631879,comment,1631682,1631794,0,0,tmsh,,,"Actually, I think you have to go back further. My grandfather, a poor kid from west LA, went to UCLA and then UC Berkeley as an engineering student back in the late 1930s / early 1940s.<p>He learned Latin in high school (think inner city kid learning Latin). Grew up with all the airfields in LA and mechanical engineering seemed like the thing, I guess. So despite being interned (he was a Japanese American) he went on to be a very successful engineer and eventually businessman (owned his own hydraulics company, etc.).<p>It's arguable that a lot of this happened because of a golden age in California's educational system. Same thing with my parents. I've met them and they're idiots -- but at least my father benefited greatly from UC Berkeley (he's a philosophy professor).<p>I think PG is right to question what exactly is going on. But there really was an extraordinary investment in higher education (for whatever reason) in the early- to mid- 20th century. And arguably, that affected a lot of things which we Californians take for granted.<p>I think what the OP is trying to say is that our attitude about public education has changed. It was irrational, the level of investment that was made into higher education pre-1980s (both raising and allocating funds). And today's set of challenges may require a different emphasis (e.g., charter schools, leaner campuses, more online learning, etc.) -- but that generous spirit that, afaik, built California into a great state -- that's not worth overlooking.",1282704592

No matter what the budget shortfall, the government must meet these obligations.<p>3) When revenues increased during the DOT COM boom, government was more than happy to spend the increased revenue on new services rather than either decreasing taxes or saving the money in a ""rainy day"" fund.<p>4) California is a mess of red-tape and bureaucracy.

I contend that we have almost no idea about that.<p>He is right to blame all of California's ills on tax cuts.  They and Oregon have had the worst abuses of the proposition system of all the states.  Both used to be prosperous with balanced budgets, but had sneaky time-bomb anti-tax measures voted in, which prevented them from raising revenues even as home prices went up (which should increase the amount of tax owed on a property, but didn't) and inflation made existing fixed dollar amounts worth less and less.<p>The example I know best is Oregon, where a guy named Bill Sizemore (currently indicted for tax evasion) organized and ran a successful campaign for a measure that required a super-majority of <i>registered voters</i> to vote yes in order to pass any tax increase in a non-presidential election year.  Thus, not going to the polls counts as a ""no"" rather than a ""I don't care"".  Another Oregon measure required that the taxed value of a property could rise by no more than 3% per year.  Thus, when I owned a house in Oregon, I was only taxed on two thirds of its value (this is slightly pre-bubble, too - now it is much worse!).<p>Anyhow, lots of this sneaky stuff has led to the states being almost totally broke, and their respective education systems, which were once the best in the nation, are now circling the bowl.

As you know, Bob, in mediaeval times the musical interval of a tritone -- three tones, or six semitones -- was called ""diabolus in musica"", <i>the devil in music</i>. It was called that because it's a highly discordant interval; in equal temperament (which of course they didn't have back then, but hush) it corresponds to a frequency ratio of sqrt(2). And why does that sound highly discordant? Well, basically because there's no simple rational number that's a really good approximation to sqrt(2); for much much more about what's going on here, put ""William Sethares"" into Google and consider buying his book. In fact, in a certain sense sqrt(2) is the second-worst-approximable-by-rationals irrational number, which is related to the fact that its continued fraction is [1,2,2,2,2,2,2,...]. And what's the worst-approximable irrational number, which would produce an even more dissonant musical interval -- a maximally dissonant one -- something even worse than the devil himself in music?<p>Why, the golden ratio, of course.
