The problem with following Wall Streets advice to put all your money in stocks is that they make too much money from trading commissions to trust them for impartial advice.<p>Typical investment advisors tell you to buy stocks and then point out that over the last century stocks have done very well.  The problem is that none of us are investing on 100 year long timelines.  We are usually investing on 30-40 year timelines and hoping to have a good amount saved when we retire.  If you happen to need to retire and start pulling money out in a bad year like 2008, you're screwed.<p>Check out this allocation for returns as good as stocks without the huge downside risk: <a href=""http://crawlingroad.com/blog/2008/12/22/permanent-portfolio-historical-returns/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crawlingroad.com/blog/2008/12/22/permanent-portfolio-...</a>",1282474698

1624488,comment,1624312,1624312,0,0,makmanalp,,,"The nice things about this are:<p>a) From what I know, re-melting down plastic only works so many times till you hit a quality barrier, this can make use of the plastic that <i>that</i> process can't use.<p>b) This can make use of trash that otherwise would not have been recycled. It seems pretty agnostic about what plastics it accepts which is good, but on the other hand it also makes me wonder about byproducts in the oil and if or how they are extracted / disposed of.<p>Of course, at this point the price of waste plastic is cheap but it seems like if this caught on, then the oil suppliers would raise their prices for the raw plastic manufacturers, who would then have to raise prices for bottles and such, which in turn would probably lead to bottled drinks costing more. Which might even incentivize people to buy less of things with plastic packaging!<p>This price increase doesn't really apply much for the ton of existing plastic waste that we already have though, which can be obtained cheap, converted back to oil, then sold. All in all, this sounds great!",1282474393
1624487,comment,1622827,1623149,0,0,illumin8,,,"Or, it might not.  Stocks have been flat to negative over the last decade.  Stocks are great when they are going up.  You can make amazingly high returns, but the market has this bad habit of crashing every few years or so, and if you're relying on it for retirement money, you might be screwed.  I truly hope you weren't heavily invested in stocks and needed to retire at the end of 2008, or in 2002.<p>I've found a much better portfolio allocation that gives similar long term returns to being invested in equities, but without the wild swings:<p><a href=""http://crawlingroad.com/blog/2008/12/22/permanent-portfolio-historical-returns/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crawlingroad.com/blog/2008/12/22/permanent-portfolio-...</a>",1282474341

1624484,story,,,15,6,tripplez,"Ask HN: How do you organize studying for a course?",,"I need feedback on how people organize the whole process of studying for particular knowledge/skills domain, be it a university course or a new technology needed for his work/startup/etc.<p>More specifically, the questions without ordering:<p>* How do you organize the study materials and documents - textbooks/ebooks, papers, lecture notes, video lectues, assignments/exercises (+ answers) - generally the knowledge sources? The missing part for me is a way for centralized access for all these documents. The best that I've come up is a personal wiki with a page for the course and links to all the relevant documents. In theory, it should work, but it becomes a mess fairly quickly after the number of documents exceed, for instance, 10-15.<p>* How do you manage the tasks / ""atomic"" things that needs to get done next (the ""Next Action"" in the Getting-Things-Done lingo)? Do you use software application to handle these for you, and if you do, which one? The challenge here is mainly the multiple books/documents that need to be tracked for the reading progress, exercises done progress, etc.<p>The applications that I've tried using the above requirements with mixed success were: Wikidpad (personal desktop wiki), Thinking Rock (desktop GTD application), MonkeyGTD (personal browser-based wiki with GTD features), ToDoList2 (desktop todo application).<p>To recap, I still searching for a ""solution"" that allows me to follow this sort of workflow on my studies. Use case scenario:<p>1. On the day scheduled for study, I open the application and I see the very next concrete things that needs to get done. For instance: read Section 2.3 from Book #1; read Section 3.5 from Book #3; do exercises 1, 5, 11 from Book #4 (page 345); watch video lecture #4 and take notes....<p>2. As I'm crossing off the things that gets done I'm adding the next actions to be done that need to show off on the ""project home page"" when I return for the next study session.<p>3. The ""tasks""/""actions"" provide easy access for the study resources that are involved in completing the task - for instance, hyperlinks to the documents, files, etc.<p>Thanks you for your patience",1282474109

But the technology itself--the underlying standards--must necessarily evolve at a slower pace than a proprietary language like ActionScript.

1624467,comment,1624250,1624323,0,0,skinnymuch,,,"Did you mean to say a few hundred visits a year? If you did or you just meant something else...then I'm sorry for the rest of my post. A few hundred visits a day is respectable. Though not easy or common, it is possible to do $10+/day with a few hundred visits/day.<p>Quick math: let's assume few hundred = 300 visits/day. Also have to assume the blog is self hosted so all revenue is kept in-house (unlike the bloggers in the article). So 300 visits x 5 page views = 1500 pageviews/day. That equals $7 CPM and a bit over $10/day or ~$3,750/year. Not messing with revenue from the feed or anything since this is just hypothetical numbers anyway. The change above the $10 will be enough to pay for hosting + domain costs. Alternatively, if you meant a few hundred views/day then dividing $3,750 by 5 still yields $750. Ah...I'm rambling and I doubt anyone cares too much so I'll stop.<p>Regarding the actual post, I don't agree with the fee either. This reminds me of a homeless SF guy trying to get back on his feet by shining shoes - SF came up to him and demanded he get a license and some other stuff too.
