I even played around with arc3 for a bit because I was curious.<p>Every job I've had I keep coming back to Unix scripting.  It's just the one language that I need to always know and I constantly come back to it.  I used to work on a wide smattering of very ancient Unix boxes so I had to get comfy with ksh.  I use awk and sed daily just for wading through source code.<p>I used to spend every day coding in the scripting language for the Ameritech ISDN bulk call generator.  I still have nightmares.

1625235,comment,1624307,1625029,0,0,randomwalker,,,"Huh?<p>1. The motive here is fairly straightforward -- they are trying to silence the researcher. (Edit. There is of course also the fact that they want to find the identity of the source; I don't know which of these is the primary motivation.)<p>2. 10 years ago or probably even 5 years ago this would have absolutely worked. The Indian government just hasn't woken up to the fact that news travels fast these days due to the Internet, and they can't control it. Indeed, the Indian media aren't even covering this. That's probably what they were counting on.<p>3. It is also clear to me that it is not malice. Their point of view is that if these pesky security researchers didn't go around poking flaws, then no one will find them and exploit them. Regrettably, that is a surprisingly common view. For example, many commenters right here on hacker news criticized my research on those grounds (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1193417"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1193417</a>)<p>4. Yes, most people are going to go on with their lives. What else would you expect -- there are dozens of these minor atrocities happening around the world every day, there simply isn't enough time to do something about all of them. A good many people in India and elsewhere <i>are</i> doing something about this, and I believe it is making a difference. Police brutality (let alone random arrests) used to be common in India; things have gotten dramatically better in the last decade due to activism.<p>You often throw out these terms from philosophy/logic; that doesn't make your arguments more logical.

At least as far as I could tell from the video.<p>The difference being, in true multi-cursor selections, you actually have several cursors which <i>behave like cursors</i>. So, for example, you can do ""ctrl+right"", and all the cursors move forward one word. Even if all the words are a different length, the cursors behave correctly.<p>This seems like a small deal but is actually huge.

1625224,comment,1624770,1624770,0,0,_delirium,,,"> ""If you want to rebut a post, then you can create your own blog and post your rebuttal there.""<p>This is actually the common mode of conversation in one area of the academic blogosphere I follow, and it's <i>annoying as hell</i>. I would definitely not want it to become a common model.<p>Instead of centralizing a discussion in comments somewhere, I have to follow a web of ""Just writing a quick note in reply to Michael here"" and trackbacks and whatnot amongst 5-8 blogs that usually participate in the conversation. If you're not following it in real-time, it's especially annoying to try to reconstruct the conversation, versus if it were in one blog's comments, or a web forum somewhere, or on a mailing list, or anything else other than 5-8 people with separate blogs replying to each other on their own blogs. In this case, though, it's less due to blog authors not wanting comments (most have them on), and more due to the repliers always thinking their reply is so important that it has to be kicked up to a reply-post, rather than living as a mere blog comment.<p>I do like the ""blogs are publishing"" analogy he uses, but for negative reasons: instead of people conversing directly, this model of ""reply on your own blog"" results in the equivalent of everyone printing up broadsides or pamphlets with their ideas. So you print your pamphlet, and if someone disagrees, they print their own, and instead of 5 people discussing things, you have 5 pamphleteers scattering their dueling pamphlets around town.<p>Nonetheless, the old model of publishing documents on the web seems fine, but I don't see why it should be in blog format then. If you have a document that's worth ""publishing"", imo it should usually be of somewhat lasting interest, and you should pick a format other than reverse-chronological-order to organize your published documents (though it's fine to have a ""recent documents"" list to direct frequent readers to what's new).",1282509739

Me pressing call <i>is</i> the bit where I check if you're available.<p>Part of the problem is that it's not always simple to silence a Skype call (like you could a phone) if you're busy. But then you also have the option, unlike a phone, of marking yourself as busy.<p>That last bit is, for me, the better innovation :)<p>(BTW constantly asking permission is a common grip of mine; ""can I ask a question?"" is one of the most annoying things in the world :))",1282508006

Consider all the times you’ve seen some blogger apologize for not posting recently – profusely addressing some concern that likely was never expressed. Or the Twitter updates to 38 followers, half of which are bots or uncaring companies. More realistically, maybe you’ve read too much into looks from a table of girls at a restaurant (a type I evolutionary error). Maybe you like like to roll down the windows in your car, turn up the stereo and know that everyone is just so impressed by your classic taste.</i><p>This isn't really directed a Leo since he does actually have an audience, but people obviously aren't hanging off of his every utterance.

I've had Facebook for years, and by friend count has steadily increased and is now nearing 900. The users who only have 100 friends now will eventually be in the unmanageable and uncomfortable position of having 1000 friends, and by that point I won't be surprised if my count is approaching 1500.<p>Facebook certainly seems to want everyone to have as many friends as possible (note the friend suggestion features), so it's only a matter of time before everyone is presenting themselves to such a large auditorium.",1282507394
