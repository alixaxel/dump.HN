1624043,comment,1623383,1623383,0,0,todayiamme,,,"I remember a talk I attended by Rodney Brooks roughly 4 years ago, in which he used this example to show how exponential change catches up. He quoted a Kodak executive who remarked that it was the future and they all knew it, but they just let it slide after that. Why? As Mr. Graham's recent essay about Yahoo! pointed out Kodak had a cash cow in the form of film and they didn't want to see something as radically disruptive as a digital camera. Everyone knew about it, but they didn't want to see it. I think that its quite an understandable form of self deception.<p>So, what they did was they put it under a pillow and hoped that it would go away. A smaller competitor on the other hand had nothing to lose discovered the technology and along with others exponentially improved it (the megapixels war) until the film was outdated at last. If you think about it if Kodak had been willing to go out of their comfort zone they would have owned the camera market today.<p>The most interesting thing is that if everything had been a constant then it wouldn't have mattered. Self deception works really well in fields like politics etc. but over here we had a phenomena that accelerated the change and suddenly we had a positive feedback cycle to sustain it. This is why technology is so interesting in my opinion. Opinions don't matter. If something has technological merit then regardless of the fact of what you think about it. It's going to improve and take over your constant.<p>What's troubling though is just how counter-intuitive it is and just how many of us fall into the trap of thinking; 'nah it ain't gonna happen'.",1282441828

I'm not staying more than I should, and if I put on extra time (funny that I still do this a lot, I guess I just love what I do), its on my terms. Not happy, then let me know when to quit.<p>I also found out that when you go through the extra mile a lot, without proper compensation, they will treat you cheap. In a way, its sort of true, since if we put more effort that we are paid for, then we are cheap in that sense. Its easier to get respect when you just stick to your guns and politely declined those request for extra effort unless its paid up for. You may not get what you demanded, but its easier for them to treat you with respect (oddly!).<p>The lesson that I learned from my version of failed startup is that you should have the funder/entrepreneur to know the trade. Warren Buffet says never invest on anything that you do not understand. If the funder/investor/entrepreneur does not know the trade, then there is no way they could tell that you are telling the truth, other than pushing your buttons.

Temporarily, at the very least, to stop the bounces.<p>Personally, I think a hard bounce is more courteous to the senders.  Sure, it'll mess up list subscriptions, but that's what you get for not keeping tabs on your quota.  But a bounce will alert the sender so they can follow up with a reliable method of communication.<p>I know people will get their knickers in a wad over this, but I don't think that anyone should rely on email for <i>anything</i> of real import.  2010 or not, it's not (obviously) very reliable in that you'll never know if the recipient actually read it.  Fax it, call them, send a letter.<p>I worked support for an email provider for a while, and I regularly shook my head in awe of the epic stupidity (ignorance, if you prefer) of people trusting such an ethereal medium for ""important"" correspondence.",1282438870
