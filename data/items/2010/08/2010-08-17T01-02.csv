I really do think my definition is the mainstream.<p>I just draw a distinction between using techniques common in compilers vs actual compilers.  I agree those things that Jerf listed may use techniques common in compilers, call them compilation techniques, but I still don't think they're compilers.  I dont' think that makes them bad programs, but they're not compilers.  And frankly, I think even those who the community deems as expert would say the same thing.

(That's why I mentioned in my original reply that it partly depends on your traffic.)<p>""you're wrong about how banner buys work""<p>No I'm not wrong. First, I'm not interested in developing an app to sell low CPM banners. Low CPM means you are untargeted--I'm targeted. Second, the vast majorty of people on this site and doing startup do not have boatloads (100s of thousands  of pageviews per day) to justify the type of ad buying your are recommending. They don't have the time nor overhead capacity to hire a staff of salespeople.

The closing is implicit, of course; it happens right away as soon as there are no more references to the file. Because, obviously, nothing else would make sense.""<p>This behavior isn't even guaranteed in CPython (and never has been as far as I know).  There's a problem with deterministic destructors and refcounting:  if there's a reference cycle, which destructor gets called first?<p><pre><code>    import weakref
    import gc

    class Something(object):

    s2 = Something(s1)
    s1.other = s2
    del s1
    del s2
    gc.collect()
    print gc.garbage
</code></pre>
Even the cyclic garbage collector won't pick this up.  These kinds of issues come up more and more if you rely on python's __del__ methods (aka destructors).   The solution?  Quit complaining and just use a with block.  It isn't <i>that</i> bad.",1282009633

This doesn't really count, since I gave up halfway through--the translation is horrible.<p>I'm currently reading Vellum, by Hal Duncan.<p>I have, I think, about 5-6 more books on my to-read pile at the moment, and I could triple that with a visit to the bookstore.  (I'm avoiding visiting the bookstore because my budget would not appreciate the experience.)<p>As you can see, I mostly read SF.  This list is a bit unusual, in that it includes a number of books from the same series; I usually mix things up more than this.<p>It's true that I read books that many wouldn't take the time to read.  I don't think that's because those books are less interesting; I think it's because most people have much less interest in reading than I do, and therefore are satisfied with fewer books.<p>It seems to me that you're formulating an argument where I have lower standards than people who read less--that people who read few books stick to the cream of the crop, while people like myself who read more are willing to read inferior works as well.  As a counterargument, I submit Dan Brown, an author who produces (from my perspective) works of such execrable quality that only a person with little awareness of how good books can be would waste their time on him.<p>To shift arenas: Consider two people.  One of them eats nothing but steak and potatoes.  The other is Anthony Bourdain, the host of the Travel channel's ""No Reservations"".  Would it be correct to say that the reason the former eats such a smaller variety of food is that there's a lack of truly good food that lives up to the standards of the almighty steak and potatoes?<p>Of course not.  We'd say that Mr. Steak & Potatoes just doesn't like food as much as Bourdain.  (In general; he likes his steak just fine, and there's nothing wrong with that.)<p>Or to take myself as an example: I don't watch much television.  Is the problem that there's just a lack of really <i>good</i> television out there, and I'd watch more if someone started producing more good shows like The Wire?  Well, no.  The problem is that I just don't like television all that much, and would rather spend my leisure time on other activities like books, video games, and programming.  There are already plenty of TV shows that I'm certain I'd enjoy...if I had time to watch them.<p>So, no, I don't think that people in general would read more if only there were more good novels being written.  There are <i>plenty</i> of good novels out there.",1282008360
1609906,comment,1608129,1609713,0,0,jerf,,,"The definition of ""computer language"" is very broad. Study your basic computer theory again; they don't call those things ""languages"" for laughs. JSON is a computer language; it sure as hell isn't a human language. Bitmaps are computer languages, as are PNGs or GIFs. HTML is a computer language. And to the extent the Dragon authors didn't mean it that way, I don't really care, because your definition sucks for a fundamental reason that I outlined before but will outline again: It convinces people they only need to know compiler theory if they are outputting ""object code"". And that's an absolutely <i>terrible</i> thing for a definition to do. By that standard mine is <i>way</i> better, in the way that a ""good"" thing is way better than a ""bad"" thing.<p>A compiler takes in a stream of symbols and translates it to another stream of symbols. Common compiler techniques include intermediate tree representations, parsing of symbols, various recursion-based optimization passes on the intermediate representation and phases, and various serialization techniques. Probably the most distinctive characteristic of a compiler is the existence of a usually-tree-based (though not always) intermediate representation that is neither the input language nor the output language, though in some cases you can optimize past this. (You won't get good program-size-scaling this way, but if your task is constrained it can be a good choice.)<p>There exist no software engineering terms that have universally agreed-upon meanings. If you wish to insist that a compiler must maintain semantic meanings, that is a valid choice, but I reject the idea that it is the only choice, and I reject the idea that it's even a <i>good</i> choice. A definition of compiler that focuses on the use of the distinctive techniques of compilers, the parsing, the intermediate representation, the manipulation of the intermediate representation for some effect, the re-serialization to some format, is much more useful for almost any use outside of a classroom. (Which I do not wish to impugn; that is a valid use.) Because, to hammer it home one more time, the techniques you learn in compiler class is useful all over the place and I have concrete experience (as does Stevey) that way way too many people have never learned those techniques. You aren't going to help anybody learn more about these techniques if you insist that the only ""compiler"" is a radical subset of the things that use compilation techniques. You do nobody any favors by standing on your definition and perpetuating the idea that these are esoteric techniques of limited use. (Note I did not say you <i>believe</i> the idea that these are esoteric techniques of limited use, I said you are <i>perpetuating</i> it.)<p>Notepad isn't a compiler that I can see; that's a strawman. It's a continuum, not a binary yes/no, but it uses basically no compilation techniques, and I wouldn't be surprised that at least the initial implementation used none at all. The original was limited to 64KB, IIRC, and at that point even on the computers of the era you could just directly manipulate an array. No intermediate representation distinct from the input, no parsing, no serialization, it's not checking any of the checkboxes.",1282008340

But I'd also state they often do use compiler technology, as do many other programs.  I've spent a fair bit of time working on many of the things you note, model checkers and query optimizers in particular.<p>But lets be clear, compiler technology is not the same thing as being a compiler.  And yes, terminology matters.  If you say, ""I've written a compiler"" and you show me HangMan... I'll scratch my head.  You don't get to just say ""Everything is a compiler"", simply because compilers manipulate data and so do all other programs.",1282008295

In August 1945 most of the Japanese fleet was at the bottom of the sea, and they didn't have enough fuel for the rest. Ditto the air force -- there wasn't enough fuel, and pilots were poorly trained 9not enough fuel to train them).<p>The USSR in 1945 had thousands of effective fighter and bomber aircraft that could have won air superiority over the waterways needed to invade Japan. The distances an invasion would have to travel aren't enormous: 50 miles from Tsushima or 20 miles from Sakhalin. The Japanese would have found it difficult to send reinforcements against the Russian beachheads, because, again, they had little fuel, and Russian aircraft could have bombed the railways, putting them out of action.<p>Once the Russians had got a sizable body of men ashore, it would have been difficult or impossible for the Japanese to dislodge them: the Russian army was much better equipped and led than the Japanese army, and had just beaten the best army in the world. Japanese courage and self-sacrifice wouldn't have been able to make up that, any more than it was against the USMC.<p>The biggest difficulty I see for the Russians is whether they would have been able to cobble together enough ships to transport the necessary men and equipment.<p>Having said all that, Japan was deeply deeply fucked before Russia entered the war anyway.",1282008234
