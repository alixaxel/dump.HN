Look at the price difference of the machines, for starters, and also the demographics of iPad purchasers - these are mainly well-off people and I think if they wanted a netbook style machine they'd buy one as well as an iPad.  There may be a small overlap of people who were looking for a netbook and would/could pay the extra money to buy an iPad instead, but at about a £300+ price hike I would think that these would be in the minority - most people who aren't buying Asus are buying other company's netbooks instead.  Asus have had a period of being the dominant seller over netbooks, but I think a lot of other people are producing more competitive machines and so Asus are losing share/sales to them, rather than Apple",1282214902

1616977,comment,1614808,1616100,0,0,abalashov,,,"I suspect a lot of ""private offices for developers because their #1 enemy is distractions"" talk is cover for the introverted preferences of many developers.  This type of personality sees almost all chit-chat as inherently distracting.<p>I have been in the seemingly unusual position of being a highly extroverted - dare I say, socially dependent? - developer and technician in my career.  As such, I found it gratifying to be able to talk to my coworkers easily both from a workflow perspective and, well, just to socialise.  It has led to some enduring professional and personal relationships that have lasted long beyond my past jobs themselves, and has formed the basis of a number of key business opportunities for me.<p>So, I think a more outgoing person is more likely to find some satisfaction in being able to talk to others easily, instead of consciously having to leave his/her secluded office and wander around--looking conspicuously unproductive in ways considered uncouth in corporate America--for that purpose.  Such a person is also going to find it easier to manage the distractions posed by others in more natural, intuitive, fluid ways than awkwardly putting on headphones or demonstratively ignoring someone.<p>There are ways to make people around you go away or pipe down without confirming their ugly stereotype of developers as Asperger's geeks;  for clues, if this behaviour does not strike you as self-evident, take a look at how people in more managerial, sales-y and marketing roles do it.  They say things like, ""Well!  I need to get back to this (gestures to screen), I'll catch up with you in a while,"" or, ""Excuse me, I really gotta call this guy back...""  That's congenial code for GTFO;  it does rely on your companion to get the message, but you'd have to be dealing with some pretty thick people for them to be oblivious to the GTFO part.<p>That said, I definitely understand and sympathise with the plight of those stuck in noisy cubicle farms replete with salespeople and ringing phones, the sort of suit-driven sardine floor plan that inspired this whole ""offices for developers"" movement.  To appreciate what I have to say above without running for the hills screaming, you definitely need to be in a <i>basically manageable</i> noise, people and traffic situation and have fundamentally <i>reasonable</i> coworkers and management, from the perspective of a technical implementor.",1282214356

1616975,comment,1616704,1616880,0,0,pbiggar,,,"App Engine is a pain in the ass, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Heroku is so simple to use that I've many times felt that someone needs to build a Heroku for Python.<p>The only thing really wrong with App Engine is the datastore:<p>- It's very different than anything you've come across before
- The docs are not sufficient for it's complexity. You end up having to read lots of blogs and watch lots of videos to figure it out.
- It is ridiculously difficult to learn (one of the hardest things I ever had to do)
- Important parts of your stack won't work, like Admin
- You can't just add the fields you like to an object. Instead you need to meticulously plan _how_ your data is going to be accessed. This is exactly the wrong thing for a startup, since you can't get up and running fast.
- You can't iterate fast, because any schema change is very risky and very slow.
- If you don't get everything exactly right, your app will be very slow.
- There isn't much in the ecosystem.<p>By contrast, none of these are true for Heroku.<p>There are some things that are pretty good about App Engine:<p>- the tools are pretty good. Not as good as Heroku, but good.
- the billing is spot on. They give you about $1 per day of free stuff, which can maintain a site with hundreds of thousands of users. And it's pretty cheap from there on.
- They scale it automatically. On Heroku, it's really hard to tell how many ""dynos"" (whatever the hell that is) you need, except by trial and error. I would expect that nearly all Heroku apps are overprovisioned. App Engine just nails the scaling - it happens automatically, and you specify a maximum amount to pay per day, with lots of different dials to control it more precicely if you like.<p>I hope Djangy takes the best of both worlds.",1282214338

1616936,comment,1616933,1616933,0,0,doratech,,,"	Earlier this year, in a new attempt to attract more customers to its stores, North Face, which sells outdoor apparel and gear, had decided to adopt a novel strategy of location-enabled mobile ads which was powered by LOC-AID. In a nutshell, the company sent promotional text messages to people as soon they are in a defined radius of their stores. Cell phones have long intrigued advertisers because they form part of person’s personal accessories which can be used as a vehicle through which you can track a person’s location in relation to his or her distance from a store. Marketer’s place value on the ability to message a person, when he or she is close to a point of sale.<p>North Face’s mobile campaign early this year was location-enabled by LOC-AID Technologies, the largest mobile location aggregator in the Americas. The campaign was crafted by Placecast, a mobile ad company. The technology used is sometimes referred to as Geo-fencing. When a person crosses a virtual threshold, a text message is sent, but conditional on the person having accepted to receive messages. Placecast uses a number of techniques like triangulation and a phone’s GPS signal to establish its precise location. In suburban areas the texting range  was set to be a mile from the store, while in urban areas it was half that. North Face was enabled to send messages about promotions and new arrivals in the first instance. Per the NYT article dated  February 22, 2010, North Face would restrict the number of messages per week to avoid annoyance and will ensure the messages should not be construed as intrusive. Mobile advertising is expected to have a $ 1.4 billion budget by 2014.",1282212229
