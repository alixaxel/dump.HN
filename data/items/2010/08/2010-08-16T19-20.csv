It took some practice at first, but focusing completely on the person telling the story[1], and actually telling meaningful stories[2] turns out to not be that hard once you get the hang of it.<p>[1] This means not only listening and popping in with comments and questions here and there, but actually trying to imagine the feelings you would have experienced had you been there; or even more interestingly, understanding how the storyteller felt in the context of his or her own life (this requires knowing the person rather well).<p>[2] The intent is really the main thing here. Some people approach storytelling about their adventures as a way to brag. The ""right way"" to do it is to tell the story in a way that the listeners can imagine themselves there. This changes the context from ""I'm cooler than you,"" to ""I had a great experience that I'd like to share with you.""",1281988715

The <i>entirety</i> of the construction industry was based on borderline, if not outright slavery of foreign nationals. This is not the case of ""yeah, there were a few bad apples in the bunch"", this was widespread and almost universal. (Again, if you'd like to contest this perception, please feel free). The Dubai skyline as we see it today was impossible to create at that cost, in that timeline, without labor abuses that would make most developing nations look like Eden.<p>I find it hard to believe that a hacker-friendly and creative-friendly space can exist amidst so much moral corruption and especially in such a closed society.<p>I am unsure if you've had the opportunity to visit some of the more tech-centric and creative-centric cities of the world - but you will notice that creative types (hackers included) tend to be a weird bunch. Around me right now are people with strange haircuts, strange sexual preferences, strange (and to some, offensive) clothes, strange habits... etc. Hell, even in a socially liberal place like the US many of these people are decidedly non-mainstream and are merely tolerated, not celebrated. Nonetheless, here they are protected and free. They also thrive on liberal, bohemian substance - not the glitzy, luxurious sophistique that Dubai is shooting for.<p>Dubai does not sound at all like a place where hackers and artists would want to call home. In fact, half the creative types I know would be at risk of imprisonment in that country. IMHO it is impossible to nurture a creative space in a closed, socially hyper-conservative country. Social conservatism is historically the antithesis of artistry - and this includes the middle east. The most scientifically and artistically prolific eras of the middle east all came during reigns of particularly secular (or at least, non-fundamentalist) governments.",1281988706

I have my undergraduate degree already, but my education did not include AI, OS, compilers, distributed computing or algorithm design.  (That's what I get for going to a hippy liberal arts college.)  It wasn't as bad as what Yegge described as a ""Java certification program,"" since I came out of it knowing a lot of real-world skills like version control and command line use.  However, I still consider the lack of things like compiler construction to be unacceptable gaps in my skillset.<p>Two problems: I have a full-time job and student loans now.  I can't really do the undergraduate schooling thing all over again.<p>What's the best way to pick up these skills post-undergraduate degree?

1608933,story,,,11,5,tripplez,"Ask HN: Recommend a note taking wiki-like ""super"" application?",,"Hello,<p>I'll start with the applications that I've already evaluated and/or used:<p>Wikidpad<p>* Pros:
<i></i> fast switching between the edit and view modes;
<i></i> nice syntax (especially for pasting code snippets or just raw ASCII text, nice indenting visual clues);
<i></i> it is standalone application that don't require server;
<i></i> the wiki pages can be kept in flat text database;
<i></i> easy drag-and-drop of file attachments (especially for image files).
* Cons:
<i></i> doesn't have history/version control of the pages and the state of the wiki database as a whole;
<i></i> doesn't have the concept of namespaces for the wiki pages;<p>MoinMoin wiki<p>* Pros:
<i></i> nice syntax;
<i></i> have standalone server (Python based) which makes it truly portable and standalone;
<i></i> keeps the pages in flat files;
<i></i> have a lots of nice plugins;
* Cons:
its a wiki == slow iterations of editing/taking notes, viewing, rince-repeat...
doesn't have version control integration<p>Trac<p>* Pros:
<i></i> All of the features of the MoinMoin wiki, except the flat file database;
<i></i> Version control integration: I can use the wiki changeset feature and the wiki pages as metadata of my personal codebase;
* Cons:
<i></i> All of the general drawbacks of the wikis;
<i></i> Not truly portable;<p>todolist2 (by AbstractSpoon)<p>* Pros:
<i></i> fast, standalone todolist manager;
<i></i> the tasks have this really nice and important for me feature of having an rich edit box for taking notes associated with the task with flipping between the task and the notes with a single key;
<i></i> time tracking for the tasks;
* Cons:
<i></i> doesn't have version control built-in (it has ""simple"" version control by just making an automatic backup copies of the project/data file with time stamp embedded in its name).
<i></i> it's hard to filter the tasks by urgency (in the GTD terms, it doesn't have the concept of the containers of tasks: Inbox, Maybe, Next action for each project, etc).
<i></i> it doesn't have cross-referencing/linking between the tasks in wiki-like fashion.<p>Thinking Rock<p>* Pros:
<i></i> implements GTD almost perfectly;
<i></i> it has notes for every action;
<i></i> portable;
* Cons:
<i></i> (Maybe because of the Java GUI) doesn't have simple Undo when editing text notes;
<i></i> it's clunky when switching between the projects/actions tree and the editable notes editbox;
<i></i> doesn't have version control;<p>MonkeyGTD/TiddlyWiki<p>* Pros:
<i></i> truly standalone
<i></i> almost 100% wiki
<i></i> nice GTD implementation
* Cons:
<i></i> it's little confusing when there is no easy or user-friendly way to see an overview of the current structure of the wiki pages
<i></i> I'm not sure if it scales well when there is a lots of pages/data/text/attachments.
<i></i> doesn't have source control integration;
<i></i> I'm not sure about version control/pages history...<p>So, to recap, I want an application that does the following:<p>* It has the speed and the ease of edit/preview iteration cycle of wikidpad.
* It has the wiki pages and the associated attachments as they are (like wikidpad and MoinMoin).
* It has version control for the wiki pages (like MoinMoin or Trac).
* It has source control integration (like Trac).
* It has the time tracking of the todolist2 and the task/project nesting like todolist2 and ThinkingRock.
* It has the almost perfect GTD implementation of ThinkingRock or MonkeyGTD.<p>It's obvious that I haven't decided which one to use because for some reason my requirements are somehow orthogonal in the terms of the features that the aforementioned applications...not that the features are orthogonal or it is impossible or not practical...actually I think that maybe wikidpad is the closest to my ideal, which means that:
* I decide to implement the features that I need (to add version control, GTD-life features/properties for the wiki pages themselves, source control integration), or
* Continue to search and evaluate, or
* Get some interesting and valuable opinions here<p>Thank you for your patience",1281987651

Here's a problem that I'm going to end up building a solution to if someone else doesn't do it first (and by all means, please do it because I am lazy and have enough projects to last me for the foreseeable future):<p>A CRUD application generator. You go to a page and define all of your models and basic rules. The models get defined in very simple terms - you give each model a name, and then define each field with dropdowns that define what each field is. If it's a foreign key, you select that in the dropdown. You can select validation for each field from a catalog of validations (phone number, email address, string min length of 5 chars, whatever).<p>Offer addins for commonly needed functionality - for example, I end up using authentication in just about every project and end up having to do a lot of work to get it up and running. So you could have plugins like authentication, private messaging (which would require auth automatically), a ticket system, whatever.<p>Also offer the ability to choose a theme before generating a project.<p>So a user can go to a site, define their models, add any addins they want and pick a theme.<p>Then in the final step, they choose a language and framework they want everything generated in: Python / Django, Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, Ruby on Rails 3.x, Python / Pylons, Scala / Lift, ASP.Net MVC; whatever templates you've gotten built.<p>When it's done, they get a compressed file (zip or tar.gz) that contains the generated application and some programatically created documentation that explains where everything is, how to change the important parts and how to deploy it.<p>There are lots of ways to make money with something like this:<p>* Charge for addins per project<p>* Charge for premium themes<p>* Charge a small amount per project (I like this option the least)<p>* Provide automatic hosting a la Heroku for projects - this would let people with a basic idea but no programming chops get something up in an hour or two instead of trying to find someone to explore the idea with them. For this you'd want to limit it to a subset of frameworks so that you don't have to have a lot of different production environments.<p>* Use a fremium model where people can generate x number of apps a month for free, but over that limitation charge some amount per month. People will try to get around this by registering with multiple email addresses if the product is good, but that's a great problem to have!<p>Although it sounds like you're probably somewhat freed from a profit motive while you're building this, which helps significantly.

You need to be familiar with the domain to execute them well, care enough to put in the work.<p>What domain are you familiar with? HTML/CSS/JS? Backends? Programming IDEs? Text analysis? Surfing the web? (UIs, journalism, communities etc..)<p>I have some ideas.<p>1. Community designer - you'd start with a forum, then add features like up/down votes, ratings, tags, following, blocking, limiting length of posts (aka Twitter), anonymity, chats in threads, micro-comments (quick comments about meaty posts visually separate) topic isolation, user labels (like trolls, political, religious nuts) etc.. You could add and remove features in order to guide the community to be active, post good content, or troll like 4chan.<p>Of course you'd need extensive experience of wasting time on forums, digg, reddit, starting your own forum to approach this idea.<p>2. Code map - lots of projects have a lot of boilerplate code, multiple functions with little inside them, linking to other parts of the program for convenience. Code density map shows where the functional code is in a large project. Complexity map could show where there is long, incomprehensible logic. Dependency map showing which classes have more dependencies than others. Some of these could be documented by the developer, he can label something ""hacky"" and you could see how much of the code-base is ""hacky"" on a map. Long name API map should look different for JQuery and Google Closure (JS frameworks), would be useful for designer coders because they have low tolerance for long lines of text. Would look different for Processing.org vs Java drawing API too.<p>Such a map should look different from one project to the next. It might reveal coding style. Someone who is looking to work on a project could decide if the coding style matches their own without having to dig in to the code. People choosing a framework like Rails, Django could decide based on a map of example projects that do the same task. Compare how verbose one framework is vs another.<p>This is a hard problem with fun social implications. I don't really know how hard, but there should be some intermediate stages for the idea that would be neat, maybe even useful for github.<p>3. Individualized content - user takes a survey of words, concepts he understands, like helium, fusion, deuterium, megawatts, steam turbines and when looking at a news site he would only see the articles where he understands the concepts. If the news site wants to explain these concepts to the individual, they have to write specially written articles that break things down, start at the fundamentals.<p>It's not hard to get ideas after you have some experience, did a lot of research in a domain. As a bonus you have more motivation to work on it than you do on someone else's less familiar idea. That might be a problem for you.",1281987488

You won't get a good CPM no matter what. The exception to this rule is for social networks, who know enough about their users to allow demographic targeting. Even then, the CPM isn't great(I pay less than 20 cents CPM on Facebook for example). Social networks make up for this on volume, because social apps tend to generate a lot of pageviews.<p>That said, you will still do better with ad sales people even if you're selling general, untargeted inventory, especially if you're selling to brand advertisers.<p>Every couple weeks I get pestered by ad sales people from some second-tier social network who are willing to do almost anything to get an IO and commitment for a large number of impressions.

My co-founder and I just finished our second pass at our new app and we were hoping to get some feedback from the HN community.<p>https://www.airdropper.com<p>AirDropper is a Dropbox companion app for requesting files from anyone with an email address. You just authorize your Dropbox account, make a request, and we put the file the person uploads into your Dropbox. Everything's secure in transit, we can handle larger files than most email services, and it's really easy for the person sending the file.<p>To provide some context, I started my own law firm this year, and I immediately ran into some friction in trying to securely get files from clients. Many clients were uncomfortable sending sensitive documents as email attachments. I walked a few clients through signing up with Dropbox and sharing a folder, but that caused a lot of back and forth with creating an account, setting sharing permissions, etc. I talked through the issue with my perennial side-project partner and AirDropper is what we came up with as a solution. We made a ""two week"" version a little while ago and we got some great feedback, especially from designer friends who need to get files from clients that are too big to email.

Yes, the Perl community might have a common way to do it, and in this day and age even a library that does it all for you, and stuff you wouldn't even have thought of yet, but that doesn't mean you can't come up with something better.<p>With the ability to extend the grammar in Perl 6, I believe this will go full circle.

This is a way to potentially help every indie artist/label in the world.<p>I have an entire database of music industry listings. These types of databases usually cost lots of money and therefore independent artists have been excluded from using them. We're talking 50,000 listings spanning across the united states and canada. Lots of independent labels and artists I've spoken to are excited by the prospect of having the most comprehensive music industry contact database available for free, to anyone, any age, anywhere in the world.<p>The database is legit and put together by myself and a friend who is music industry major.<p>THE PROBLEM:<p>The programming behind it sucks. It should be re-built from the ground up, using the database as the starting point. The search is horrible and doesn't pull the results that users expect (even though the results exist!). There should be more community features. The best way for this type of database to stay up to date and accurate is for users to contribute. Users can also talk to each other about what works and begin to talk about their experiences with different contacts.<p>Business prospects:
- advertising
- premium accounts<p>There's always advertising, in this case the ads are to a very niche crowd, so that always helps. There's also reasons why a business with money, like an indie label, might want a premium account.<p>To be honest, this probably doesn't have a big chance of making a lot of money. My hope has always been to make it simply sustainable. The upside is that you are literally helping out every independent musician and label in the united states and canada that wants to be heard. You're  helping the underdog expose their music to the world.<p>If community participation grows, it's easy to start allowing people to post listings from countries other than US/Canada. And that would be awesome.<p>There's quite a few interesting technical challenges this site is facing and currently no one is stepping up to face them. The code, project, and database is yours if you want it. Maybe we put it all under an open license? I'll even continue to help with design/front-end development (photoshop/html/css/js) as that is my strong point.
