1632687,comment,1629521,1629999,0,0,krschultz,,,"It might be that west coast goes to south/central America more often and ease coast goes to Europe, becuase I know a lot of people who have gone to Europe from here but few that have gone south. It makes sense, if I have a week off getting to Europe is only 5 or 6 hours each way, which is roughly the same as california. Flight time is not the big time suck though, it is waiting in airports for connections. A direct flight to central Europe is a lot shorter than a hop from NYC to LA or TX and then a connection to a flight going to south America.",1282741114

There are special ones that are mil-spec that don't have that problem, or you could try your luck with Tantalum.<p>The Sprague brand used to have fairly affordable long life electrolytic caps, maybe you can find those where you live or order them online. That way it's a one time affair.<p>On another note, if you open up the power supply you'll find a bunch of coils in there, some of them are fairly loosely wound, eventually the windings will rub their way through the insulation and short out. It's not a bad idea to put some hotmelt on those windings to dampen the vibration. Just a little line on either side will do wonders.",1282741088

You can secure nonrecourse debt for real estate like this, though this is harder to do than it was a few years ago.<p>But the other way to look at this is that you're going to risk the money one way or the other: either you risk it as indirect collateral by guaranteeing a loan at 80% LTV or you risk it directly by buying the property outright. The advantage in the first scenario is that you get a higher return. YMMV, but again, I'm comfortable with this level of risk.",1282740983

In the intercity schools anyway. However, I do agree with you that the author doesn't prove his point of declining schools, nor does he prove that increased funding will make them better. He offers this poor anecdote that is obviously politically self-edited.<p>It's funny how subjects like bad parenting or horrifying home lives never come into this conversation.

I believe in open source as much as the next guy, but just a few weeks ago there was a thread on this board in which the vast majority of people considered OpenSolaris (with the exception of say, ZFS) had become a sub-par operating system, that they wouldn't want to use. There were a few users, yes, but I think it's glaringly obvious that the death of that project started long before the Oracle aquisition. I'm close friends with several former Sun employees, all of whom had been extremely unhappy in their positions with Sun for a few years. Sun was on the verge of complete financial failure.<p>Yes, Oracle may be being 'evil', but they know how to run a business and make a livelihood for their employees. How many of the people that are complaining actually paid for the real worth of all the Sun products they used? If people rely on Sun so much for their own businesses, how can they expect someone else to maintain it for them at a financial loss? These people have no right to complain about what Oracle is now doing to protect it's investment. Yes, you can make a living from open source. Was Sun doing a good job of that when Oracle got them? Absolutely not.<p>edit: I completely agree that all this was unexpected and is unpleasant, I just don't think it's fair to attack and blame Oracle.",1282740493

It's very much the norm in the real estate world, which has a pretty stellar track record for creating wealth, once you get out of the levels where soccer moms are flipping houses. Buying commercial multifamily real estate isn't about the value of the property; it's about the value of the cashflow stream that you're buying. For certain markets and with long-term demographic trends and forecasts being what they are, I'm very comfortable with that level of risk.<p>If it makes you feel better, run the numbers where you put $2mm or $3mm down, which reduces your return, but also decreases your risk.",1282740371

1632612,comment,1632044,1632115,0,0,rmc,,,"There are usually 2 numbers used to measure the 'accuracy' of a test (be it a ""This link will reach the digg front page"" or ""This person has HIV"" etc.). Those numbers are the false positive rate (you said they'd get to the front page, and they didn't), and the false negative rate (you said they wouldn't get to the front page, and they did).<p>It's common for these numbers to be related. Decrease one number and the other goes up. E.g. you could get a 0% false positive rate by just saying ""Yes this link will get to the front page"" for all pages, however your false negative rate would be massive, about 99.999999% (since you're predicting that every link gets to the front page). This test would be useless because of the high false negative rate. A breakthrough occurs when you are able to have a low false positive and low false negative result. The holy grail of any test is one that would have a 0% false negative and a 0% false positive rate.<p>Usually it's a trade of between false positive and false negative. Most western justice systems would rather a high false negative than a high false positive, ""Better 10 guilty men walk free, than 1 innocent man goes to jail"".<p>His statement about ""63% accuracy"" is ambiguous. What is he refering to? What are the false positive and false negative rates?",1282738886
