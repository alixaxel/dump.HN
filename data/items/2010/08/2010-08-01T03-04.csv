1564716,comment,1564183,1564606,0,0,10ren,,,"That's right - though you enter your own URL. Extra idea: it might also show you complements (products/services that fit in nicely with yours; these are usually pretty obvious in established industries - razors+shaving cream; milk+eggs; tyres +brakepads - but not so obvious in emerging industries. You might not have even thought of the category of a certain complement, let alone the name of it, nor specific brands that do it. It's valuable, because you might consider targeting people who buy the complements. It's a kind of market-research.<p>(Unhelpfully) I think <i>every</i> website could benefit from it. Probably  emergent and fast-moving markets would benefit most (because they don't yet know their competitors/complements + it's all changing very fast anyway). A very specific start would be... y-combinator offerings (that have just launched - not the established onces); for fun, you could also do it for emerging languages (like Mirah). These aren't ideal biz markets, but they would gain attention here on HN, and might validate the basic idea (to see if it's possible.) For example, if you were able to find a competitor to a YC company that they didn't know about, it would be pretty compelling evidence (and will surely happen, since startups rarely look very closely for competitors; they are too busy  <i>doing</i>. Which is a good thing. Knowing about competitors too early can be artificially discouraging. So this is probably most helpful for companies that already have enough traction that they wouldn't be discouraged. Competitors are good for giving you ideas; for demonstrating market existence (good for raising funds...); for suggesting markets you hadn't thought of.  Complements are always good.<p>Perhaps also, companies that are always launching new products might appreciate it: eg Proctor and Gamble (though in their market, there are only a few competitors and they are well-known...). It might help in industries that are often disrupted - ie high-tech industries. Examples might be the <i>established</i> competitors of YC companies. If you could demonstrate legitimacy, big enterprise might pay a lot (perhaps equivalent to how much it would cost to hire someone to do the same work manually). You can be an arms dealer, and sell to both sides. :-) That's the nature of competition.<p><i>EDIT</i> <a href=""http://www.mirah.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mirah.org</a> hasn't got results yet.

""Excuse me, I'm here to have a meeting with Tim and I'm in a bit of a rush.  I really hate to ask this but I left my presentation at home and I don't know if the presentation laptop will have Internet: will you mind if I quick use your computer to go to Gmail and download it to my USB key?""<p>Relatedly, a white man in a business suit could probably get about as far as the door of the Japanese equivalent of the Oval Office before getting questioned for the first time.

1564654,comment,1560989,1564060,0,0,w00pla,,,">  If you're a white American male,<p>I am not a white American male. I am a young white South African.<p>> Grow up and take responsibility for your own situation.<p>This is a bullshit argument. You say that people who are discriminated against are responsible for their own situation. WTF?<p>If a white person cannot gain entrance into a university (because he is white) or he cannot get a job (government mandated quotas in the private industry and basically a moratorium in the public sector). Here is a simple example: I did really well in my school matric exam (in the top 3 in a province). I applied for over 30 bursaries for which I did not receive a response for an engineering degree. The same companies gave lots of bursaries to black people who cannot complete the degree in 4 years. In other words, they do an extra year of “pre-parationary classes” and then do a 5 year engineering degree (which is usually six). So people spend 6-7 years on a 4 year degree! (I passed mine in 4 years with an 88% average).<p>Luckily my parents dug deep and I could go to university (with difficulty). If they were just a little poorer, I would have been fucked (and would probably be doing manual labour or something).<p>By the way, afterwards I studied received a much more competitive and prestigious bursary to study further overseas. So apparently I was not good enough for SA universities but elite university in a foreign country is OK. That is what I am doing now.<p>What you should also bear in mind is that it is usually white people of lower socio-economic status that is the hardest hit. Not everyone can be an engineer, etc... Discriminatory policies create a lot of poverty among them and create a continual poverty trap. It also seems that there is a lot of hate (among both black and white people) for poor white people. It is even common to use slurs against them (e.g. white trash).",1280632043
