1628659,comment,1628476,1628615,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"""I also had paid internships every summer""<p>From your family's standpoint, the pay you received was probably immaterial compared to value of the experience.  What if you had received two internship offers one summer: (1) A boring but well-paid position, and (2) a really exciting/enriching opportunity that didn't even pay enough to cover your living expenses? Would your family have forced you into #1, or would you have been subsidized for #2?  Given the time and money your parents had already invested in you during the first 20 years of your life in hopes of helping you be a happy and prosperous adult, it wouldn't be rational for them not to hand over, say, $10K to help you out given these circumstances (presuming that your family has accumulated sufficient wealth that the $10K really wouldn't make much difference in their lives).<p>I'm not making some sort of, ""Oh...your rich, so blah..."" sort of comment.  My family would have supported me while I pursued #2 I ended up with well-paid internships each summer, so it didn't matter anyway.  And, I didn't work during the academic calender (sans a few consulting gigs here and there).<p>Kids from poorer families often end-up taking jobs while in school which have a negative NPV for their lives.  Why pay $10's of K per year to go to college and then spend 20 hours/week waiting tables instead of studying?  Is it rational to graduate debt free with a 2.5 GPA?  I was about to claim that these kids take such jobs because there's no way for them to borrow money for living expenses while in school, but this may not be true -- I'm not at all familiar with student loan programs.  Perhaps these kids have an irrational fear of debt?<p>Or, could their fear of debt be rational?  To allow ""middle class"" folks to attend Harvard Business School, the school partnered with Citi to extends well over $40K/year in living expenses debt at a low interest rate.  As an MBA from HBS is quite a ticket to a good income, students have little fear of going into hock.  However, the poorer kids are probably more likely to be working while attending mediocre schools close to their families' homes.  Will their post-college earnings be high enough to make taking on debt rational?  One would hope, but I'm a believer in the ""education bubble.""",1282614125

Mostly that's been x86, but for low power applications it's largely been ARM. As power becomes a more important element, and with ARM relatively more performant, I think we'll see an increasing share of it in what would otherwise be x86 territory, but I don't think we'll see real heterogeneity, unless it's a better competitor to either of these.<p>I see an analogy between x86 and ARM and Porter's generic strategies. ARM is like the cost leadership, with x86 being the differentiation strategy - where the cost is the cost of energy. x86 is able to do a lot more things than ARM, but with higher energy costs.

The vast majority, at least in the US, got there through hard work, and if they're smart enough to accumulate wealth then they're probably smart enough to instill those same values in their children.<p>I'll add a data point:  I come from an upper-middle class background - no butlers, but my parents' house is pretty nice, and we've had some very nice vacations.  My parents started with nothing, but my dad worked ridiculous hours for 20+ years in the finance industry and it paid off.  As for college, my parents paid for 3 years of undergrad and I paid for the fourth (housing, food, tuition, expenses, everything), out of a combination of my own earnings and well-invested savings.  I worked as a TA for four semesters (one of which I TAed two classes), a research assistant for one, and I ran the CS dept. TA lab for one.  I also had paid internships every summer, starting the summer between high school and college.<p>For grad school, my parents paid my tuition (but nothing else) my first quarter, and after that I paid my own way between TAships every quarter, an additional internship during one quarter, and another summer internship.  Oh...and I also started a company halfway through grad school.<p>The only times since in the last 6+ years (I'm 24) that I haven't had a job were my freshman year and the summer between undergrad and grad school.

I can't seem to scare up a reference, but it's at least broadly correct even if I'm off by 10 or 20%. If you don't retire a millionaire in 2030/2040 money, you're going to be in real trouble.

First time was ""Every priority 1 ticket has to be answered within 24 hours"".
Before the SLA we were a cheerful and overworked IT team, doing our best to handle all tickets within reasonable times and with our best quality responses.
Afterwards - We started negotiating priorities, replying ""investigating"" within 24 hours to make sure management doesn't get on our case, and we had lots of not-so-funny jokes about announcing ""love every 38 hours"" SLAs to our spouses.<p>The second time they actually went as far as saying ""This SLA is between marketing, sales and the customer. You don't need to worry about it. Just keep on doing what you always did.""<p>They had to say that, because with our current equipment and processes, offering 99.9% availability to our customers was impossible. Our real availability was an average of 99.5% with some services as low as 97%. Not because we were horrible IT - but because of trade-off decisions we reached in the past together with our management.<p>It didn't help much. Because we didn't trust management not to start holding us to those SLAs at a random moment. Which they did.<p>Again, from a team that did their best to keep servers up, we became expert negotiators of which downtimes ""count"" and which don't. Also, we because very defensive: ""We can't risk upgrading this month, we were already down 13 minutes.""<p>I understand the need to sell to corporates, but I would be very very careful communicating SLAs to my team.",1282612018

I am only 22 and wish much to grow. In those areas where I might not provisionally want to grow, I write a diary, it is a fine way to speculate about the knowledge one has in his own space.<p>Perhaps this is desire speaking more than reason, but in this place more than other I have found people who are of my intellectual level, who are inquisitive, naturally curious to learn about such matters, such as to use the easy example, what matter is made of.<p>So when I suggested, what is wrong with people who engage in orgy sex being protected from HIV, I was not making a point of the kind which seems that people might make, that is of the intention to suggest that it is fine to have orgy sex. I am not fine neither however with orphan kids in Africa being held somehow as angels for whom we must all fight, and ignore the reality which lurks in our street. Sex should be free for all. I do not see how that can possibly be a frowned upon proposition. I do not see why we should be free to put on a hierarchical scale the position that children would occupy with that of sex orgies. I do not see either on a purely theoretical, philosophical, rational or logical manner why such children should attract our sympathy more than the 18 year old naive girl or boy who simply made a mistake. Are we all the sudden putting life on a hierarchical scale?<p>But of course with all the mighty brains that might lurk these pages, such matters deserve no consideration. Down voting is much easier, than inquiring, counter arguing, suggesting alternative views. It is simply easier to censor dissenting views which one hardly understands than put one self in that child like curious position of wishing to learn such as asking well why must it not be like this, well why do you think so.<p>I personally know my opinions, I know my thoughts, I know my reasoning and perception. That is not why I frequent these pages. I come here to learn of other's rational reasoning, to learn of the way others rationally perceive things, to be in that cutting edge, where reason and logic reigns supreme, where emotions is not taken in consideration, where one discusses rather than asserts their authority, where the community discusses in the free spirit of reason.<p>We have a great thing here. It currently is outside of the mainstream eyes, yet influences the ""opinion makers"" for the opinion makers are people of our intelligence. Yet, this is becoming a community of assertions, a community where are found those fallacies men of intelligence know to guard, such as marketers cheating the system, in uniform, each of them starting their title with Why is this so, not quite asking, instead, following it with their opinions, opinions which I have to guard against calling them bluff due to their physical presence in the community.
