Anyone could make a curl request to that /apps/bbc-news/proxy uri and pass whatever URL they wanted to hit via the x_bbc_url http header. Doing this, any request they make would appear to come from the whitherapps.com (or whatever) domain.

Let them dry.<p>Then, take some form of pigment or dye, and with a very fine stylus impregnated with the dye, visually encode the data on the cellulosic sheets using a set of graphemes.  Each grapheme would roughly represent a phoneme in a spoken language.<p>It would take quite a while to encode all that data.  I'd suggest building some type of mechanical to automate the task of transferring dye on to the cellulosic sheets.  I'd also want to bundle these individual cellulosic sheets into stacks of 200-500 for organization's sake.  I'd probably cover them with a more durable material such as animal hide or perhaps a thicker layer of cellulosic material.<p>I'd then take all these bundles of data laded cellulosic material, and I'd build a structure to protect these bundles from the elements.  Developing a cataloging or indexing system for these bundles shouldn't be too hard.  I'm sure it's been done before.<p>Regardless, you could either preserve the materials or let the public have free access to the information.  You'd run the risk of damaging the data, but if you had a mechanical replication system, you could simply make multiple copies of each data set, and ensure the safety of the data that way.<p>Sheets of fibrous, cellulosic material should last several thousand years if kept in the right environment.<p>You know.

I don't put the chair back, but I have two of those rubberized ""keyboard"" wrist supports (the ones that are about 20x3 inches) across the edge of my desk (one for each arm), and I type with the point of my elbows just off the wrist pads, my forearms supported by the base of my forearm just near the elbow.  I found that if I rest the point of my elbow on the wrist pad it's not as comfortable.    Since they are side by side, they stretch the entire length of where I'm going to move my arms, for both using the keyboard and mouse.  And since my arms are supported near the elbow, the natural most effective typing position for my wrists is straight, or what high school typing teachers would call ""up"", <i>not</i> resting on something.

I need something to support the weight of my arm, not change its shape to the contour.  Unfortunately the rubberized ones are getting hard to find.<p>In a pinch, I use rubberized mousepads, which every office seems to have lying around and no one uses.

I think it is a fascinating way for brands to sell products to unsuspecting consumers, but there is no value as a standalone ""Away Message"" platform... that would be the job of something like Facebook status updates, since all of my friends are already connected on there.""<p>Twitter seems better for personal use.  Advertising/commercial use is everywhere, and it's nice to have a tool that's relatively uncluttered where I'm not being ""targeted"".<p>There are several advantages of twitter being ""a standalone 'away message' platform"" over Facebook:<p>•It's simpler (both in its look and its goal). I don't have to worry about applications, games, polls, or whatever else people do on Facebook that isn't communicating a single, focused idea, link, or observation.  To me all that stuff isn't added value, it's just more baggage.<p>•Following can be one-sided, whereas friending is an agreement and is based on a real-life identity.  I don't need to have a pre-existing connection to follow or be followed on twitter.  Because Facebook is based on who you actually are, it doesn't have a ""shit my dad says"" or a ""yelling bird"" or whatever else that's silly and entertaining unless you have that one hilarious friend.",1281279789
