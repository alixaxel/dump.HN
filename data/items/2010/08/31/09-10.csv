If 5 out of 8 people working for me were sometimes good and sometimes bad, I'd worry I am not leading them right. Also, with so many people performing badly, is poor performance now part of your company's culture? What contact do your employees have with each other?<p>Before you let them go, have you analysed what makes the difference between their performance being good and bad? What have you tried to motivate them? Have you asked them if there is anything that would motivate them and if there is anything that is demotivating them?<p>One suggestion though: Are they being given enough direction? No-one likes a micro-manager, but having a couple of clear goals for what to get out of a day does wonders for my productivity. The thing is though, <i>I'm not great at setting that for myself</i>. Working with someone to set that kind of daily target is great. You say you have to nudge them constantly, but I'd argue you are probably an exceptional person (e.g. starting your own company and employing 8 people.)

I did high school in Western Australia, where your university admission is determined by a percentile scaled factoring in your peers' scores, school and other information. It's complex but the end result is a very fair system. However an unfortunate side effect is that your classmates' scores going down makes your score goes up.<p>We found out years after graduation that there were quite a few students who actively hid the amount of study and after-school tuition they did, possibly due to the above incentive. In school they felt like naturally talented geniuses, which made it feel futile to compete.<p>Kids don't really have a clear picture of hard work creating ability, because in their experience they only see talent and potential, not end results.

1648882,comment,1648578,1648578,0,0,csomar,,,"Don't worry, you don't become a professional programmer in one day. It's a long process.<p>I started programming (Qbasic) at the age of 12. My first programs were just some combinations of blocks of code taken from the help document. Until 18, I had been always an amateur programmer. Then Things changed. Programming can be flipped from fun to work. I can get paid to have fun, so why don't do it?<p>I was introduced to the real world and I discovered that my knowledge, as huge as it was (a little from everything) wouldn't really help building the smallest application. I also can't write code on my own. I need another application to copy from or re-use the code. My frustrations began, but they lasted short.<p>I started reading books. My target was Visual C#. I read a book about .Net fundamentals and another one about Visual Studio. I become a better programmer. It did took me months to understand OOP, but I finished by mastering it. And yay! I used collections.<p>I left Visual C# and decided to develop for the web. I planned to learn it from scratch. From the start to the end. First, I need a strong knowledge about the Client Side. That is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The first two are somewhat easy to master and learn. JavaScript is very expressive and can take a while to master.<p>Actually, I felt in love with JavaScript and with it's prototypal and dynamic nature. I'm 19 and I already built 2 scripts that I'm selling on code canyon (I'm working on the third right now ;)) Suddenly while browsing on the web, I found a small niche, that can be valued to $100K/year. It's hidden somewhere and related to JavaScript. No one explored this domain (except low-quality Open Source solutions) I made my researches, grabbed a related domain and making a plan.<p>Learning Programming? Oups! I forgot about it!!!",1283247187
1648881,comment,1648711,1648711,0,0,_delirium,,,"One missing bit, I think, is that the declarative-programming alternative that Prolog represented got somewhat incorporated, piecemeal and in non-logic form, into a lot of mainstream languages and frameworks, which reduced its uniqueness. For data-heavy applications, SQL gradually moved up the application stack from where it had once been, to where more and more ""logic"" was written declaratively in SQL, instead of it being a purely dumb butler of a language whose job was getting things out of cells for you. Parallel to that, SQL's also been gradually incorporating features from Prolog's descendent Datalog that push it towards a more full-featured language in which arbitrary logic can be encoded (recursive queries are one big 1990s addition).<p>Elsewhere, even in AI, production-rule systems gained popularity from the 1980s as a simplified, propositional form of declarative programming, which also lent itself more naturally to state maintenance (asserting/retracting facts, and updating what changes as a result, as the core interaction loop). The focus on expert systems in the 1980s, and the development of the efficient RETE algorithm in 1983 were probably some factors in taking over an area in that in the 1970s one would've done in Prolog, or hand-coded in Lisp. Even today lots of this kind of ""logic"" stuff gets done in Jess or Drools, especially in business-logic, which is something of a success for declarative programming, though not for full-on logic programming.<p>I think a bunch of this kind of thing conspired to make Prolog not nearly as exciting even by the late 1980s as it was in the 70s. Academics moved on, and started focusing on other things. Datalog and other data-querying systems were a big focus for a while: if Prolog wasn't going to take over all programming, well, dammit, at least it was going to take over data querying, where it seemed like a clear win. That did have some impact (modern SQL cribs some features and even algorithms almost directly from Datalog), but it was more in the ""influence"" than ""replace"" sense.<p>Today much of the focus is on answer-set programming (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming</a>), which targets neither large programs (like Prolog) nor large databases (like Datalog), but relatively small programs/databases with complex deduction and constraints (more in the style of solving combinatorial problems). That might be seen as something of a retreat, towards using logic programming for things that were more traditionally done in logic anyway, rather than as a general programming paradigm. There are some logic-programming-in-the-large descendents, like Mercury (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(programming_language)</a>), but AFAIK their communities have always been small. It seems they're a little too hybrid to appeal to theorists, a little too academic-sounding to appeal to real-world types, live in Prolog's shadow, and lack a killer app.<p>One interesting angle is a very recent trend of pushing some declarative-programming ideas directly into mainstream programming languages. LINQ in C# is probably the most interesting one. It's billed as adding something like SQL into C#, but the way it's used as an actual core programming construct (not just a data-retrieval construct), which you can use to write application logic in a declarative rather than either functional or imperative style, has a very logic-programming flavor. This route is, imo, the most promising angle to get anything like logic programming used to build real, large-scale apps: the possibility that a successor to LINQ will add features that move it closer to logic programming seems much larger than the possibility that a Prolog descendent will break through.<p>[Note of course that the above is all my personal take. I'm a grad student using ASP and Prolog as tools in my thesis, so I clearly think they have merit, though I can also see why, when confronted with ""hey we can write this all in Prolog!"", the world's answer might have been, ""maybe we can just take some of the cool parts of Prolog instead?"" If anyone's qualified to answer the ""why did Prolog die?"" question definitively, it sure ain't me. But do I think that some of the above factors played a role.]",1283247120

Object-oriented languages are also generally imperative—the contrasting term is declarative, which purely functional and logic programming languages are (to some extent).<p>Interestingly, given the conclusions reached in the article, both Sterling and Shapiro's The Art of Prolog and Lloyd's Foundations of Logic Programming mention the Japanese fifth generation project as an example of Prolog's impending breakthrough into the mainstream.",1283245731

I'm just aware about the logic class of programming language: imperative (1956, Fortran), functional (1959, Lisp), object-oriented (1972, Smalltalk), logic (1974, Prolog). Some Erlang syntax is borrowed from Prolog, so is Erlang a logic programming language or functional (I always thought Erlang is functional)? What other language is under logic class?",1283245711

Writing feels like work, and promotion like stressful work that I suck at.  The pay for blogging is horrendous, and every reason I gave him that is a problem for his business is a problem for me.  There are a couple of thousand or tens of thousands of people in the startup space, there are a huge number of bloggers publishing at a prodigious rate, and my odds of being Best In The World for it are pretty low.  I mean, we have different beats, but competing against the likes of pg or 37signals on a daily basis does not strike me as a desirable positioning.<p>Consulting makes a much better choice as a backup career.  Clients have huge budgets for provable ROI.  (I do most of my work for Italian restaurants, in the metaphorical sense, rather than folks buying bulk ramen.)  Enough people trust me these days to fill a pipeline to where I like it.  It even might scale if I wanted it to.  Thomas can explain that better than I can.<p>Less stress, less work, better pay, and if I want to continue blogging I can write off the hosting as lead generation on my taxes and get $3 back.  What is not to like.  Well, working several hours in a row for other people on their schedules, which is why I do software.  Still, it makes a good Plan B.",1283245703

These symbols don't represent data structures (arrays, objects) so you can fudge that part.<p>When it clicks then stop using it.  But keep in mind, when you run across something where the logic is confusing, or especially if you can't figure out a clean way to represent the flow, come back to your old friends, and you'll be amazed at how they will guide you.

While I do feel that I've learned a lot, I can't help but think that there's a better way to go about understanding programming languages and concepts. I feel like I'm stuck in some sort of limbo between being a complete beginner and having a solid grasp on whatever I'm trying to learn.<p>I'm familiar with the advice that goes something like this: ""Try to solve a problem that's compelling to you and you'll learn fast"", but I guess I just don't feel like I can even get to the point of being able to even attack whatever problem I think up.<p>Basically, I guess what I'm asking is: What's the most effective method for learning a programming language?",1283245206
