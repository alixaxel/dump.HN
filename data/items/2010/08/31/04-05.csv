When I first discovered Reddit I became a contributor, most of my links got upvotes, one or two even hit the front page.<p>But after a couple months, suddenly every single one my submissions was getting downvoted within the first minute or so of submitting, no exceptions.  Even many of my comments were getting pointlessly downmodded.<p>I figured at best I had pissed off some script kiddie with a downmod bot, at worst a voting ring had begun systematically suppressing competing links.<p>I just read the site for a while after that without submitting or commenting, eventually created a new handle and retired the original, and then discovered subreddits which imho is the best idea ever.  It's not a problem anymore, at least among the subreddits I subscribe to.<p>I <3 reddit, have learned more from people there, esp Proggit and the like, than even my undergrad education, and was one of your recent contributors.  I'm sure the anti-gaming code is significantly more evolved now than it was then.

The course was CS106 which was introduction to programming, a requirement for CS students and some EE majors and some math majors I believe. Technically I was a guest lecturer.  I got my first job as a programmer through one of my professors. He was pretty well connected with several companies in San Diego.<p>SDSU was switching most of its courses to be taught in Java.  They also had MSCE certification courses and were starting Java certification courses.  I had just landed a new job at a local java shop.  My old professor was looking for professionals to teach the new java courses. I was a pretty good developer and my name came up to teach the course (which paid pretty well.)  But he decided that I need some teaching experience and got me to teach the intro to programming course to give me the experience.   I know he had to pull a few strings to make it happen since I was not a grad student and not exactly a seasoned professional.<p>It turned out to be a great experience.  I really enjoyed it.  The pay was horrible.  After preping for the lecture, grading, office hours and the lecture, I think it worked out to ~$12/hour.  Quite a bit less than I was making as a regular developer.  So I only taught the one semester.<p>I know of another guy I used to work with who was a horrible developer.  I mean really bad. I believed he had a masters degree.  But he taught extension courses at UCSD. I think the extension courses have a lot less restrictions on the requirements.  From there he ended up teaching full time at another college, can't remember where.  It was another small one in San Diego.  This might be an option to allow you to teach if they offer extension classes.",1283229059

Dishonesty on the tubes is why so many of us are jaded and believe nothing.<p>Few of the examples said ""Here's a professional infographic pandering to the current pop meme, surrounded by some monetizing ads"", but instead it was ""HERE IS MY FIRST INFOGRAPHIC!"" (always ad free because that's a part of the bait-and-switch meme approach), and once it got boosted the URL turned to a 301 permanent PageRank forward to some spam factory, polluting search engines with garbage.<p>Meme herding itself is really the root cause, though: Once Digg showed a propensity for top N lists, the web became awash with vapid top N lists for everything, humorlessly produced by SEO drones.<p>Not all content follows this shallow, deceptive practice.<p>There is a dating site -- I honestly can't remember which one right now, and am not suppressing their name on purpose -- that keeps releasing compelling analysis data, predictably boosting them to the tops of all of the social news sites. In return for producing interesting content, they get lots of incoming hits and page rank goodness. Their motives are clear as day for everyone, and there is no surreptitious BS.<p>Sidenote: 99% of infographics are terrible.",1283228454

They've found a formula for baiting digg/reddit/etc. users into clicking on chartjunk, and are selling that formula to anyone who will pay: if your college-textbooks site needs some SEO, we'll whip up an infographic about bottled water that you can get linked everywhere. Because we want to inform people about bottled water, are doing serious research on the subject to present a well-thought-out position, because it's even relevant to your site at all, etc.? No, just because it gets clicks, and we'll decide what to put in the chart 100% based on what will get the most clicks, not based on what is actually true about bottled water or anything (I imagine they don't go out of their way to make up stuff, but clearly an interest in bottled water is not their motivator).<p>I agree that linkbait in general has many of those features, but I'd consider most linkbait to be at least a cousin of spam.
