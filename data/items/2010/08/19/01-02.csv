As I see it regardless of whether the Singularity arises or not this century will achieve a rate of progress which is incomparable to anything we have ever seen before. To get this in perspective just consider that in the nineteenth century more technological breakthroughs were made than in all of the nine centuries preceding it. Then in the first twenty years of the twentieth century, we saw more advancement than in all of the nineteenth century combined. In this century we will achieve 1000 times more than we achieved in the whole 20th century which was itself a period of progress never before seen. Whether we reverse engineer the brain or not the merging of human and machine intelligence is an inevitability because you only need to look at how attached we are to our iPhones and Blackberry’s to realise that we will ultimately be unable to resist moving increased processing capability directly inside the body.  The consequence of that is massively increased capability whatever way you look at it.",1282182847

Being able to do this has saved more than one traveling companion from disaster...folks who had left their laptops behind in lieu of a portable HD for offloading their pictures.<p>They're fast enough to play some old games (I like to play Sim City 4k on mine), but it plays lots of casual games like plants vs. zombies ok.<p>or watch some ripped movies, pretty much any ripped DVD will play fine on it (I also have an external drive I can hook up, but I usually leave that at home). I have usually a dozen or so movies on mine at any one time. I rarely turn the hotel TV on when I travel.<p>I also have about 10GB of old 78s ripped to mp3 on it for background music when I can't get on the web (<a href=""http://78records.cdbpdx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://78records.cdbpdx.com/</a>).<p>It's fast enough to run emulators for anything <= SNES. For a while I had mine running as a portable Amiga, which was hot.<p>It's small enough I literally can't tell if it's in my backpack or not, and it's so small it takes up the same space as a book.<p>Oh, and I have a few thousand e-books on mine (and comics CBZ, CBRs).<p>And I have some music production software on it, it's good for most things so long as I don't rely on too many real-time effects or push the multi-channel stuff too hard. But I've cranked out a couple decent tunes on it.<p>It can, in a pinch, act as an emergency swap out for a main computer. My wife's computer died in an electrical storm, and for a couple weeks, she just hooked my netbook up to her monitor and ran it at 1680x1050 to get some MS-Office work done. She plugged a USB keyboard and mouse into the available slots and still had another left over for her thumb drive she drags back and forth to work. That basically saved her job over one particularly grueling project. It wasn't super speedy, but she got her work done.<p>I'd imagine taking it to school would be perfect because it's so small it fits on a regular student desk with space left over for a mouse.<p>You could probably travel with one of these <a href=""https://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/usb-gadgets/c609/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thinkgeek.com/computing/usb-gadgets/c609/</a> and get some multi-monitor goodness from it while on the road.<p>Overall, I'd say it's probably the best $300 I've ever spent on a piece of consumer hardware. I do a ton of traveling and my netbook has literally been around the world with me half a dozen times. I've entirely stopped taking my regular laptop with me as I found I simply didn't use it and it felt super bulky in comparison (plus I couldn't figure out what to do with it when I was out of the hotel room since I couldn't fit it into a safe).",1282182805

It's more just government subsidies in these specific areas, which end up distorting prices and incentivizing certain behaviours.

1616243,comment,1615524,1615524,0,0,keeptrying,,,"These comments are probably true. And I say this from experience having worked at a large corporation for the last 6 years. Yes it might be one or two guys writing negative comments but it'll also be someone who has been really wronged and cannot let go of the pain. But you can believe that there would have been others who were also wronged during this guys tenure who are just too meek (as we engineers usually are) to say it out in public.<p>Reasons why its probably true:<p>A) The comments by themselves would not have been enough to fire the guy. There must have been enough complaints by their own staff. In my corporation we managed to get our manager fired in the same way. Everyone complained to HR. Though it took like a year. This guy actually had me on ""communications performance plan"". It was right out of dilbert.<p>B) Its very very difficult to be a good manager.<p>This is because its easier to play the political game than it is to actually be a leader with morals, the technical chops and great communication/relationship skills. So most people just kiss ass and shit on their reports and climb up the ladder.<p>The higher you go in a corporation the harder it is to be a good manager. Because the amount of communiction/relationship/leadership skills necessary really rises exponentially rather than linerally. I say this from my experience of having worked in one corporation for 6.5 years. I have had MANY managers but only one good manager.<p>C) Sucky indian managers (selection bias). But yes there are many.<p>Now, I'm indian but I have to say that most indians SUCK at being managers (I've been a sucky indian manager myself :) . I've tried to figure out why and the only ponits I can think of are :<p>1. In tech companies there are a lot of indians and therefore a lot of \nindian managers.<p>2. Most managers suck at what they do. This because to be a good manager you have to be able to lead your employees but also be able to take orders from your own manager. Also you never get real world ""practice"" before your stuck into the role.<p>3. An indian on a H1-B is going to try harder to keep his job than one that doesnt and I think thats why they do downright deceitful things to look good to their own managers. Ie they become hardline task masters.<p>I've known quite a few bad indian managers. Infact if I get an indian manager the first thing I'll do that day is start looking for another job. The manager might turn out okay but I'm that disillusioned with them. Especially new ones.<p>PS: At the end of it all I did change. :) I got really huge pay increases for my best engineers and saved 1 from getting fired.",1282182594

Just a small team.<p>Even when a plan says ""unlimited,"" I can promise you multiple people in the same company are buying overlapping services.  Why? Because folks want their own username/password/account management. (Plus they probably aren't even aware somebody else in their giant company is using it. I can pretty much guarantee they aren't IT-driven purchases. Not that they shouldn't be.)<p>As somebody else pointed out, employees can buy pretty much anything  up to $1000 without approval from a higher up.<p>When things truly are being used by an entire large company, (driven by IT) they usually have some sort of account management/identity system that can hook into the company's own system (almost always Active Directory).  Things like Google Apps or Salesforce, where you really don't want overlap (because you want to manage groups and permissions) have this capability AND don't have tend to have unlimited plans. (Unless specifically negotiated, you pay per seat.)<p>(In the future, OpenID or whatever evolves from its principles may replace it. But in the enterprise, SAML/AD/LDAP is kinda it for now.)<p>SaaS offerings that talk to these systems and are sold to Fortune 5000 corps typically start at $250,000.  Somebody much smarter than I has outlined this strange enterprise price gap ( < $1000 or > $250,000).  It was possibly Joel Spolsky. It's not a crazy theory, it's real. (As somebody else in the thread pointed out, anything above $1000 requires approval and lawyers, and is a really expensive for you as a vendor to deal with this for anything less than $250,000).<p>Tangent:<p>If you're a SaaS developer and want to sneak into the enterprise, get into Google Apps Marketplace.  If you hook your app into Google Apps, any company already using Google Apps can use your app with a little less work (for them) than if you were just a regular web app.<p>As of summer 2010, there are about 30 Million Google Apps ""premiere""(paying or enhanced) users.",1282180410

There is a huge cash (grey) economy that means that income tax, the primary revenue raising tool for most Western economies, is useless.<p>If you go into a taverna with your family and blow 100 euros on a big meal, the bill will arrive and only cash will be accepted. At the end of a busy night that brought in maybe 2,000 euros, the proprietor will report to the tax authority an income of 200 - hey, slow night, eh.<p>Now I realise this may be a struggle for those of you with a certain kind of politics, but believe me - a lack of an effective income tax is a terrible thing. For starters, the state needs revenues somehow - so since they can't reliably tax income, they have to tax secondary things - which unfortunately are things like fuel tax, and goods taxes that hit the poor much more than the rich. Hence a lot of the social tension that you see in the news.<p>This is why the swimming pools are a big deal. Yes it may sound insane that anybody wants to tax pools - but when the person who owns the beautiful pool in the house by the ocean claims he only earned $10,000 last year, and you are unable to actually bust him on such an atrocious claim, then taxing his easy-to-find pool is the only thing you can do.<p>This is a country than until very recently didn't even have a land registry; yes, the state had no idea who owned a piece of land.<p>The point is that Greece is a bad example to use in a debate of fiscal policy, because it works nothing like you US/UK/{Insert your big Western economy here} people think it does.",1282179719
