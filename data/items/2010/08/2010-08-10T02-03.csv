1590265,comment,1587389,1589600,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> You said engineers were not prisoners.<p>I would be willing to bet you that engineers working on the Typhoon class submarines were not prisoners.  In general engineering was an esteemed and respected profession. Think lawyers and doctors in US. These are all general statement relating to the situation in Soviet Union based on a personal experience.<p>Your comment made it sound like ""no, that is _wrong_ most engineers were prisoners"".<p>That is just simply wrong. There we some engineers who were also prisoners. But most of them were not.<p>Those engineers that worked on building submarines were doing very well. That was a very prestigious job. Again think about someone being a stock broker or a corporate lawyer in US.<p>> The Wikipedia article states that. Do you really believe that Khruschev, just because he chose to oust Stalin, gave up on such a convenient source of scientific labor?<p>Alright the history of the Soviet Union might have been obscured and covered in secrets but you forgot one important thing -- the Soviet Union fell apart. It lasted only 70 years and people from the 50s are still alive.  So no matter how much the Soviets tried to rewrite the history, as long as there are still millions of eye witnesses it is just not possible.<p>>  I have no idea where you found anything in my post about American moral superiority.<p>You are right, you didn't say it. I put those words in your mouth because I thought you implied it. The reason I thought that is that your perception of the situation in the ex-Soviet Union, especially as far as the naval engineering goes, is completely wrong. Being that you refuse to admit that it is wrong, leads me to believe that you are just drumming up the same boring Cold War propaganda that we've heard before from the Americans -- stuff like ""in Soviet Union everyone was in a Gulag"", ... , ""any progress was made just because people were prisoners and forced to work"",... and so on.<p>I am not excusing or romanticizing the ex Soviet empire. I am glad it fell, I didn't like. I want to be able to write whatever crap I want online without the fear of someone knocking on my door and so on.  BUT painting everything with a broad black brush is just wrong. Life in the Soviet Union was not hell, people were not crying on the streets, everyone had their basic needs taken care of, crime was law and so on. No matter how much we want to hate it, we cannot re-write that, because that as well would just as dishonest and wrong.",1281408410

This hurts new companies just as much as new homebuyers; here's a 2003 press release from Shoerenstein co. grumbling about how they pay $16/sqft in downtown San Francisco while most of Disneyland is taxed at 5c/sqft although the land is worth about 7x more than that figure suggests.<p>Property taxes are reassessed periodically, but prop 13 limits increases in tax to 2%/year, so for those who hold real estate it takes 36 years for the tax to double in value even if the price of the land goes up much faster or inflation is high. Back in 79 stagflation was a pressing economic problem, so the net effect of Prop 13 was to reduce property taxes for existing homeowners - inflation was ~8% then, so a 2% tax increase cap meant your property tax was going down by 6% in real terms.",1281408378

But why does limited bandwidth mean it's ok to prejudice services?  Why does that make it ok that YouTube can purchase prioritized service over GlueTube?  Doesn't having a limited resource make it <i>more</i> important to share that resource around rather than <i>less</i> important?  Isn't that the way it works everywhere else (eg: limited water supplies usually mean we regulate the price and ensure Grandma doesn't have to pay way more than BigCompany or we know that Grandma is getting no water).<p>The ""still-developing nature"" of the service?  I still don't get it.  If anything the immature nature of the services mean that the nascent network needs more protection, not less.   We just don't know how it is going to evolve - ok fine - but doesn't uncertainty counsel more caution rather than lack of caution?   We can always relax rules later if they are determined to be harmful.   It will be very hard to wind back a non-network-neutrality situation once that has emerged and established itself if we determine it is harmful.<p>Perhaps I can buy these arguments if they are made sufficiently, but there just isn't enough detail here to make a sound logical link.

I work in this kind of environment, where I need to collaborate with about a half-dozen (non-software) engineers on the product design, and working with them when they are/I am offsite is much more difficult than when we are all in the office. I inevitably spend most of the day reading and writing e-mails and on conference calls when this is the case, and most of the day working on the product when it is not. Five minutes sitting around a whiteboard in person dissecting a problem can often replace an hour-long conference call or thousands of words of e-mail correspondence.",1281407008

We think our approach is a lot better: by putting the tool in the browser, we make campaign management painless.
