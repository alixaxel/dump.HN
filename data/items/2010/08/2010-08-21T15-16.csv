The attention paid to synthetic fitness landscapes, for example, is also a positive sign that that many researchers do care about issues of comparison and analysis.<p>(That said, I obviously believe that the field can and must do much better---and, since it relies so heavily on empirical evidence, its need for consistent methodology is somewhat higher.)",1282406332

If a user is on IE vs Safari vs Firefox, it will perform completely different - which is extremely important when the javascript that is executing renders something to the screen. Users have very little wiggle-room for what they consider ""snappy"".<p>IMO, javascript should only be given HTML blocks from the server when rendering larger, more complex partials. This is because if you do it client side (maybe to save the server from rendering HTML and the round trip), you have skattered your view from server-page rendering into javascript CODE. You can test page-renders on the back end, but you need to run a full document emulator (which one, mind you?) to test anything rendered in javascript. I can't count the number of times something in the UI has changed on the backend and we don't find out the javascript fails until later.<p>I understand the ""JS for everything"" movement, but I'd be more inclined to bring Ruby into the browser. Javascript is syntax-heavy (especially when creating strings), hard to test, develops slowly, and doesn't provide stack-traces or logs in the event you need to provide end-user support when something goes wrong.<p>Javascript in my experience is best when used as a conduit - not a swiss army knife.",1282405084

There really isn't that much to them, in my opinion, but every time I encounter them in the wild, they're never implemented correctly, with the variance ranging from really, really wrong to just sort of off. XMPP is the closest to correct, but they still screwed up in that a user's connection to an XMPP server is under one namespace, and a component is done under another, yet an <iq> packet with no namespace qualification is supposed to be treated as the same packet in both, despite being two different packets. (I would accept simply acknowledging that they are the same somewhere, but I've never found it.)<p>Some people use the namespaces in what appears to be a decorative manner. Some people mandate that the prefix be a certain thing <x:tag xmlns:x=""thing""> works while <y:tag xmlns:y=""thing""> doesn't, proving they're doing it wrong under the hood. Some things get it right with xmlns:*, but don't understand what the bare xmlns itself means, so they only trigger namespace logic if there's a colon in the tag. I've seen cases where the namespace is declared, then used out-of-scope like it's a global declaration or something. I'm still waiting to encounter the standard or software that actually uses them correctly. And despite this listing of wrong answers it really isn't that complicated....",1282403532
