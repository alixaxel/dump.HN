I did not get as much from it as I do from most of the In Our Time episodes.  Having just one person to interview does not seem to lead to the same quality of discussion as the panels of experts tha Melvin finds.  I am not saying every IOT is a gem, but I learned from and enjoyed IOT more.  But, I have listened to most of the IOT episodes and I can't get any more back episodes.  They now hide IOT behind Flash and I have better sense than to install that program.\nGood day",1280883591

Not to mention that the economic difficulties of collectivism actually preceded the atrocities. The Soviet Union found out extremely early on that centralized economies don't work. During the first wave of collectivization, the economy collapsed and millions starved. (This is on top of the economic difficulties already afforded by the war and revolution.) Lenin was forced to institute the NEP which was a limited free market system in order for the economy to recover. The purges themselves were responses to the failures of collectivization. They targeted scapegoats such as the Kulaks (who, if you take Soviet policy as any kind of guide, were a sort of fictional minority group,) in order to distract from the deeper problems with the system. You can actually poke through the early Soviet economic history and see a pattern of attempted collectivization, famine and revolts, loosening of market controls, and finally recovery of the economy. The history of the Soviet Union is actually a pretty strong condemnation of extreme collectivism.<p>It's not like the USSR was unique historically. China, Vietnam, and North Korea also attempted similar systems. Of the three, two have effectively admitted defeat and are now pursuing progressively free-market systems while the third hasn't, and is a Hell-hole as a result.",1280882901

1573301,comment,1571933,1571933,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Discussing whether college education is worth it is an inherently controversial topic here on HN, I think, and here's why.<p>First, because most would agree that getting degrees in a technical field are more justified and warranted than non-technical fields. So you're going to get two totally opposite conclusions from the folks dissing $100k history degrees versus the folks praising $70k electrical engineering degrees.<p>Secondly, software and business degrees are probably among the two fields where you can arguably gain the exact same knowledge and skills outside of college, free or very close to it, and at your own pace, and be just as qualified to work in industry. Unlike say medicine or chemistry or physics, etc. But here on HN software and business are probably two of our top most interested fields among readers. So we know a lot about these fields in particular. And the readers here should be very aware how easy it is to access and use free and independent resources and techniques to teach themselves in the areas of software and business. But with software and business in particular we have two camps, each further split into sub-factions, and they are all essentially right when it comes to their positions. Yes, having college education is better than not. Yes, college is too expensive. Yes, you can learn most things on your own. Yes, having that piece of paper WILL help you in the long term. No, of course you don't actually need it (with exceptions like doctors, etc.) All of these positions <i>seem</i> in conflict, but they're not, and that's where the controversy comes from. Because <i>everybody</i> is right.",1280882849

I also think this is a view which is common among people who don't know the subject very well and is similar to to what has been used to explain why women couldn't do other things which are now commonplace.<p>I think essentialism is problematic as a concept because of it's different usages and I only used it because it was featured in the wiki. I much more comfortable talking about sex and gender. Sex being your biological properties and gender being your cultural or socially constructed identity. I see a lot of argument offering flaws in the sex or gender of women as explanation, but not very many considering the flaws in tech culture.<p>I'm not saying there aren't differences in biology between women and men, I just think these are grossly overshadowed by the difference in gender. I also believe gender to be variable. For example I believe encouraging women to take risks, e.g. with an startup incubator, could change their social role even if it would be ""based in"" biology (which I don't think it is in this case).<p>For the record I do think these things should be discussed, I just wished the discussions were better.

1573265,comment,1570694,1572486,0,0,pphaneuf,,,"I think what he's saying is that it should be pretty easy to change between poll, epoll, and ""superpoll"", as you can easily abstract a common interface. Then, you could worry about the performance of that particular bit only when you encounter it, and use your time arguably more effectively on actual feature needed to productionize Mongrel2 better.<p>I sort of agree with him, except with an important detail: this question is basically about prioritization of your time, and I'd say that this is nobody's business but yours! You can optimize memcpy() all day, for all I care. ;-)<p>There's one aspect where you'd be quite right to do some investigation before implementing: if the outcome changes the interface you'd need to implement.<p>For example, here's an hypothesis: using epoll's edge-triggered mode could drastically reduce the number of events (since you only get an event when an fd becomes readable/writable the first time, instead of every time it's in that state). Since epoll is O(N) on the number of events returned (not on the number of fds that are currently readable/writable), you'd lower the effective ATR a whole lot. In fact, a really busy server would have fewer events, since a readable fd would stay that way for longer if data is received at a great rate (the write-side story might be less brilliant). You'd also have to do much fewer calls to epoll_ctl, since you could just stop caring about the reading side while you're trying to write the last batch of data on the other side (no need to remove it from the interest set, you won't get events for it). You only need to set it when flipping from read to write, and the other way (after receiving/sending headers and bodies).<p>Now, if that's true, that's a big deal, because now you have to change your design a fair bit. You have to remember that an fd is readable until you get EAGAIN from read() yourself, so there's some more state management, moving that fd from one list to another, etc. Finding out that this would be a million times faster (or slower!) now would save you a ton of work, either way.<p>But finding whether poll or epoll is faster, or an hybrid solution with the same interface? Meh, it could wait.<p>(about my hypothesis, that's actually what Davide Libenzi designed epoll for, which might explain some of the weirder bits)",1280882128

All of the super active projects are flooded with developers, and everything else is just a single developer doing his own thing.<p>The best way to get involved is to think about what annoys you when you use the computer. Do you find the notification system to be annoying? Do you wish your mail client had better filtering? Find something that annoys you, and then try and fix it. You don't even have to submit a patch your first time doing this. Just get the source code for the application, and take a look around. See if you can identify where the code is that does what you think should be approved. If it looks easy, take a stab at it, and test it out. If it looks difficult, file a bug report. Ask the developers if one of them is willing to mentor you on the bug. At this point, you'll get one of two responses:<p>1. They'll tell you no. A lot of projects have developers that won't have time, or won't want to deal with reviewing your unpolished code.<p>2. They'll tell you yes. Then you can be happy and work on an OSS project.<p>If you're looking for bugs/features that have mentors available, check out some of the projects on launchpad.net, especially ones associated with Ubuntu. There is a large community of developers there that have specifically signed up to mentor certain bugs.",1280880092
