1648130,comment,1647762,1647988,0,0,marcamillion,,,"1) I went back and forth on that one. The idea behind that, is that it gives a slight tease into how the functionality will be in the full app. As in, you will be able to click the 3-squares, and it changes the view (see the screenshot with 3 images side by side), and the same will happen with the 4-view. I had thought about leaving it out, but figured I would leave it in for some amount of intrigue. Sounds like in your case that turned to frustration though, which was not was intended.<p>2) I think I should probably reword the copy. The arrow keys don't work yet. In the final version they will though. Clicking the arrow icons are the only thing that works. In terms of the ends, the arrow icons should fade when there are no more images on that side. Perhaps I should make it fade more, to be more obvious that the button has been disabled.<p>3) Valid point. It is a shade of light-grey, but maybe it will look better as white.<p>In terms of the shipping, I was hesitating even putting out the 'coming soon' page. Essentially it is just a coming soon page, with a bit of information which acts like a teaser. I decided to give in and just release the coming soon page, because I want to get feedback.

In square tanks, this causes many species to get stuck in the corners where the water is stagnant.<p>Also, this means that they can't fight the current and generally get sucked into the filter intake. At the same time, they need strong current (see the comment about them getting stuck in stagnant areas) so you need a filter with a strong intake.<p>Some species, like moon jellies, all you need to do is diffuse the intake. You can see a section in the video where in the background they demonstrate a filter with the intake buried under a layer of marbles.<p>For other species, you need a specially-shaped tank called a 'kriesel'. (Do an image search for 'kriesel jellyfish' for some examples.) These tanks are shaped like a hockey puck standing on its edge, and move the water in a circle, so that no area is stagnant. Also, a water current blows <i>across</i> the filter intake, so the jellies get pushed aside instead of being sucked in.<p>Fun fact: The big jellyfish display tanks in Monterey Bay aquarium are actually oval-shaped kriesels with current blowing down both sides, and back up the center. That's why the jellies always seem to be upside-down--they're facing into the current in the center of the tank. :-)<p>I'd also disagree with the claim that jellies don't need any ""exotic care"": They're physically very fragile, and you have to be very careful to avoid damaging them when you clean the tank. They also require special food (notice that you're supposed to order special food from this guy) and high water quality, not to mention the special tanks already mentioned.",1283217528

1648109,comment,1646562,1647409,0,0,alanh,,,"You are so close.<p>The key differences between iOS versions and Android versions, as far as branding:<p>1. A major iOS release always coincides with a hardware revision, and are available at least one hardware revision back. Always. Android OS upgrades are not correlated with hardware revisions at ALL, and the latest hardware from one manufacturer (Dell, case in point) may be 16 months and several major versions out of date!<p>2.  Apple advertises the shit out of new phones & new features (again, they coincide). When have you EVER seen advertising mentioning new Android features? When have carriers EVER touted Android, the OS, much less its version number?<p>3. (Major) There is no NEED for an Apple fan to know iOS version. Buying an iPhone is buying the latest iOS version. Existing users are told via iTunes that they can update their phone with new software (an iOS upgrade, but they don’t even need to know it’s called that).<p>4. (Bonus) The different manufacturer & carrier branding ""enhancements"" to Android muddy the water. Now you have two axes of ""versioning"": The fork, and the version number. Not so with iOS. (The iPad is out of sync, but this should be resolved before it’s much more than 6 months old.)",1283217481
