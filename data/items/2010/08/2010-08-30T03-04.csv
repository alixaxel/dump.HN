What you're offering the startup community is speculation.  What you're suggesting is plausible, but you haven't really backed it up with logic suggesting it's probable.  Startups need more than the opinions of a few disgruntled competitors to base their decisions off of.<p>Think about it.  There are two possibilities:<p>1)  Facebook is trying to ensnare startups into its web of twisted lies so it can destroy them.<p>2)  Facebook is just trying to work out a mutually beneficial deal with startups that want to leverage their technologies.<p>While #1 is possible, you have to admit that #2 is the more likely situation.

Here is what he says:<p>""And if you think there's much difference between JavaScript and C, you're dreaming. Or between JSON and XML or plain text files. These are gratuitous reinventions.""<p>Bear in mind that he is taking a very high level view here, and think about what he's saying again.  Are not JSON and XML, fundamentally, simply better ways to put structured data into text files with formats everyone can agree on?  Sure, they are better approaches than what preceded them (CSV? random ad-hoc formats?), but fundamentally, if I said the previous sentence to a programmer who gone into a coma in 1985 and just now woke up, wouldn't they understand it pretty quickly?<p>As for JavaScript and C, well, the syntax is C-like, and you add closures, a class system, and some standard scripting language features like built-in containers and a slack typing model, as far as I can tell from coming up to speed on it recently.  Wouldn't this stuff be familiar to someone who'd learned and coded in a number of different languages in their career?  Surely with a few examples to follow they could be up to speed quickly.<p>Now, of course he's exaggerating, and venting a bit as well.

Foursquare and Twitter have enough users and industry clout that they can hold their own. If you're just starting on an idea, maybe you're getting a little bit of momentum, it might be tempting to talk to someone at Facebook and see if they will help you.<p>But… It's easier and less risky for Facebook to just implement your idea themselves. If they want a feature for their users, why depend on some little startup that may or may not fail? I don't think they're going out of their way to steal ideas. I think they are trying to maximize their own success. We could call it a lack of morals, but I think it's subjective which is why we have these debates.<p>Still, you probably should try to think about it from Facebook's perspective and be realistic about your position of leverage before you approach them with an idea.",1283140034

Some things will be absorbed more readily than others. Foods are not all equal. People differ in significant ways both longer and short term. We don't all have the same mix of intestinal floura to help with digestion.  Some foods may help/hinder getting calories/nutrients from others.  Efficiency no doubt is higher when the food is taken in throughout the day instead of mostly at once.  Even chewing better makes some difference.  And other aspects of body chemistry, such as stomach acidity level no doubt have an influence.<p>I read of a U.N. worker working to help people with serious health problems in very poor nations.  To get a fast inexpensive benefit a comparison was made of healthy/unhealthy people with similar (limited) food access and exposure to environmental hazards.  The conclusion was that those who spread a given amount of food out through the day got more nutrition that those who ate it all at once.  Of course some things are absorbed very easily (like our corn syrup), but it's easier to disrupt absorption of fats and heavier things.<p>I'd been taught that it was better to delay most liquids to the end of a meal, so that stomach acids would be more effective for breaking things down.  Eat most of the heavier items first, shifting towards veggies and fruit then liquids.<p>Doing the opposite may cause weight loss (seems better to say less gain), but I think most consuming a significant amount of liquid first are apt to feel uncomfortable, especially with higher fat meals, as they're not handled as well.  Eating a patty melt or other greasy food after a lot of water or coffee always had me feeling much worse on the road afterward than the same amount of everything in the reverse order.  It's better to eat less than to make digestion less efficient.<p>My summary: It's the water reducing the acidity that made the difference with constant calorie input, but it's better to eat less than to make digestion less efficient like that.",1283138660

Quite simply, large technology companies push ""innovation"" that has little actual value to the public at large. They do this to create barriers to entry so that smaller companies who devote less than 100% of their resources to keep up with the technology that the big companies champion (i.e. they devote some resources to sales, marketing, creating a business) get marginalized.",1283138458

These are gratuitous reinventions.</i><p>Even when these statements seem to be true. Don't train yourself to think like this. It isn't going to help.<p>Yes, people -- especially the young, but the old as well -- go over the same ground a lot in software. That's called <i>practice</i>.<p>It's partly a generational thing: New generations need to learn from mistakes by making some of those mistakes; the process of having your elders lecture you about the mistakes is great, and can save you valuable time, but it is imperfect. Some things you just have to experience for yourself.<p>But it's mostly an evolutionary thing. We reinvent because the environment keeps changing, especially in computing, which has been rocked by epochal changes over the course of the last forty years. (Take out your iPhone and compare it to the machines and networks in use in 1970. Then compare the <i>owners</i> of modern smartphones to the owners of machines and networks in 1970.) The reinvented thing never turns out quite the same as the original, and those differences -- many of which look like accidents, some of which <i>are</i> in fact accidents -- are usually where the progress can be found. The new tool fits the new problem better than the old tool because it evolved in the presence of the new problem.",1283138432

I suspect anyone who chooses to use IP video exclusively will be paying significantly more for broadband over the next few years. The cable/telcos will calculate how much revenue they're losing on video subscribers and overlay that data on top of their transfer caps to break even. The upside is it will probably still end up saving people money. Even if broadband prices increase 20-30% being able to buy only the content you want to watch will be a savings. It might also encourage more responsible TV watching. Who's going to leave the TV on for 12-16 hour stretches if the meter is running the whole time?

1645272,comment,1645125,1645125,0,0,teilo,,,"I love Paul Carr, but he's wrong on this one. He may indeed love his publisher, but I have seen, far too often, struggling authors fighting with their publishers just to maintain control over their own works, much less get proper remuneration. Certainly, the problem is not as bad as it is in the music industry, but unless you are a fabulously successful author, you essentially enslave yourself to a publisher, and give up the copyright to your own creative works.<p>Sorry, but the world is changing. It hasn't yet hit the publishing industry nearly so hard as it has hit the recording industry, but it will. Two things in particular almost guarantee it:<p>First the digital revolution. The Kindle / Nook / etc., are not fads anymore than the iPod was a fad. The publishing world is going digital.<p>Second, the publishing world will always have real ink and paper books (this is my industry, BTW) - but the technology is shifting rapidly toward print-on-demand. Lulu.com, with their fleet of Xerox iGen presses and web-to-bindery workflow has led the way giving everyone the ability to publish hard and soft covers one at a time, and make a profit doing so. I am already seeing mainline publishers doing similar for older works which are not economical to print on conventional presses. These works used to go out of print. Now they are being made available once more, because the publishers suddenly are able to print them at a profit, even if it is just one book for a single customer. But ironically, the more they embrace this technology, the more readily available it will be to smaller and smaller shops.<p>Self-publishing - long an expensive proposition - is quickly becoming the norm for new authors, and it is only a matter of time before the marketing of such books will move to the web. Authors already tend to form their own communities, critiquing one another's works and encouraging them to improve and advance their art. The ability to do this on the web gives them a natural platform from which to market their works to a worldwide audience, without a publisher of any sort playing middle-man.",1283138200

What they don't realize, but what is common knowledge here at HN, its that their ideas are cheap, implementation is what counts, and it looks like the details of the successful implementation will be partially or fully on your shoulders.  The more you put into it, the more they get out of it, but you'll still be payed the same, and quite possibly, at the end, if they achieve any success, they will think it was all their doing.<p>What do HN contractors think of such a situation, and are their any guidelines or best practices to follow?<p>I'll throw some things out there, but not endorsing anything:<p>.5. Avoid, like the plague, any ""I have an idea for a web app"" jobs.<p>1.  Insisting that any ""big ideas"" come from the client, and the contractor just keeps his nose to the grindstone, and keeps quit on bigger issues (user experience, existing competition, ""feature or startup?"", virility, scalability, etc).<p>2.  Equity.  But I don't think you can just answer a job ad on craigslist and say I work for 30 bucks an hour and a piece of the action, or can you?<p>3.  Giving your absolute all, knowing that any success will result in more work from this particular client, as well as any referrals.<p>4. Telling the client what they need is more of a ""consultant"" than contractor, which you can be, to guide them to the most successful completion possible, but it will cost them more.<p>5a. Accept work from clients that are in over their heads, will probably get nowhere, but will pay you, build them a quality web app that nobody will ever use, but don't keep yourself up nights working about things like fantastic user experience, twitter integration, etc.<p>5b.  Work for those idiots who say they want a ""facebook clone"" and use facebook as the final spec, don't innovate, and make sure you get payed.<p>6. Work for a little while, wait until the client realizes he's way over his head without you, and then make a sweeter deal.<p>I hope I'm not looking greedy, that's not my intention or how I feel about it, I'm perfectly willing to be the best contractor possible at competitive price, and wish my clients the best success they can have, I'm more interested in not being taken advantage of.<p>Web app contracting is so wide open.  You can be hired to add a comment section, or you can end up making success or failure decisions.<p>Contrast it with other job descriptions.  Somebody might own a muffin shop, and they put an ad in the paper for somebody to help bake the muffins.  Because most everybody in society has an understanding in muffin baking and an expectation of whats involved, that job ad description is clear.  Contrast that with another ad like ""need somebody to help me bake muffins, we need to figure out the best recipe, develop a unique and memorable brand, and create a marketing plan, and hopefully later expand to other locations.""  In the world of muffins, that last ad description is arguably for a cofounder, but ""need help with the development of a web application"" could describe anything from CRUD to CTO.<p>Whoops sorry this was so long, I didn't realize until I submitted, since I was typing into that little box :)",1283137952
