Parents want to send their kids to ""the good school"" getting the better grades, with better facilities or whatever. Not all parents in an area can do this, there isn't enough room. As the good school gets fuller, it takes more of the cream and the other schools suffer. But this school is leaching the money away from other schools too as the richer parents that help to contribute time and resources and money move to the ""good school"". Ultimately the other schools aren't getting the pupils they need to run properly and suffer incredibly. The one school gets better the others worse.<p>>- Each school is directed entirely by the parents, with no interference from government bureaucracy.<p>There are many areas of running a school that can be made more efficient by using local government departments. Paying employees, insurance, grounds-keeping, building maintenance, healthcare provisions, utility purchasing, school meal provision, etc., can all be run more efficiently with a local grouping of schools rather than individual schools fighting it out for themselves. Do you know who is good at administrating such groups? Local government.<p>Indeed things like creating syllabuses and setting exams can too be streamlined by cooperation across schools.<p>>- Each school gets $X per enrolled student.<p>I'm assuming here that you're not allowing x to vary from school to school.

Maybe businesses would also have to pay the fair tax on their purchases of capital goods, but they can offset those taxes with credits from taxes they collect further down the line?  So if a farmer spends 100k on a tractor and never sells anything, then he has to pay taxes on that tractor.
