The only place they come close is a late 90's huge disk arrays, but random access to SSD arrays are amazing and once you start looking at things like L2 cache bandwidth old mainframes start looking anemic.<p>Edit: An 1980 IBM 3081 could access up to 32 megabytes of main memory.   A 5400-series ""Harpertown"" can have 24 megabytes of cache.  So Modern CPU cache memory vs Mainframe main memory is not an unfair comparison.  But that's just overkill the real shocker is 3081 had less bandwidth to it's registers than many modern computers have to it's local network.

Also, altavista definitely wasn't the only player. Even today, with google as established as it is I'm pretty sure there are at least several hundred people involved in building new search engines. Whether one of them replaces google at any point in time remains to be seen, but it's definitely not classed as a 'hopeless problem'.<p>As for the banking bit. You are missing my point, nobody builds a bank <i>because of the technology</i>, people found new banks <i>because of the money</i>. If that means adapting old, tried and true technology to jump trough new hoops then that's a cost of business. Bankers are conservative by nature, not because they like it but because it makes very good business sense when you're a bank. It's no coincidence that banks, insurance companies and governments are the areas where the mainframe is still dominant.<p>I'm really not sure what kind of services you could offer with a 'new' software stack that you could not offer with the old one. Bank transfers are routinely done in seconds between banks, you can pay with everything from credit cards to mobile phones and computers, they seem to have done a remarkable job at adapting to new tech while remaining conservative at heart.<p>People hate their banks mostly for the costs and for the lack of human interest, rarely if ever because of the lack of technology.

1568155,comment,1566027,1566027,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"I know so little about relational databases that I'm worried about being misled by an unreliable guide found on the internet. Reading suspiciously, this guide seems garbled.<p>Section 3, second and third normal forms, says ""Under second and third normal forms, a non-key field must provide a fact about the key, us the whole key, and nothing but the key. In addition, the record must satisfy first normal form.""<p>There seems to be a stray word ""us"". Ignoring that, this is cute word play that doesn't quite make sense. If your table has non-key fields you are inevitably providing facts about the non-key fields.<p>Continuing,<p>""We deal now only with ""single-valued"" facts. The fact could be a one-to-many relationship, such as the department of an employee, or a one-to-one relationship, such as the spouse of an employee.""<p>This is the wrong way round. Usually there are lots of employees and a few deparments. Each employee works for just one department, but each department has many employees. Thus  the ""department of an employee"" is a many-to-one relation, or function, which takes an employee and yields a department. The one-to-many relationship here is the employee list of a department.<p>The example for 3.2 seems to be opening the wrong can of worms. Suppose that Mr Strauss, who works for the department of waltz in Vienna, is seconded to the department of piety in Rome, in order to teach them some dance steps. Then we want his row in the database to read<p>(Straus, Waltz, Rome)<p>So one can of worms is sticking generic labels on your fields. If you label your fields (Employee, Department, Employee-location) there is no problem. If you label your fields (Employee, Department, Department-location) you have a problem, but it is obvious. If you label your fields (Employee, Department, Location) you are heading for trouble as some users of the database fill in the location of department and other users of the database fill in the location of the employee.<p>Hmm, second and third normal form are suspiciously similar, differing only because we regard some fields as belonging to the key.

Now, cut that in quarters, because two different guests streaming data to the disk make sequential random.   so you have 25MB/s.   double it, as they are probably raid-10ing the disk (at least, that's what I do)  so we have a best case 50MB/s to share.<p>Now, they are probably in a box with 32GiB ram.   say they give a gig to the dom0, and you are on a 512MiB guest.  that means you are sharing with 62 total guests.

It's actually strongly recommended to do so.<p>Unlike what this article says, it works just fine:
- if you throw from the constructor-initializer, it destructs all the members and the base classes that were already initialized,
- if you throw from the constructor body, it destructs all local variables in scope then all members and base classes.<p>As for not being able to call virtual functions from base classes, there are good reasons why it is not allowed.<p>About bounds checking, GCC does provide a debug mode with operator[] doing bounds checking.<p>Local static initialization is thread-safe (see the C++0x standard)<p>Exception-safety is a serious issue, but solving this problem -- which is fairly easy, just use RAII -- actually leads to better and safer code.",1280766743

Using loops and cursors in MS SQL Server is enormously less efficient than the same solution done in sets (Oracle has a slightly narrower gap, but still a gap.

What have you done?",,"We're currently in the process of interviewing candidates for three open positions in our software development group.  This process typically takes us several months on average.  We see several dozen people during the process of weeding through a large pool of candidates.  Our goal is simply to hire the best candidate for the job - and perhaps we take that too seriously.<p>Two questions I always pose to candidates are ""What's your story?""  and ""What have you done?"".  I'm always interested in hearing about the paths that people take during their careers.  Sadly, most people are unprepared for such direct inquires.  Nine times out of ten people refer to their most recent experiences.  Are their careers so boring that they can't remember what they did five years ago?  I don't think so.  At least not in all cases.  The issue may be that few people think of their careers as an unfolding story.  They're unable to weave together the events that lead them to this point in time.<p>When asked, ""Have you worked with such-n-such technology?"", candidates often answer: ""Oh, I didn't have an opportunity to use that in my last job"".  What?  Who waits for opportunities to appear at their door steps?  Apparently many people do.  The successful ones are those who spend some of their spare time exploring new technologies and ideas.  Consequently, they're typically the types of people who have interesting stories to tell.  One of my favorite and well worn t-shirts reads: ""Carpe Noctem - Seize the Night"".<p>One employer I once met had a saying, ""We try to hire people with the right DNA"".  I've come to understand what he meant and perhaps I've been guilty of doing the same.  It's been my experience that software development is a tough business.  Many people aren't suited for work in the field - even many of the seemly talented developers we've all met.<p>Sooner or later you'll meet someone who is interested in more than what's on your resume.  Perhaps this has already happened?<p>Here's my advice:<p>* If you don't have a genuine interest or some degree of passion for what you do then you may be wasting your most valuable asset.  Consider a career that will make you happy.
* Reflect on the experiences you've had in your career.  How have the twists and turns helped to refine your views and interests?  What sorts of patterns are visible?
* Document your story.  A blog is a great way to do this.

1568007,comment,1567412,1567872,0,0,Xurinos,,,"As a regular vim user who explored the emacs world for a while, I have somewhat mixed advice.<p>emacs is worth learning.  It highlights certain features, almost all of which you can pretty much get in vim -- it is just a different focus.  One feature you do NOT have in vim is the ability to smoothly run a subprocess within the editor.  That is why vimmers like to call emacs an OS; however, despite the ridicule, there really is something different about the SLIME experience that you ought to feel.  There has been a lot of work on emacs to make it integrate in neat graphical ways.<p>However, if you are fairly competent in vim, emacs is not worth using regularly for editing anything that has to do with text.  The biggest issue is that to make emacs usable, you have to remap just about everything.  It is almost as if its designers did everything in their power to stop people from editing text.  For example (and there are many), vim folks make their lives quickly easier by using (book)marks and macros; compare the key combos for these in vim to the ones in emacs, and you will see one reason why emacs editing is, by default, slower.<p>I avoid remapping keys because I actually work with other people sometimes within their environment, and it helps if the keys do the same thing.  This makes for an unfortunate need for me to NOT get used to dvorak. :(<p>There are other nitpicks, such as the inability to edit/view large files (before some naysayer shows up again to ask what large files we might edit: genome files and log files come to mind).<p>Also, if you are told to try viper mode (and then told subsequently to use vimpulse.el with it -- definitely do this if you are using viper), these are good suggestions to get a fraction of vim's functionality along with some minor but annoying differences.  Again, I point you towards macros.  But also note that as soon as, for any reason, you open another buffer (for help, for an error, for giggles), you are in emacs keys world again and not in viper, so you will not be able to do your beloved Ctrl-W Ctrl-W immediately.  If you are going to try emacs, just use the emacs bindings and forget about viper/vimpulse.<p>One advantage suggested by emacs folks is the configurability of the editor with elisp.  It is true that it is very configurable.  You will find, however, that some of the difference is marketing and FUD; vimscript is a rather powerful little language worth learning in its own right.  Most people do not realize that vimscript has OOP.  And elisp does not teach you Lisp that you can use outside emacs... just Lispy concepts.<p>All that said, I am not such a hardcore vimmer that I have a ""set -i vi"" configuration in bash.  Learning emacs helped me learn how to do edits faster on the commandline.  With dual experience in these editors, I sometimes use the wrong keys (try to move forward a word with Alt-F).  Fortunately, in vim, undo is just a ""u"" away.<p>Try it out.  Let me know if you come away with the same experience or find ways to make it reasonably tolerable.",1280765522

The cost analysis revealed a low end Dell with a decent CPU, loaded with RAM + dedicated ""home"" hosting was the most reasonable option, compared to VPS or rewriting the app.<p>I paid 80 Eur/month for 100 Mbps symmetrical - add that power and lost rent costs (it was in a dedicated room of my appartment) for like ~ 150 Eur/month total.<p>The big advantage was a full control - I could do what the hell I needed with my hardware. It doesn't take too much time to do administration as you reported.<p>The only drawback was the Orange Livebox - a brain dead box sold to home users (100 Mbs/20 Mbs for 50 Eur/month) that had far too munch problems for any real use.<p>Seeing the downtime in the first couple of months was approaching 10 minutes a day, I did hook the optic fiber adapter RJ45 directly to the server. With some reverse engineering, running ppoe on a specific VLAN worked like a charm until this june, when I decided to pull the plug.<p>The project didn't catch up, it was very innovative in 2006, it is only moderately innovative now - time to kill it (parts of it will be used for a non profit help for Haiti)<p>Current hardware costs make it more logical to rent instead of build/host/maintain at home.",1280765163
