1645247,comment,1644295,1644295,0,0,RockyMcNuts,,,"The events described in the Big Short are a national disgrace.<p>Wall Street was engaged in a fraudulent conspiracy in which the buyer, the seller, the guaranty company, and the rating agency would willingly suspend disbelief so the buyer could get a 'AAA' security that miraculously paid a few hundred basis points over AAA corporates and count as AAA toward risk-based capital regulations, everyone got fees, and those 'lucky' subprime borrowers could suddenly access unlimited amounts of credit without adequate income or collateral.<p>Then when this created a giant bubble (along with other factors like deregulation, lax application of the regulatory powers that existed, a shockingly long period of lax monetary policy, and human greed) and it all blew up with catastrophic consequences, the banks got a giant bailout, went back to business as usual, and (so far) fended off meaningful reform. They said, who could have known, when the book shows many people did in fact clearly analyze the situation and foresee catastrophe.<p>That being said - there are countries that have highly state-controlled finance sectors. A notable feature is that they don't have vibrant startup and VC sectors. The only reason capital is available in large sums to start up companies like Google and Facebook is because of the possibility of rich IPO exits. Interestingly, some of those countries with regulated and state-owned banks, where the startup scene is nonexistent and the same 50 companies have dominated the economy forever, did not escape reckless behavior and large losses in the banking sector.<p>This is still America, last I checked, and people should be free to take big risks and come up with innovative financial structures. But consumer regulation must prevent toxic consumer products like the certain subprime products that were misleadingly marketed. Banks, which are systemically important, enjoy special privileges that make them a lot of money, and receive implicit and explicit government guarantees, cannot become giant extremely leveraged hedge funds.<p>So, you need to make a distinction between a highly regulated utility financial sector; and a speculative sector which can keep taking the risks and innovating in ways that create value, without the rest of us being on the hook to bail them out when things don't work out.",1283137121

In other words are Europeans just afraid of looking bad, poor or stingy in front of others in a restaurant and Americans just don't care?<p>What if portion size wasn't a problem?

Yes, I know publishers provide services for authors, but it seemed as if the author repeated the same points over and over and completely glossed over the counter-arguments.  He mentions the greater freedom that self-publishing allows, but then completely dismisses it and doesn't mention it again.<p>For a persuasive piece, I thought it was weak.

1645232,comment,1644032,1644311,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I disagree with everything you say on multiple points.<p>Firstly, Mathematicians don't peak at an early age this is just one of the many nonsense Hardy spouted. And I say this as a non mathematician < 25 who just enjoys the history of science - I have no horses in that race.<p>There are many examples of people who not only contributed work at a late age > 30 (some near or over 40) but did so while being outside of the academic community - George Green, Faraday (physics) and Grassman. Then there are those such as Weirstrass who started late or those who produced an amazing work later, some in addition to earlier success e.g. Poisson, Bayes, Fourier or Hamilton whose quaternions came quite late. And then there were the Eulers who were just none stop greatness.<p>Nextly, although maths is a subject where some topics require very little background knowledge the vast majority of these low hanging fruit (knowledge wise) are gone.  It was much easier to sketch out the core of an algebra while still in jail and have it be new and profound 200 years ago than it is today. As the amount of knowledge increases I expect the mean age of precocious contributions to increase. Knowledge and even experience will increasingly become a hard minimum.<p>Finally, you imply that only young people want to build things and have enthusiasm. I think an eagerness to learn and build great works is something you never lose. At least I hope so, otherwise growing old sounds like a very miserable prospect to me. And while the examples of old fellows not keeping up abound, I think this is simply a philosophical state that can be consciously guarded against.",1283136488

There is set of good template systems, awesome ORM - sqlalchemy + good standard lib and a pypi for all modules you can ever want. I'm a bit surprised that python is not mentioned often here as a solution to many problems (web)applications face in general - it's wonderfully all purpose.<p>Is it just because people are more used to ruby/php or python folks don't do good enough job in advertising their solutions?",1283134799

It's not exactly clear what the differences in color perception are, but it seems like the drugs that increase men's serotonin levels leave them with aesthetic color preferences that more closely resemble those of women. So it stands to reason that men's color perception is becoming more close to that of women.

The consequence of this is that Microsoft can break everything, including their promises, anytime they want by bumping the version number and removing the license for the new version. Would it be a good business decision for them? Probably not. But I think this move from Oracle shows that it is a very real possibility, if Microsoft decides they should be taking cues from Oracle (which given Oracle's track record makes a lot of sense, even if this move seems bonkers.)",1283133995
