It's a bit underpowered, but with some work loading things it can run standard OS X apps.  QuickTime can handle the same codecs used on OS X.\nWith the current model,  the more powerful but more costly Mac Mini is an alternative.<p>As described, the new model has a much less powerful and Mac-binary incompatible CPU, but it will use MUCH less energy and can handle h.264 playback with hardware decoding.  That'll pretty much rule out adding codecs for those XViD .AVI videos many have laying around.  Lack of an Intel CPU lowers cost significantly.  It seems it could run app store stuff except for the input device hmmm....  maybe it should have a touch screen?  Add video out somehow to an iPod touch?<p>Apple so far has stayed clear of directly supporting off-air or cable-tv PVR functionality.  The USB tuners from Elgato Systems work well (""Eye-TV""), but with a Core 2 Duo it would take a dedicated hardware compressor to shrink archives down to h.264 etc at a decent quality level and in a reasonable amount of time.<p>Locked down like an iPad/iPod touch/iPhone, much of the geek appeal would be gone.  The thought of a browser without ad-blocking alone is a big deal to some.\n(perhaps someone can fine a clear way to do some ad-blocking in a router with open-source firmware?)<p>Hopefully whatever Apple does will allow access to plenty of tv content that isn't costly.  DRM issues (and poor support of video that people already have) could be a negative.<p>It'll probably have (DRMed) HDMI output but no VGA or DVI.

Gmail, Maps and Android exception to that point, but Google is woefully incompetent in most other respects.

For me, where TeX earns its keep is the macro capability.  While primitive as a programming language, the ability to define your own commands is a powerful tool for enforcing consistency and reducing effort.<p>Two examples from work.  For a proposal, we had to produce two documents, a short and a long one, with common titles and introductory paragraphs and cross-references and such.  With LaTeX, we actually wrote just one proposal, with the contents embedded in TeX macros.  Changing the macro definitions let us produce what became two ""views"" of the same material.<p>Second, for a paper on sorption modeling, we used macros for all the physical variables, to make sure all the equations ""read"" correctly (e.g., writing ""\cSorbBulk"" rather than, say, ""C_b"").  Halfway through the paper, we decided on a new notation for distinguishing between gas- and sorbed-phase concentrations.  It took maybe five minutes to update the pertinent definitions and re-set the paper.",1281583309

You can vouch for them as a known quantity.<p>Ideally, a bigger proportion of hiring would happen like this.

You should want to hire based solely on merit -- but if you have to fill a job opening and your choice comes down to filling it with a total stranger whose resume claims he has 20 years of experience in ""J2EE/JBOSS/Jscript"" versus filling it with a guy you know firsthand had delivered a major threading-related fix to a previous employer's Java codebase the wiser and more meritocratic choice is probably to go with the second guy.
