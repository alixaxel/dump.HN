Definitely stay away from the sugary junk.<p>The real advantage to oatmeal is that the fiber is quite high - this has many advantages, a big one being that you'll feel full and satisfied for the first part of the day. Also, 300 calories of oatmeal is 56 grams of carbohydrates, but only 1 gram of sugar [1]. Correct me if I'm mistaken, but I think oatmeal is pretty much all glucose-based carbs and fiber, which is the healthier form of carbohydrate.

Everyone worldwide who is among the millions living on coral atolls today is facing ""rising oceans"" and salivating over possible global warming payouts from carbon tax funds. But their atolls are sinking regardless of whether carbon dioxide levels are creating warming. In fact, higher carbon dioxide levels being absorbed into the oceans (which is happening) create accelerated coral growth and offset some of the sinking effects. You might as well say that more carbon dioxide is needed as it can save these atolls. But in reality nothing can save them, all atolls sink.

Horrible RSI persisting for years, with non of the conventional treatments effective beyond a short amount of time.<p>After doing a _lot_ of research into this, I experienced an almost complete short-term recovery. It wasn't just lack of pain... muscles that felt perpetually taut and ropey were suddenly softened, and I became extraordinarily thirsty for a couple of days as healing started again.<p>Unfortunately, I only have speculation about what's going on here medically. As a seasoned skeptic, Dr. Sarno's explanation of psychological causes is unsatisfying to me. My hypothesis is that RSI is caused by a problem in the autonomic nervous system (i.e. the part that regulates your body). Sympathetic nervous system activity is provoked when your body is in ""danger"" mode: muscles are tensed, ready to act, etc. Now, what happens in RSI is that your muscles are being stressed through use (typing). This isn't normally a problem: when you stop typing, your muscles heal the tiny amount of damage that was inflicted. But if you are stressed out, then your sympathetic nervous system activity is heightened and your muscles don't get a chance to heal.<p>Now this is the insidious bit: the pain and injury eventually becomes a danger signal to your body. The injury thus provokes further sympathetic nerve activity. This negative feedback loop can thus perpetuate without the person feeling actively stressed any more, but is obviously exacerbated by feelings of worry about the RSI. Every time you try to be careful, you make the problem worse.<p>For a more medical take, some pieces are conveyed in this article: <a href=""http://www.aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_34_2_pain.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aapb.org/tl_files/AAPB/files/biof_34_2_pain.pdf</a> . Some people speculate that similar issues underlie more serious problems, like RSDS and fibromyalgia<p>So that's all well and good, but what about the ""cure""? Well, it seems that many people have virtually instantly solved their problems by adopting positive beliefs about the nature of the problem, that it is a problem caused by problematic nervous system signals and NOT an insoluble muscular injury. How does that work, exactly? I have no idea. Obviously, some stress is reduced, but that can't explain the magnitude and suddenness of the change. If anyone has ideas, I'd be very interested in hearing them.<p>If you suffer from RSI, the advice I would have is to think about this explanation while researching the ideas thoroughly to see if you're convinced. In the meantime, the best thing to do is daily exercise that isn't too intense, but gets your blood flowing for 20-30 minutes. Biking, running, yoga all have good benefits. You can do things like lift weights as well, but it is easy to overdo it, so I don't recommend it if your symptoms are severe. It's worth reading Dr. Sarno's book, but keep in mind that he uses words like ""freudian unconscious rage"", which made it hard to take anything he said seriously. In my mind, he is inaccurately explaining something which isn't true but corresponds to _some_ true phenomenon.<p>I've wanted to write this up for a while, but while I'm relatively convinced that I have a better explanation for RSI than most doctors, I don't really understand how ""the solution"" works (nor for how many people it does). I also realize that it sounds exceptionally hokey, which fuels my reticence. We'll see how it goes over here... ask me anything.",1281339705

Any $25k your lawyer may invest in the deal will be a drop in the bucked compared to another, much more influential bias: a VC can do a lot more for a lawyer's business and reputation than a typical founder. Entrepreneurs may found multiple companies and have big networks, but VCs go through lawyer-hours like fast food fries.

He didn't say anything, but what he did astounded us: He raised each of his arms and used his palms to press hard against both sides of his head, straining to squeeze his skull!  It seemed like his was trying to show us what it was like to be squeezed from the birth canal.<p>Fast Forward about twenty years.  Last night my two-year-old was afraid so my wife and I let her sleep in our bed with us.  After I woke up this morning I heard her quietly wispering to herself, over and over: ""siss-SAW siss-SAW, siss-SAW sissSAW"".<p>I listened for a long time, thinking she was probably 'talking' in her sleep, and finally quietly asked what she was saying, in case she wasn't asleep.<p>She wasn't.  She looked over at me and smiled. ""Siss-SAW.""<p>""Sister?""<p>""Siss-SAW.""<p>We went back-and-forth like that a couple times.  I realised I didn't understand what she was saying, which is not uncommon, though her speech is getting clearer - she's almost three.  I decided to try a different angle, ""Where did you hear that?<p>""Outside,"" she said first, and then she said, ""when I was a baby in mommy's heart."" I asked her if she meant she'd heard that sound before she was born, when she was living inside mommy's tummy (inaccurate, I know).  She said yes.<p>It hit me.  That siss-SAW sound was like the swishy sound a beating heart makes.  You hear it coming out of the speakers of a heart monitor.  We usually think ""thump thump"", but that is more a description of how a heartbeat feels than how it sounds.
