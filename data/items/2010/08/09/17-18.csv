At most you'll have 10-15 buyers before you realize that you are onto something and would stop your test. So the chance of someone bitching at you for ""taking"" their credit card number is slim.<p>So there is no fraud, no identity theft...the only unethical thing you are doing...is making someone read a description of a product that's not available for sale.<p>And in return you get your REAL numbers...not the inflated ones that can send you chasing the wrong idea.

1588678,comment,1588148,1588148,0,0,eitally,,,"""Efforts to duplicate silicon valley tend to fail because they attempt to follow the valley by looking at where it is now.  They don't look at the century of history.""<p>The problem is that the solution isn't to endeavor to duplicate Silicon Valley.  The solution is to start small, foster communication and collaboration between existing entrepreneurs, encourage and support a research-based creative education from the youngest ages, and to cross-pollinate interested parties with each other.  Essentially, to take the lessons learned from SV's history and start cultivating them at the micro level.<p>There are a plethora of options, but in every case the various problem solvers are not self-organized to the extent that is required to make real progress.  Consider PG with YC (or any of the other tech incubators).  They specialize in matching entrepreneurs with each other and with VCs.  That's great.  Now consider companies like 3M, IBM, and HP, that all have significant R&D branches.  Woohoo, but they're often isolated from the broader community due to IP-loss risks.  What about research universities, business schools, or NPO research institutes?  They certainly provide value and do great work, but there is often a barrier locking out the business world (except in a few cases, where researchers and professors (and their schools) actively look for entrepreneurs to support in founding either spin-offs or private companies).  Finally, what about the -- for lack of a better term -- open source community?  The problem here is that ""community"" is too loose and lack of coordination is the norm.  Even in projects that have a charismatic leader who does an excellent job stimulating communication, projects themselves tend toward isolationism.<p>As the author notes, it won't be possible to create another hub innovating at ludicrous speed without looking at the problem organically and starting small.",1281375426

Most oligopolies which successfully raise prices tend to be in uncompetitive markets, e.g. cell or cable service, and the price increases may be caused by the hindered competition rather than the oligopoly itself.<p>Consider the case of an oligopoly in the DRAM market: when they tried to raise the price of DRAM (2001-2002), they succeeded for a short time. They also collectively lost 3.3% of market share over those 2 years and members of the oligopoly (Hynix was the first, I think) quickly broke ranks in pursuit of increased profits.<p><a href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Dec_17/ai_95511290/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2002_Dec_17/a...</a>",1281374530

Walk instead. So too you can afford to not have your own house for a month but live at a friends house. Besides, the vast majority would not want to be provided a free house if they can afford it finely.<p>But with health there is a matter of principle also. The same principle that each life is precious applies to it. A person should not be free to die because of money in such a rich and prosperous country. Also, there should not be a two tire system whereby the rich can afford first class health care and the poor just enough to get on with plenty of annoyances or worse die.",1281374226

Your financials are different than mine but I hope that the below can allow you to relate so as to choose the best strategy for you.<p>My approach is a bit more traditional. I take each salary as the static factor (i.e. I will not get a raise in the future). This way if I get more money later on that would be a good surprise, otherwise I have my plan set.<p>The key factor for you at the moment is to get out of debt - all debt. I sat down and wrote my income. Then from that I subtracted the necessary expenses i.e. rent, utilities, transportation etc. I also subtracted a relatively small amount for food allowing a bare minimum of eating out and socializing. I cut all unecessary expenses and then paid the bare minimum on all of my loans and whatever was left was the money that I could spend on anything. Let's assume for a moment that this amount was $500.<p>I then opened a savings account and put that $500 there. I did the same thing for the next 3 months until I ended up with $1500. That money served as the immediate emergency fund. The number is arbitrary and I have since increased it to $2000. Your interpretation will depend on your own situation.<p>Say you had a problem with the car, unexpected expenses etc. - that is the fund that would help you get out of a very unpleasant situation later on. So if you needed say $200 for a car repair you could get it from there but you would replenish that amount as soon as you can. The emergency fund would need to have $1500 at all times. This gives you also a sense of accomplishment and security.<p>Once I had that done, I started attacking all the credit cards and loans. I started with the first one, the one that had the lowest amount. Once I paid that off, I went to the next one, the next one etc. Once everything was gone, I made sure that whatever I would spend I would be able to pay it off the next month. This way I would never pay any APR and would use my money for myself.<p>The next step would be to set up a 401K. A Roth IRA would be a nice place to start and you can choose a conservative strategy to minimize your risk. After this is set up, you will need to start setting a long term emergency fund. This would help you in the chance you lose your job and have nothing. Some people set aside 3-6 months of pay to help with any layoff. If this is set up, you will be able to pay your bills for 3-6 months and have a bit of time to find another job.<p>My point is that you cannot rely on the future since you do not know what will happen. Work with what you have today and you will be better off in the future.<p>I hope the above helps.",1281374075

""I want to see a movie"", but you don't have to specify when, where, or even which movie. Different from a traditional event invitation system, it's designed to handle more uncertainty. Because first, you want to find out if there's interest in a suggestion. If there is, you work out the details to make a suggestion actually happen.<p>It's like reddit for events. It aggregates interest among your friends, to see what everyone would want to do, without anyone having to call up everyone.<p>I'd personally use it for long tail ideas like ""going to the flea market"", which I am not sure if ANYONE might be interested. I'd just toss it out there, and see if it sticks.<p>It's a way to discover your friends.

That's the total that both the employee and employer pay together.  Sure, they could do more without having to pay that, but they also wouldn't have, I don't know... roads, police, fire department, public education, an army to protect them, etc.  What percent do they think they should be paying?
