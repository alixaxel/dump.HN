1647922,comment,1646215,1647144,0,0,discipline,,,"OK, I really need a reality check here.  First, let me make it clear - on every reddit discussion about math and about Khan Academy that's I've been involved in, I heartily recommend it.  I think what he's doing makes him one of the education heroes of the 21st century, and I'm a public school math teacher!  But...""eloquent speaker""??? Khan drives me UP THE GODDAM WALL with his palsy-mousing and repetition while he's thinking on-the-fly.  I mean, what amazes me about him is he's able to just sit down and do these videos without any script beforehand, which you can tell because he just starts making up examples while he's explaining things!!!  But as a teacher - and professional speaker - and former theatre major - he makes me crazy.  EVERY video I've seen goes like this:<p>""OK, we're going to cover (insert topic here). Now suppose we want to solve 2X=5, that's, uh, 2x, uh twoooo, (wiggles stylus, then writes 2), uh X (wiggles stylus, then writes X, eeeeequals, (wiggles stylus, then writes the equals sign), equals (wiggles stylus, writes 5)  five..."" Ad nauseum.<p>I have heard literally NO ONE mention this in any discussion about Khan Academy.  Why?  I haven't hallucinated this behavior - it's on EVERY video, because, well, it's his STYLE.  And I've never seen this behavior at a blackboard by any instructor, no matter how crummy they were (and, whoo, have I seen some crummy ones!).<p>Please, someone tell me that I've fallen into some universe where I've become the character Monk, and I'm the only one who's bothered by Khan's presentation!",1283212792

Occasionally when the stars align I can even copy text from a window without bringing it (and all other windows belonging to that application?) forward.<p>But my real question is why I should have to distinguish a small 'window' from a large 'dialog'?  Shouldn't Cmd-W work in both?<p>And why should I have to distinguish between a foreground and a background app?  Especially in the multi-monitor situation she has set up, it seems like it would be more 'polished' to have all the apps act the same.<p>This is ignoring the non-standard applications, and the absurdity that clicking on one window often brings many of them to the foreground.

Markets, if allowed to operate, will reprice correctly, and pretty quickly, things that are mis-priced.<p>Thus we can have a huge change in the market price of some particular asset due to new information--- and here's the point-- but we then have a new price.<p>Politicians think that achieving this new price, eg, the price drop, is the calamity.   But it is actually the aversion of the calamity because it brings clarity to all the players and they can start dealing with the new price.<p>The alternative, to ""prevent the crisis"" involves regulation which inherently makes prices more opaque and makes it harder for the operators to know what things are really worth.<p>I am not presuming perfectly efficient markets, they can over react, but it is the ability for prices to move freely based on new information that is the mechanism by which things get worked out.<p>Seizing control over the market inevitably does more damage, because it prevents transparency about real prices.<p>It also creates moral hazard because it incentivizes bad activity-- you just have to be ""too big to fail"" and then your actions have no consequences, or perceived consequences.<p>The mental image I think people have is that the economy is an engine and it can sieze up if there's not enough liduidity like oil, in it.<p>But that's not really right.  If allowed, it will react fairly quickly and seek the least painful solution to the problem by letting actors price based on how efficiently they can solve the problem.<p>It is important for institutions that act poorly to fail, so that the following institutions can learn from their mistakes, or institute controls to reign in their excesses.<p>It is all the external solutions, like TARP and Stimulus, that are the sand in the oil, so to speak.<p>I've broadened my response, more to make my core point, and realize you may not be disagreeing with me.<p>BTW, the FDIC increases bank failures by having a government monopoly on deposit insurance. The rates are not priced actuarially and thus bad banks are not incentivized to be good banks less likely to fail.  This is an example of the moral hazard.
