It doesn't tell the story they're writing, and it doesn't give enough information to really work out what's going on.<p>Looking at that chart, I do not see an increase in direct services traffic, such as the facebook apps they mention in the articles.  I see an increase in Video traffic, specifically, eating up the other services.  This is not the same thing.  We need more information, anyway: is this video direct streaming?  Is it video accessed over web sites like youtube?  If the latter is the case, does it really count as a separate category?  Why put services and types of content on the same graph, anyway?<p>It also doesn't tell the whole story.  I'd like to see a similar chart of total data transfer.  Obviously the total amount of Internet data transfer has skyrocketed over the same period, and we already know the way the proportions work out... But for all we know, web usage is growing in absolute terms.  Maybe it's not growing as fast as video-specific web traffic, but it's still growing.  Besides, technology to effectively store and transmit video in place in websites is relatively new.  It should be no surprise that it's piece of the Internet pie is still growing!<p>Overall; kind of bullshit.  I like the idea that non-http services are taking over the Internet, but the numbers Wired presents don't validate that one way or the other.",1283169468

You may think you explained, but to me, without your obviously extensive knowledge and experience, you didn't.<p>You say:<p><pre><code>  > I did mention a specific part of both frameworks,\n</code></pre>\nThat wasn't clear to me at all.<p>If you had said something like:<p><pre><code>  > I disagree - consider component/feature X.  It seems\n  > to me that Django is *way* ahead in that regard, and\n  > for some applications that's far more important.\n</code></pre>\n... then you'd've got an instant up-vote for me.

For comparison: single home PC does about 2.5 million word counts per minute using local files and mergesort instead of network.<p>This is why I asked - 300 words per minute using using 6.5 million randomly available nodes vs 2.5 million words per minute using one home node - that looks like a huge waste.

Some went to college, but for something completely unrelated to programming (me).<p>Would I be a <i>better</i> programmer if I had studied it in school? Almost certainly. But I tried taking a CS class, and it was so dry, so inapplicable, and so poorly taught (or, granted, I might not have been the best student), that I walked away from it thinking that programming was nothing I wanted to be associated with, ever. Instead, I got into front-end development. In time, I realized that to execute on the ideas that I had, I'd need to learn web programming — something my school didn't teach. SO, over time, I taught myself.<p>To sum up: If his friend is excited about getting started programming, I wouldn't steer her towards getting a CS degree any more than I'd steer someone interested in music towards getting a music degree, someone interested in running to a kinesiology degree, or someone interested in writing to getting an English degree.
