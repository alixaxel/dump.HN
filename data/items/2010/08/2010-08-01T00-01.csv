Physical resources are going to be tougher to acquire and more expensive and major scientific advances are going to be more difficult. It won't surprise me at all if the cheap, easy growth of the 19th-20th centuries turns out to be the exception, not the norm. I expect a lot of the current hype and froth around social networking and the web is going to turn out to be no more monetizable than it was ten years ago when people were making similar handwaving arguments about revenue and profitability.<p>I suppose Asia might buck the trend but a portfolio highly skewed in that direction now is a fairly speculative investment.",1280624287

1564520,comment,1564168,1564491,0,0,nocman,,,"While I'll be the first to admit that many (perhaps most?) developers (present company included) have a tendency to quickly conclude that other people's code sucks (at least they do at some point in their careers), I have to disagree with the idea that there is <i>no</i> such thing as code that genuinely sucks.<p>I've read a lot of code in my lifetime, and some of it genuinely sucks.  There <i>is</i> a such thing as a bad developer.  There are people doing programming who really have no talent for it, or for some other reason are just <i>really</i> bad at it.  Sometimes it is due to lack of experience.  Sometimes it is due to the person not caring at all.  And I am sure there are plenty of other reasons.  It doesn't mean that a person can't get better, often they can get <i>much</i> better, but people <i>do</i> write code that sucks.<p>Understand, I think I am now <i>much</i> slower to be harsh toward other people's code than I used to be.  In fact, I regularly give people the benefit of the doubt.  Why?  Because I've worked for that megalomaniac that wants done yesterday what can't possibly be done in a month's time.  You know, the one that thinks that because his work consumes his entire life, and causes him to neglect his family and other responsibilities, so should yours.  I've worked in multiple high-pressure situations, where no one cares what the code looks like, as long as it is done tomorrow.  And you know what?  Sometimes in situations like that people slap together whatever they can (as fast as they can) with duct tape and chewing gum, whatever it takes to get that unreasonable person (or people) off of their back.  The results are often ugly, and you can argue whether the person could have done it better in the same (or even less) time.  But I think it is worth cutting the other guy some slack.  Thankfully, I no longer work for the megalomaniac (and haven't for many years) :-D<p>However, getting back to my original point, there is code that sucks.  It may not be as prevalent as some think that it is, but believe me, it is out there (even after giving the other guy the benefit of the doubt).<p>Geez, what's up with me and the parenthetical kick today (perhaps I've been writing too much Scheme code recently).  :-)  <- got one last one in there.",1280624113

Although I'd love to be able to organize tabs better, I don't care about that nearly as much as I care about the performance of my system when that many tabs are open.  (a)  Memory usage (b) risk of some plugin or javascript on a page causing firefox to start eating 99% of my cpu.<p>Theoretically those two problems can be solved concurrently, but still-- favicons, hotkeys, and the ability to drag and drop solves most of my problems with tab organization.  I use alternate windows only when really necessary.<p>What I'd really like is to have a second, isolated firefox process that I can run alongside my main one with as much functional independence as possible.  One process will be for the relatively safe, familiar, and stable, text-oriented type sites with minimal advertising (hacker news, gmail, wikipedia, python.org, clojure.org, paulgraham.com, etc.), and the other process will be for heavy sites, new/risky sites, or otherwise problematic sites (eg if I have a youtube tab open I can't ctrl-PgDwn past it, when I hit that tab I have to stop and use the mouse-- a pain in the ass).<p>While Chrome's process-per-tab model is really nice, they're still all tied together and there's a risk of losing everything sometimes.",1280623431

For example, allow them to submit a comment, then say ""this comment will be submitted when you sign up"".

I shared a few on my blog (<a href=""http://reddit.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.blogspot.com</a>) during the startup, but we lucked into Chris because he went back to his PHD after doing YC that first summer and had 2 spare bedrooms, which Steve & I promptly moved into when summer ended and PG talked us out of moving back to Virginia.<p>Chris generally just made us feel guilty for ever needing to sleep (since he was helping us part-time and PHD-ing at Harvard the rest of the time -- oh, and he met & dated his future wife then, too!)",1280621452
