Would your family have forced you into #1, or would you have been subsidized for #2?<p>The situation didn't come up, so it's hard to say.  I studied something with practical and relatively lucrative applications (CS) rather than stuff like classics (actually, now that I mention it a good undergrad friend of mine had a full ride scholarship because of her family's financial situation, and she majored in classics).  If it had come up, well, I'm sure there's a point at which making an extra $1-2k on the summer wouldn't be worth the experiential opportunity cost, but I primarily worked to make money, and would have balked at an internship that didn't even pay my living expenses.

(30 year treasuries are paying 3.65% now.) Sure it's easy to point out during the worst financial crisis of the last 70+ years that the S&P has fared poorly over the last decade. However even now, in a time of relative disaster, over the last 50 years (the timeline we're looking at if we're retiring at 30 and dieing at 80) it's returned about 8.5%. (That's using this chart <a href=""http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/charts/chartdl.aspx?symbol=%24INX&CP=0&PT=11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor/charts/chartdl.aspx?sym...</a> and a little math). Average since the Great Depression is more like 10%. While many people now believe it will be lower going forward even the worst skeptics are talkinng more like 7-8%. I don't know that I buy it because, as the old joke goes, economists have predicted 9 out of the last 5 recessions, but even if so that's a vastly different picture than 4%, and excludes the fact that there are many investments with higher ROIs to be found readily if you're either willing to do more work or accept more risk.<p>That's not to mention, FU money doesn't have to mean a jet-setting lifestyle. It just means enough to do what you want. One could live very happily in most of America spending $100k/yr, including their home. That's actually quite a bit when you consider that you're not paying income taxes, just capital gains. It's like making $150k, or 3x the national average.

Passion is the content, and technique and skill is the delivery vector.<p>As for breaking the ""rules"", the theory goes you have to master the rules to break them. Expressed in a more technical way, once you know the rules, you know when and were it's ok to break them, and you can also adhere to most of the rules while only breaking one or two.",1282615824

Making predictions of the next 40 years based on the last 40 is likely to lead you astray. A whole <i>bunch</i> of things are coming to a head. Coming revolutions in biotech alone are likely to seriously shake things up, IMO.",1282615818

Probably most of the researchers of submitted articles which the reviewers criticize or reject use the same equipment.<p>The price of the equipment is not a factor in the credibility of the work. It does not make it more or less credible or flawed in any way. It is unusual to see the price of the lab equipment mentioned - that's all.",1282615734

It seems much more difficult to use them as a way to make money from a normal site, although I've had modest success with relevant Amazon links (Amazon is nice because you get commission if someone clicks through and buys <i>anything</i> within 24 hours, not necessarily the product you linked).",1282615680

I'd recommend hiring someone with more modern sensibilities/tastes to redesign the front page. There are little things: the first signup button isn't centered, the bottom one is way too small and laid out wrong.<p>3) ""Wait, does Facebook do that?"" Answer this question, clearly.<p>4) Show your product. I should be able to see it, get a taste of it without signing up for it (this matters more in the beginning/without network effects which is where you're at).<p>5) What are your USPs? What is Facebook not doing? The major two problems are context collapse, which you're addressing, and privacy. Think about addressing that as well.
