There's really not a 'hate' issue here, and people will use the coins, but it's so painfully obvious that there won't be a change until the bill is phased out. It amazes me that the coin was even allowed into production without a plan to get rid of the bill - I can't believe that the hope was to have ""a greater variety of currency media for circulation"", which seems to be the only real effect of the coins' introduction so far.",1281441535

It's the same old industry that wants to charge you those transaction fees (that's at least kind of reasonable, you know?..) on top of $185972398742134 in monthly fees for everything from renting equipment to account fees and minimum charges and what have you. I think I went this way because it was cheaper than an Authorize.net+whatever mess (for brick and mortar, mind you) and better than the fees others wanted, on top of my spotting the brochure while shopping at Costco.<p>> ...update from the real world.<p>All things considered, I don't think there's anything fundamentally different about physical purchases vs. online purchases made with a credit card. The only big one is that micropayment systems and fees aren't really in place for brick and mortar retailers that might struggle just to accept cards in the first place, whereas it's becoming more and more common online because people are buying 99 cent songs and apps all over the place. It needs to happen for the former because people make 99 cent purchases everyday anyway (usually combined with something else, or else they're paying with cash...hopefully), but that's a problem that hasn't even been sufficiently solved in an all-digital world that loves the idea but can't easily do it because of all the damn fees.",1281441357

1591150,comment,1590755,1591086,0,0,silencio,,,"That ultimately depends on the merchant agreement. Regardless, it's a percentage and/or a flat fee (and usually the flat fee that makes no sense for micropayments), and varies depending on other factors (which creditor, what kind of card, etc). But that's not what I'm talking about. Typically in the US the merchant is responsible for paying all fees and is not allowed to explicitly charge the customer for it in any extra way except through methods like ""cash discounts"". So the customer will pay for this some other way (like raising the price of the product). I guess that's the difference I'm nitpicking about here...just as ridiculous as it is ok to provide cash discounts but not credit card surcharges, it's ridiculous to claim you're not paying anything for those additional fees, because retailers that have to deal with the possibility of micropayments aren't exactly oblivious to the fact that a percentage+flat fee just killed their profit on a $2 purchase.<p>There is a lot more to the cost of accepting credit cards than just the transaction fee, just as there are costs of accepting cash.

But I still think <i>certain</i> things must be learned in childhood to have a chance at reaching your maximum potential.  For example, as far as I understand, unless you learn a language as a child you will never be able to get to native speaker level no matter how long you are immersed in the language (though you can probably get so good that only a native speaker would notice your mistakes).<p>I also think saying ""if you work hard enough"" is a bit of an oversimplification.  Technically I believe that's true, but practically people first have to realize that they actually can learn X.  For example, if someone was always taught X poorly they may assume they are incapable of learning it and, therefor, wont ever put in the work required (assuming the effort would be wasted).<p>I do think every non-mentally handicapped person has the same potential as a child [1], which is why investing heavily in teaching (and teaching of teaching!) is so critical.  An average teacher can teach average people pretty well, but an outstanding teacher can teach <i>anyone</i>.  I think a lot of people today assume those that ""don't get it"" are just genetically of lesser intelligence.  In my experience their brains are just wired differently and because of that it takes a different strategy to get them to have the ""aha!"" moment.<p>I think the reason many people believe that some people are just genetically stupid is they look at e.g. what's happening politically in the US, how some of these people can't be reasoned with, make life changing decisions based on pure emotion, etc., etc. and just assume ""well, they're simply too stupid to be capable of anything else"".  I think these people simply haven't learned how to <i>learn</i> nor how to reason.  It may well be too late to reach them <i>now</i> but I think there was a time that each and every one of them <i>could</i> have been.  And that's important to know when planning the future.<p>[1] Same potential as in: everything child A can learn/do adds up to the same value as everything child B can learn/do even if child A and B both excel at very different things.

Just like CC processing fees can be a huge pain in the butt for microtransactions, but taking cash and lots of it to the bank is a mindfuck and you decide to call one of those armored courier services instead.<p>That being said, speaking from personal experience owning and running retail stores, credit cards are a pain to accept because of the transaction fee vs. microtransaction issue when people decide to pull their credit cards out for all of a $2 purchase, but more customers spend more money usually because they didn't have any cash on them.

1591126,comment,1589345,1590102,0,0,fmora,,,"This my response to all the people that have disagreed with me and have asked me for proof. There have been studies like ""The Bell Curve"" book were they attempt to demonstrate how intelligence varies among people. You can read more about the book here:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve</a><p>Basically it supports the view of many people here that there are great variations of intelligence among people. An article that counteracts this type of belief to some degree is this one:<p><a href=""http://minority-health.pitt.edu/archive/00000515/01/Intelligence,_Race,_and_Genetics.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://minority-health.pitt.edu/archive/00000515/01/Intellig...</a><p>I'm not trying to make this a talk about race but unfortunately these are the closest things I could find that talk about human intelligence overall.<p>As a young person I used to believe that some students in my class were really indeed smarter than most of us. They always seemed to get good grades. I used to think that you were either smart or not and that there was nothing you could do about it. As a young mind thinking like this was very destructive. Who knows how I got out of it but I finally discovered in high school that just by studying regularly I could achieve good grades even if I were not smart. That I could get as good grades as the smartest kids in class and that sometimes I was ""the smart kid"". Though I knew that it was only because of the hard work I put in. I've seen a lot of friends doing really bad at school and that once they started putting some real work their grades started to improve. The only time that I've seen work made no difference was with kids that had mental disabilities.<p>Eventually by reading the biographies of several successful people like Buffet, Edison, Einstein, Newton, Trump, Galileo and books like ""All The Money In The World"" by Peter W. Bernstein And Annalyn Swan I came to the conclusion that what really makes the difference is hard work. All of the successful people that I read about had one thing in common, they worked really hard to become successful.<p>I have to admit that I'm still highly surprised that people would disagree with me on this one. I'm still in shock. I know I'm going to get down voted for this but I'm highly suspicious that a lot of people like to believe that some people are smarter than others to make themselves feel special. Honestly I think is complete B.S. and I'm calling you guys out on this one. You guys are all full of B.S. Most human beings posses the same level of intelligence.<p>Thinking that only some people are smart enough to do certain things is like poison. I certainly do not want to be around people that think like that since if you do they will poison you too. And yes, I won't let let door hit me on the way out.",1281438846

In Italy Berlusconi even went as far as asking his industry friends to stop advertising in the newspapers who wrote stories against the government in an attempt to shut opposition.<p>So there's ample evidence that the strong dependence on advertisement has damaged free speech.<p>Until the Internet came along though, there was no alternative. As you point out without advertisements' revenues free newspapers would not exist. That is because printing newspapers and broadcasting tv shows is very capital intensive. But the Internet is making publishing costs very low, and hence letting everyone have a word (as shown by blogs or comment boxes such as this).",1281438093
