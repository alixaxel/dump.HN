I quote<p>""<p>I think these products are great.<p>For example, Mick Johnson, CEO of Wheroscope/Stalqer/Zotora/ChildPulse/BindTwo/Gasbag/Knetckr/… was a childless 30-something guy at the start of 2009.<p>But due to the power of location-based services, he has apparently discovered that he has not one, but multiple children, one of whom is apparently old enough to be taking soccer lessons.<p>From a ‘review’ that Mick posted to the App Store, of his own product:<p>“I think it’s great that I can give my child more freedom and at the same time get more peace of mind. I’m not worried about where he goes, but it actually makes his life easier if he doesn’t have to keep calling me to let me know he’s gotten home from school or is later to soccer practice. At the same time, it’s easier for him to know how long until I arrive when I’m driving over to pick him up.<p>I would love to be able see more than 1 of my kids on it though – looking forward to the update. “<p>Is this guy blowing smoke?

The transition will be similar to the one we saw a few years back when everyone made the shift from Myspace to Facebook.<p>Even though I am 20 and in college and am friends with everyone I know in real life, everyone I knew growing up and from summer camps, and many of my internet friends as well, I rarely go on anymore. It used to be a daily activity.<p>What went wrong? I think it just became so popular, had so many people that it wasn't not interesting anymore. We all have a little hipster in us - once everyone you know and their mother and their grandmother is using something, it starts to lose its appeal.<p>Lastly, Facebook had too much change. They could have updated it once or twice with fairly big changes and been fine. I noticed that I hated hearing about facebook or going on facebook when they were rolling out new privacy agreements and rearranging the site layout once a week.<p>There is a big potential for anyone developing the next social networking site.

1580453,comment,1580115,1580434,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""if you want time when your parents won't be tracking you, you negotiate to get that time. It's like the negotiation that happens whenever a child wants to do anything without parental, or adult supervision.""<p>The above is valid only if kids without your product have to negotiate <i>right now</i> for every moment out of sight of an adult. I don't think that is true (in general) anywhere. That would be a terrible childhood (and adolescence).\nYou are shrinking the time kids <i>do</i> have away from adult monitoring (at least as far as their location goes)  to zero (with the unswitch-off-able version).<p>Just replace kids with employees. You can ""negotiate"" with your employer to not track you when you are off work, (he'll just get a message that you've switched off). So what's the problem?  No adult will accept such a service  (and there are good reasons for it). Why don't they apply to kids (including teenagers)?<p>But the problem isn't one of negotiation. The idea of subjecting <i>anyone</i> to potential 24 hour surveillance is terrible, especially when you dangle some bling in front of kids too young to realize what exactly they are opting into. Yes other people (including governments)  are doing it but ""he's doing it too"" was never a valid defense.<p>(Imo) Kids shouldn't have to ""negotiate"" not being monitored every second of their lives. At least adults have the intellectual sophistication to think through the consequences of a  leash like this and would flee from any such product like the spouses you interviewed, iow adults, are doing. Of course they aren't interested. Adults see the potential for misuse easily).<p>Kids are more likely to be too blinded by the thought of an IPhone to fully understand what they are giving up. And frankly I think only immature kids will ever consent to this kind for trackability.<p>I don't know you guys from Adam and  I don't blame you for building this. You are trying to make money and not building anything illegal (I think). All I said is <i>I</i> think it is a slimy product (in other words  <i>ethically</i> slimy  not legally)  and would never buy it for any kids I know.<p>This might make sense for <i>very</i> young kids or old people suffering from dementia or Alzheimers or something, but these don't need to be bribed  to give away their privacy with an IPhone they couldn't otherwise afford.<p>All this needs is for one nasty incident for this to blow up in your faces. I <i>am</i> (slightly) surprised Apple allows this on their phones (and that YC is funding this. wtf?!!). As I said, not illegal, but (again imo, feel free to differ, ymmv etc) a somewhat unethical <i>product</i>.<p>To repeat, I am not condemning you as evil people. I do think you are being somewhat disingenuous with the ""kids can opt in too"" argument. Kids are not in a position of equal power with parents/other authorities for their ""opt in"" to have much value as a justification.<p>All that said this is <i>your</i> business. You (and your investors and customers) have to think this through. I am just a remote person expressing his opinion on the ethics of this thing.",1281079254

Fundamentally though, we're pretty committed to the idea of making this useful for both parents and for children, and hoping that ""last defenses"" won't be needed.<p>As an example here, we built the system intentionally such that children would know their parents' location in addition to the parents knowing the child's. That's got a few implications that are pretty important, but for starters it means that parents aren't asking their children to do something that they're not willing to do themselves -- that actually raises the bar pretty significantly, and I think it does drive home to the parents exactly what it is that they're asking of their kids.<p>Do we think that parents should know when their kids have disabled the app? Right now: yes, we do. I'm open to the idea that we might be wrong on that, but to my mind it's just an extension of the negotiations about trust and so forth that parents and kids already need to engage in: if you want time when your parents won't be tracking you, you negotiate to get that time. It's like the negotiation that happens whenever a child wants to do anything without parental, or adult supervision. To my mind privacy invasion and responsible parenting are different things, and I think the straw-man arguments presented in that direction are a little unfair to parents, though I concede that there will always be exceptions.<p>We did actually look at doing this for spouses -- not to detect cheating (a cheating spouse will be even more motivated to subvert the system than a child), but to help out with stuff like ""are you near the supermarket? Can you pick up some milk?"", but fundamentally people don't seem all that interested in it.
