Very nice man, and a great speaker.<p>His talk was about the influence the appearance of comets had on politics in classical civilizations. It was an excellent presentation.<p>As a visual aid, he brought out Roman era coins, from his personal collection, which commemorated comets and various leaders, including Cleopatra if I remember correctly. As he finished talking about each one, he would hand it down into the audience to be passed around and viewed by everyone.<p>I remember thinking that that was pretty brave of him, considering the size of the audience and the low lighting conditions. But he got them all back.<p>He will be missed.",1282435094

I think any type of game built into a system really needs to be designed carefully and with an eye to the consequences as well as the rewards. When your business is to motivate people you have to be careful not to do it too well I suppose.",1282432210

He could've outfitted his home with heat-pipe solar thermal collectors, like the Thermomax ones.  These things work well, even in the winter, even in cloudy, chilly old England, where they were designed.  I suspect they'd do a pretty bang-up job in California.  Connecting those up to the hot water heating the floors would've taken a <i>big</i> chunk out of his carbon footprint, even if he couldn't heat his home completely with them.  They're worth it just for the hot-water preheat.<p><a href=""http://www.thermomax.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thermomax.com/</a>",1282432104
1623833,comment,1623279,1623279,0,0,barrkel,,,"I would actually object to describing Clojure's multimethods as being multimethods, especially in the CLOS sense of the term. Clojure's multimethods are more like a clumsy, dynamic version of functional pattern matching, with a classification predicate applied to the arguments to select the target method. In this sense, it's the programmer - the supplier of the dispatching function - who has the job of doing the dispatching. This trickiness of this dispatching is probably the motivation behind the CLOS language feature, but Clojure foists it on the developer.<p>What would more normally be described as multimethods is the dynamic equivalent of a static language's implementation of overload resolution. Overload resolution has subtle semantics in languages that support it, and is surprisingly difficult to get right, as it has competing design forces: the flagging of ambiguity, versus inferring what the user - the customer - wants.<p>There are two steps in both overload resolution and multimethod dispatch: discovery of the set of applicable methods, and then the sorting of those methods by how specific they are to the argument types. Every parameter type in the winning method needs to be as specific, or more specific, for that argument type, than every other method's parameter type. The single most specific method, if any, is chosen. (The OO case of inheritance is just a special case of specificity.)<p>There may be no applicable methods, in which case it's a simple error. But the case of ambiguity is fraught with difficulties, because users generally prefer their code to do what they mean, and inferring that from what they say - the methods they declare - can be difficult. Suppose your language supports implicit conversions of values to supertypes, or to supported interfaces. Overload resolution forces you to specify a priority here - which method to prefer in the case where the relevant parameter type is alternately one or the other - or to produce an error - i.e. telling the customer that they're wrong. Bring other language features, like user-defined conversions, variant types, untyped parameters, multiple inheritance, etc., and you can can quickly find yourself in a mess.",1282432092

The person your responding to is correct to point out out money supply is being inflated, and inflation has been increasing in rate.<p>This may well lead to economic troubles which will cause some businesses to lower prices out of desperation.<p>You can call that price deflation if you want.<p>But don't forget the qualifier and then claim the other guy is wrong when you equate one economic phenomena with another by misunderstanding the terms.<p>I know you probably haven't heard about this, most mainstream economics talk is acutallu political talk that tries to pretend inflation is measured in price (an effect of, not the cause of inflate.)<p>For instance it is correct to say inflation was one of the causes of the great depression which resulted in price deflation.  Also a major effect there was the real deflation of the criminalization of gold that literally made the us currency illegal eliminating much if the money supply -- while inflating paper money.",1282432001

Very precise, I know.<p>Second, here's wikipedia take on the Millenium problem: Somewhat surprisingly, given their wide range of practical uses, mathematicians have not yet proven that in three dimensions solutions always exist (existence), or that if they do exist, then they do not contain any singularity (smoothness). These are called the Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness problems. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US$1,000,000 prize for a solution or a counter-example.<p>Does the article directly relate to the Millenium Prize problems? I can't conclude anything but it seems like just a small part of the whole. It think people are excited because there was a lot of talk about the possible solution to the P equals or not NP problem.<p>Maths at those levels are esoteric to most people and as such, presenting papers like that is pretty useless in mainstream media. If one could find a good analysis of the conclusions and possibilities, it might be a lot more useful.",1282431653
