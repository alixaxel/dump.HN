1582805,comment,1582402,1582779,0,0,lsc,,,"eh, the social drama is different, and it depends on the industry.  For instance, I can hold down a SysAdmin job just fine, as a contractor or not, but I lack the social skills to rent out people who work for me as sysadmins, even when they are obviously good people and I'm charging below market rates.  in some cases, I've given up and suggested the people for direct hire... and they got hired, at rates higher than I would have charged, even including my cut.<p>I think either way, there is a tradeoff.  If you get shit done, people will put up with a lot of social problems, in both situations.   Like the guy who wrote a hn story about how I didn't answer his support email.   He refused a refund and wanted to remain a customer... the thing was, he wanted better support, but when the rubber hit the road and it was time to cut a cheque, he chose cheap over good support.<p>You can set up your company so that social skills don't matter as much, but that limits what markets you can go after.   You can also choose your career while working for others, and get similar tolerance for social oddity.<p>(of course, the OP's problem was not so much social skills as flexibility, and being self-employed almost always is more flexible than working for other people.)",1281142459

The music is just sourced from YouTube, so anyone can do that. The ability to play music is a convenience feature.<p>My main goal with Like.fm is to have a music app where you can publish what you've listened to that isn't targeted at music enthusiasts (2 out of almost 300 facebook friends have a last.fm app installed). You can follow people and merge top tracks. It's extremely passive (no need to change music listening behavior) so it's easy to get started.

1582785,comment,1582402,1582771,0,0,Mz,,,"Not when you have something really deadly, like cystic fibrosis.  Most people with CF are on several thousand dollars a month worth of ""maintenance drugs"" -- ie when they ""aren't sick"" -- and take more when they have an exacerbation.  They account for something like half of all pediatric lung transplants and a third of all adult lung transplants (edit:  Those are probably US specific figures).  Meanwhile, I am dismissed as crazy for saying that diet and lifestyle can make a really big difference.<p>The current state of the art advice for CF patients regarding diet is ""high calorie, high fat, high salt"".  The medical establishment routinely pushes unhealthy foods at people with this condition because such foods have a high fat count and, therefore, a high calorie count.  Healing my body has shrunk my appetite.  I no longer need the extremely high calorie diet that is the norm for my condition.  I get treated by the CF community like I made up my diagnosis and was never actually sick.  The idea that you can have CF and get well is wholly alien and utterly rejected by most members of the CF community, as well as the medical establishment.  Most research for treatment is for drug therapies, not diet and lifestyle.  The idea is that since it is so deadly, the treatments need to be equally scary (much like chemo for cancer patients).  I have found that is completely wrong and is, in fact, part of the problem.",1281141738

I have a form of cystic fibrosis, which has a life expectancy in the mid-thirties.  My 23 year old son has the same diagnosis.  He has not been on antibiotics in over 12 years and has taken no medication for about 3 1/2 years.  This was achieved by carefully arranging our lives, something you cannot do in a job. He also has other issues, like eyesight issues. I currently work for a large company and have been stuck in the same entry level job for nearly four years.  Conditions at work are a problem for me due to my health and this means my performance at work is not that great and it shows.  If my son has adequate control over his working conditions, he can be very productive. If he doesn't, he can't be.  Most employers are not going to accommodate his needs.

1582763,comment,1579298,1579821,0,0,flatulent1,,,"""Well-managed firms""?  Some would debate whether that term describes MS very well.  The notion of directing resources towards what's profitable isn't new.  The lesson should be to have smaller brilliant teams with clearly focused targets.  If they're just entering a market and can't measure profit, it would seem strange to underinvest. They might have to invest for a while. As the Xbox has shown, it can take a while to become well established and profitable.  Given that they're up against very strong players in phones and they're doing very poorly in that market, it seems like your book would suggest ditching them and focusing on something they're good at.  It seems like they'd also have a hard time doing anything revolutionary (totally new GUI and apps) with tablets, but maybe a hacked version of Windows is so much cheaper to do they might as well even if its third-rate (maybe 4th, behind Apple, Android, WebOS/HP).<p>As for customers, some would argue that businesses cut back more than consumers in a tight economy.  There tends to be little expansion, few new startups, and most stick with hardware that's already working.
But consumers still have children going to school, and some have machines that become unworkable for them (less skill in avoiding and coping with malware than businesses have).  In spite of naysayers predicting that consumers would stay away from premium products during the major downturn, Apple certainly has had healthy growth by any measure, and did well with its' OS upgrade sales as well as hardware.  It seems buyers are out there if one has what they want.
If Microsoft did focus excessively on corporate IT, it was through lack of insight.  They've certainly had the financial and human resources to throw at any market they were after.  reliability and profits took quite a while for the Xbox, but it does enjoy a significant loyal base now, probably more than for most of MS' other offerings where there's more lock-in than love.  Some feel they've overstated Xbox profitability some by lumping it in with the Mac business (which includes Mac Office revenue).<p>The Zune doesn't seem to have either a huge following or contribute in a very important way to the overall profitability.  In terms of an installed base that'll continue to stick with the company, the Xbox seems far more successful.<p>I find it hard to accept that any underachievement in timely delivering of innovative well-received products is the fault of lack of resources.  If anything there seem to be too many people not working together with good focus.  They've obviously got some very talented engineers and have shown some cool things from R&D.  The failure to produce more fruit falls on management.<p>I think they're finally getting the idea that desktop Windows is not the answer for a phone, but they don't seem to have a clue for tablets.  If they did we would be hearing from all sorts of developers about NEW apps.
Trying to push desktop Windows as the solution is a bit too much like eating yogurt with a pitchfork.
They may not yet be ready for a fresh start on the desktop, but they'd be foolish not to start anew on tablets.<p>Patch Tuesday coming up brings 14 patches addressing 34 vulnerabilities.  (with the recent hacker convention, it's the season for finding bugs in every platform, even Apples')<p>If Microsoft has had anything that could be considered a disruption for development, it's the constant need to put out fires the vulnerabilities bring.  I think it's fair to say that their past emphasis on upgrade sales through feature bloat while neglecting less visible security, performance, and stability, is/was a management failing that has cost them heavily.  Besides taking resources, it's also made alternative platforms much more appealing by comparison.<p>""Consumers only buy Windows with new PCs""
That seems to be true for the most part but why?  Maybe if updates came out more often, most people would at least have hardware that would be suitable.
Apple makes gets significant sales of OS upgrades, proving it is possible.  Keeping more of the installed base up to date widens the base for app developers to cater to, and would help weed out legacy browsers.",1281141079

And before I started I had extremely limited exposure to Last.fm.<p>I tried their Mac client once and it was a horrible experience (it was a windowed app whereas Like.fm is a menulet in OS X).<p>I remember it being an additional layer on top of how you normally listen to music (hearting songs). Like.fm uses existing user interface to generate your top tracks (rate songs directly from iTunes + frequency of play).<p>But most importantly, none of my friends, or anyone I knew, uses Last.fm (and I believe 2 out of 300 of my facebook friends have the Like.fm app installed). So I figured there's space to make a way for non-music-enthusiasts to share music info with each other. That's why Like.fm is really passive. You just play songs from iTunes like you normally do, rate them like you normally do (if you do). Then on Like.fm I guess what your current top tracks are, and share your play history with other people.<p>Also Like.fm doesn't require you to play hundreds of songs to build up a robust profile. The top played list on your profile is meant to represent your <i>recent</i> top tracks. So you just have to play some of your current top songs and it <i>should</i> be accurate. Recommendations will be based on who <i>you</i> choose to follow, so it's not directly dependent on training the system with your playback data.
