Much reduced footprint, power cost, admin cost (at small scale your per server cost is going to be higher than the large scale guys). Plus someone else will have done the integration and tuning work.<p>I think even on a small scale, or perhaps that should be especially on a small scale, people could profitably look at the mysql/nosql/memcached (the latter optionally with persistence via flash) from some of the appliance vendors.<p>I have no financial interest or direct experience, but the data sheet on this:<p><a href=""http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/datasheets/Schooner_DS_Memcached.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/datasheets/Schooner_DS_Memca...</a><p>looks worthy of a closer read.",1282619602

The entirety of the night in regards to hacker news however has been quite revealing.<p>This place is no less a waste of time than telly. Your insistence simply proves so. Anyone who has been in a university just knows that they had access to the journals they needed, but perhaps not some they might have wanted to.<p>Yet regardless, neither helps us in our endeavour. Whether the person publishes all the journal articles, I care little. This is no longer a community. No longer are etiquettes and the culture of the site enforced, it is a play ground instead where populism wins.<p>That is fine, that is how things have been working. You go there first and leave when so it becomes. Yet I thought naively perhaps that this time it would be different.<p>It is not. Only in the physical world is it different, only in the physical world do we have the freedom, for in that sphere, nature has had the advantage of many years.<p>Not even the best and brightest can come even close to it. Though maybe I am just naive to suggest that PG is either of those in regards to the internet. He is of a different generation, of a different age too, in his 40s or 50s, chasing money or whatever he chases.<p>This is our net to make.

1628803,comment,1628356,1628356,0,0,stuntprogrammer,,,"For a fleet of ""scale-down"" servers to be practical the first problem is that the admin cost per server must be very low. With, ohhh guesstimate 70,000+ servers, Facebook presumably has that metric under control.<p>Next, certain types of workloads don't make sense. Anything CPU-bound or poorly scalable (eg. traditional database workloads). Again FB should have plenty of work that scales out relatively effortlessly (note the relatively) and
have moderate memory and bandwidth requirements per process. Though in the aggregate you'd expect very large usage of both!<p>For suitable workloads, working back of the envelope, ARM will hopefully lead to some highly competitive, if not new record, scores on metrics like requests/joule or requests/$. Enery consumption and server cost being important at that scale..<p>Now for the in-memory caching or database workloads, which want either more memory or faster CPUs, Flash can be used to address capacity at the cost of a couple of orders of magnitude extra latency - albeit a couple less than hitting disk. Back of the envelope, anything that looks too much like a traditional database workload I'd leave on grunty x86 machines. Ditto for any CPU-bound.<p>So, lets speculate on how to build a machine based on ARM for the types of workloads we care about. Lets assume we don't design a new core but work with a vendor on a
System-on-Chip using ARM hard macros. This is very back of the envelope and we'd need to break out spreadsheets to get this nailed down right.. but lets have some fun..<p>Our hypothetical SoC would be<p>. Cache-coherent quad-core Cortex A-9 @ 2GHz
. PCIe interface on chip
. 1Gb ethernet interface on chip
. SATA ports on chip
. Memory controller<p>connected to 4GB ECC memory per server. I'll get back to storage.<p>Now, this should be small and quite low power server. Within a 1U sled we should be able to pack say 6 or perhaps 8 of these, along with dual power supplies (for the entire sled of machines). If possible I'd have distributed power redundancy by including a battery in the sled rather than hooking up to external UPS.<p>I'd use an internal 1Gb switch which itself is connected to the top of rack switch. We get local cheap communication between the servers, plus we make cabling significantly easier and keep the cost of the top-of-rack switch down. A more whacky alternative would be to use short-range 
radio. Fewer wires, potentially more bandwidth, but something I'd like to hammer on in the lab before going anywhere near the datacenter.<p>Now, for the pesky 4GB per server memory limit and storage. We have a few interesting options. We can add flash per server, or, given the $/GB perhaps one machine in the sled gets it and acts as a local memcached server with the ability to fall back to accessing remote ones. We could also have a local file server with, for example, 1TB of storage via 2 flash-augmented disks (eg. seagate momentus xt disks). With good staging of data, we could even make this sled a good building block for throughput-oriented data-intensive
work (eg. mapreduce type work). We have lower IO bandwidth but we've also kept the CPU performance down to levels where we have a fighting chance of feeding them.<p>Obviously, you need your software to run there. Chalk one up for relatively easily ported open source code without being dependent on a slow-moving vendor.<p>The above is rampant speculation and there are many interesting design points - it's great to see someone trying new things and taking advantage of changing hardware ratios to profit.",1282619321

Perhaps it'll find use treating hypersensitive premature ejaculators with a robo-fetish, but I sincerely doubt this is a step closer to the sex-bots that have been predicted forever.<p>Someone seriously needs to seek out female companionship, even if it's just an old playboy stuffed under the corner of their mattress, if they found that in anyway sexual.",1282618891
