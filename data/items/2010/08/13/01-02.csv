1599751,comment,1599266,1599348,0,0,theBobMcCormick,,,"Of even greater concern to me than the loss of the tactile experience that books give to readers is that, to my knowledge, there's nothing equivalent to the public library system for e-readers.  Libraries are important for any youth, but particularly for poor and disadvantaged youth.  They're a <i>huge</i> democratizing force, providing mountains of information and education for free to even the poorest members of society.  Thanks to the prevalence of DRM on ebooks, I think the odds are against us seeing anything as universal and far reaching for ebooks.<p>Ebooks are great for the privileged middle and upper class.  But thanks to DRM they lack the lend-ability and share-ability of real books, and they require a relatively expensive ebook reader.  Even if libraries have the ability to lend every ebook ever published, it'll still require kids using the library to have a relatively expensive and fragile e-book reader. With real books, all they have to bring is an inquisitive mind.<p>With real books, even poor and disadvantaged children have access to books, not just through libraries, but also through borrowing, and sharing books from friends, relatives, neighbors, etc.  And because most books are cheap to the point of damn near disposable in our society, most kids can count on getting gifts of books, hand-me-down used books, etc.  Heck, it's pretty easy to scrape up an enough for a paperback on an allowance, lawn jobs, etc.<p>This worries me a lot.  While I know that the circumstances I grew up in are very privileged compared to most of the world, we were poor by US standards.  My family was often on some form of public assistance, and there's no way in hell I could have afforded a Kindle, Nook, etc. if such a thing had existed in those days.  Growing up, the local public library was my teacher, my escape, my best friend.  I'm saddens me to think kids in the near future may not have access to that same wonderful resource.",1281663376

With branches you can have n parallel branches, whereas with Wikipedia it seems--though I may be wrong--that you just have one version history, with one or more revisions within that history flagged as ""approved"". (Having n branches of a Wikipedia article would be frowned upon, since the community decided in the early days that you can't fork an article--that only gets in the way of building an authoritative and neutral version--though it has been argued in the past that having multiple forks on controversial topics, each written from a particular point of view, would be more informative.)<p>Also, Git-style branches only make sense as alternative branches of the <i>entire repository</i>, which doesn't exist in Wikipedia terms because you can't atomically commit changes to multiple articles together. It's more than possible to have a wiki with branching and cross-page atomic commits--it's even a good idea. But it wouldn't fit Wikipedia. And to get around the atomic commit problem (given the massively concurrent editing that happens on Wikipedia) you'd have to essentially have one Git repository per article, at which point you're probably better off with a different type of backend.",1281661796

I then saw non technical friends starting to talk about the iPod. I honestly felt it was like hearing non technical people discussing recursion. I knew the iPod must be different. Sure I had plenty of friends that new what MP3's were and downloaded them, but they were my technological friends.

As Jon Ive says in the quote above:\n""It was about being very focused and not trying to do too much with the device -- which would have been its complication and, therefore, its demise."" I had already realized this works very well for In-N-Out Burger. So well that when Chipotle came out I knew it would be a success.<p>It has really surprised me how Steve Jobs laid out the winning model for making a product 9 years ago and few companies have followed. It is actually rather frustrating.

It sucks.""<p>[1] The ARCHOS had a bunch of features such as a camera, camcorder and it could play videos. But I never used the thing. The interface sucked and the battery life sucked.
