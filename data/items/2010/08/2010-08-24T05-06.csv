1629114,comment,1629081,1629081,0,0,carbocation,,,"Nothing that has been discussed on HN lately will, likely, lead to an HIV cure. HIV is notoriously difficult to eradicate due to the fact that it stays dormant inside of immune cells for years. This is why the only cures that you hear about are those that have been induced via bone marrow transplant (which were done for other reasons, not for HIV; BMT is highly dangerous and the risk/benefit is strongly against doing this for cure of HIV alone).<p>I don't think that your statement about homosexuals is the most useful statement one could make about the HIV epidemic in the United States. There are various groups that suffer more from HIV than others: homosexuals, yes, but also ethnic minorities (blacks have 7x the incidence that whites have). This may just be semantics, but in my opinion HIV isn't really ""mostly tied to homosexuals."" It is true that a majority of new cases of HIV (57%) are due to male-to-male sexual contact, but that still leaves a vast 43% of the pie for heterosexual contact and IVDU.  <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/factsheets/incidence.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/surveillance/resources/factshe...</a>",1282629451

1629107,comment,1629024,1629073,0,0,buro9,,,"Cool. If you want any pointers let me know. I've basically built this twice before for medium and large enterprises. Unfortunately the company I worked for didn't appreciate fully the general applicability of the product (they thought it only solved project management problems, only 1 of our customers fully understood it solved nearly all of their ""first 80%"" reporting needs), but it did allow data to be fetched from multiple backends (Excel, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, etc) and to be fed into one database that added snapshots over time (configurable granularity from 1 day up to anything).<p>To companies that had trouble getting their data together the sale was always easy as they appreciated the problem. But most didn't appreciate that problem so it's hard to sell on that basis.<p>The real value and the whizz-bang that sold it to most companies was how I presented the charts. I used SharePoint to create chart blocks, and these could be connected to other charts via a very simple connection framework.<p>Example: Drag one chart onto the page, configure it to look at some data. Drag another chart onto the page and configure it to look at some other data. Drag a filter onto the page and connect Chart A to Chart B via the filter and specify that Chart B's data is restricted to the selected series in Chart A.<p>What you then get is a multi-level drill-down and sets of building blocks that allow you to build any dashboard you want and to have pages that show really rich related charts.<p>Unfortunately the company I worked for only ever considered this as a project management solution even though it worked for all structured data from any source.<p>My latest toy (in my spare time) is how to do the same thing for semi-structured data and data that may be structured but not consistently. This is just because what I saw as constraints to reporting within larger companies wasn't the lack of data, but the lack of common edges that could power reporting.<p>Anyhow, I'll open source my work on SharePoint in a month or so, feel free to use whatever you need. It shows how to fetch data from multiple SharePoint systems in an eventual consistent way. And it also allows for storing data from multiple tables in the same few tables whatever the structure whilst being extremely efficient at aggregated reporting queries.",1282629016

It either requires a lot of smart code rolling up large amounts of data into manageable pieces, or a very big piece of iron that can deal with somewhat raw data. And in either case, everyone has their data in a different format in a different database on a different OS. The result is that you need a behemoth piece of enterprise software or a custom written solution.<p>Even if you build a really smart UI that lets you quickly build reports that slice and dice you data, one dimension is too large to quickly process, or the ID's in another set don't quite line up. Something. There is always a problem that comes up that makes those canned demo videos look comical.<p>The best tool I've used where I felt it was both easy to use and powerful is Tableau. But, the price tag ended up being a little too high to swallow.<p>Note that one space I see that is under served is outward facing dashboards. If you're an advertising company and you want to show the results of the campaign you ran for a client, you have to send them an excel file or write your own custom dashboard. A server that manages authentication, data versioning, chart presentation, regular email updates, browser compatability, etc. is adding a lot of value. GoodData is working on this problem, and I think they are on to something. The concept has a viral quality, as well, as every client they sign up exposes their technology to all that client's clients.",1282628808

I was already using Evernote for much of my idea-keeping but this inspired me to organize it better.  The initial idea is but one piece of the puzzle.  As you brainstorm (no matter where) you need to record the ideas and then take action.  Too many ideas die not because they were bad but because a plan of action failed to take root.<p>My routine:
1) write down the idea and all related points in Evernote and that goes in backburner tagged appropriately.
2) Mindmap the idea out.
3) Start wireframing<p>- note this is just fleshing the idea out.  All the while be searching for competitors and testing out what they have done. Take note of likes, dislikes, and not implemented differences with you.<p>4) Check google trends and keyword generator to see how many people have been searching for your solution.  Do not be discouraged if you don't find a lot here... sometimes things really are novel (like, what keywords would one search for if looking up a twitter like service?).
5) Start talking to everyone about your idea.  Hit up tech meet-ups and anyone who would be your potential client regarding the idea.  People will be really nice and say nothing but good things.  Do not let this idea ego-stroking go to your head (think about it... when have you ever asked another entrepreneur the hard question ""why?"" when you're really thinking the idea is without merit?).  Ask everyone you share the idea with ""How would you improve upon this?"" or ""Is there anything out there that you've seen like this?""  or ""Is there anything about this that you think is off?"".  When asked people will volunteer their honest opinion (or complete misunderstanding of the concept).  Again, don't take any of this wrong... you may just be lead in a whole new direction or be given some great ideas to add to it that you never considered.
6) Take it all in and break it down to its absolute core.  Then take that core and break it down again.  Take all the esoteric meaning you've given it out and break it right down to the true MVP. Then get coding.",1282627704

For example, once she invaded the space of the other and provoked him, while he was growling she just stood there observing <i>my</i> reaction to the situation. After I stepped in and defended her only then did she trust me enough to stay around me. Another time she started playing the doggie equivalent of hide and seek with me. She would watch me approach from underneath cars and then run off to conceal herself, while keeping track of my movements.<p>This is something really incredible.<p>I don't think that anyone has ever expected a dog to develop and <i>test</i> a complex theory of mind. Her behavior is just too complex to explain otherwise, and herein lies a very interesting problem. How do we know that she actually has one? How can we tell if she is as smart as I assume? To decompose the problem a bit, how do you judge what constitutes intelligence in the narrow framework of a dog's existence?<p>This is perhaps one of the most interesting problems I have come across in a long time. Even though it's doubtful that I'll discover something Earth shattering, but I want to at least make an attempt at solving it and perhaps we will learn something really fascinating about the mind along the way.<p>So, how would you go about it? What experiments would you perform? How would you set about in creating a doggie IQ test?<p>The best part is that I am in the position to execute the experiments as long as it doesn't hurt them (see: http://imgur.com/7O1xA.jpg )<p>Thanks in advance.",1282627468

I don't know whether you need to host with them to use them to register domains, but ... here's what I love about them: DreamHost makes it really really easy to move your domains away from DreamHost. That sounds counter-intuitive (if they're so good, why would I want to move them away?), but it isn't. When you set up an account with GoDaddy (or other registration services), if you later decide that you want to change your registrar, they have a CRAZY process that you have to go through where you have to get an e-mailed code, that you then have to enter back into a random form at GoDaddy's site, and then you have to do something else, and only THEN do you get the authorization codes to actually move your registration. At DreamHost, those auth codes are one click away. And that's the kind of thing they do: They make it easy to work with them. And if you ever decide you need to move on, they make it easy to stop working with them.<p>So, yeah. I don't get any kickback or referral for referencing them.

1629031,comment,1626403,1627140,0,0,wbeaty,,,"Google on ""Fundamental diagram"" of traffic, or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_diagram_of_traffic_flow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_diagram_of_traffic_...</a> It's a set of graphs. Density plotted against speed, etc. It's old stuff, empirically derived. As flowing cars slowly get closer together on average, drivers slow down a bit for safety, yet with more cars passing per second, so the flow increases. But then as they approach even closer, drivers must greatly slow down because of reaction time issues, even though more cars are packed onto the roads ...and so the slowing dominates the extra cars per mile, and average flow decreases. The peak flow ends up being 30MPH - 40MPH. That flow will most rapidly drain out the backups. I hear that it's a different value in different countries.<p>But worse is the problem that once everyone slows past the 35MPH hump, traffic becomes unstable, and you get oscillations or standing waves which slow things far more than you might expect.<p>Rule of thumb (but I've never seen it stated anywhere) 35MPH=51FPS, 3 seconds between cars, gives 150 FEET BETWEEN CARS. Closing up gaps will wreck the max. flow pattern. During congestion, if you start trying to stop others from ""cutting you off"" or merging ahead, then you're the one causing the jam. (Or to be fair, 30MPH and 2sec gives 90ft spacing, perhaps the bare min.)<p>Another issue: in 1998 Helbing and Huberman discovered the existence of distinct 'phases' in simulated multi-lane traffic. When all lanes seem to lock together like a moving crystal, that's now called ""Synchronous Flow,"" and gives maximum throughput.  But it's on the edge of collapse, and ""condensations"" are triggered by anyone who tries outrunning neighbors by switching lanes, or who approaches too close and has to tap the brakes.  <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v396/n6713/abs/396738a0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v396/n6713/abs/396738a0...</a>",1282626066
