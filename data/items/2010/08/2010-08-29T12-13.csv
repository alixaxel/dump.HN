(I had that option.)<p>The other approach is to place the boot structures in a boot partition; to use one of the four slots available in MBR for a partition for the boot tools.<p>The consoles I was working with support EFI (and which has its areas of brain damage) and console makes allocating a GRUB2 boot partition trivial.  That keeps the console and its tools from stomping on the partitions, and the applications from stomping the boot loader.<p>If you're stuck back in BIOS-land with MBR (and no easy way to launch into EFI), there's likely no good solution to these collisions other than grabbing an MBR slot, as there's almost certainly no general Windows coordination policy here other than ""don't do that"".<p>Microsoft Windows itself has occasionally and classically stomped on foreign-format disks; it had the galactic stupid of writing a ""harmless"" signature to disks it didn't find MBR structures on.  If the console pilot allowed Windows to write that ""harmless"" signature and your foreign file system was corrupted.",1283086790
1643740,comment,1643180,1643544,0,0,cdavid,,,"Gender and sex are different things for once. I think many people who are against the usual ""men and women are different"" idea think that that most differences are a consequence of the culture more than genetic predisposition. Pushed to the extreme, the idea that men and women are the same is indeed ridiculous - but I think the idea that men are more often disposed to computer programming as ridiculous myself. To give some (anecdotical) evidence: I have been to open source conferences in the US, Europe and India. In both US and Europe, the proportion is mostly young men (+ older men for people in academia), as you would expect. In India, I would say a good third were women, up to 60 year old women.<p>Certainly, there is little data to back the natural difference up AFAIK, and again correlation is not causation. For example, how much is due to the fact that women willing to have a child need to have them in a period which is generally considered crucial for your job ? For law and medical related jobs, the mandatory length for studies is much longer than for tech - is this a factor ? I can think of many other reasons to explain the current situation which has nothing to do with ""how our brain are different"" and other platitudes. It may be true, but it is so close to the usual cliches that people will legitimately consider them as such unless you have strong evidence to argue it.",1283086701

I'll try to reply to a few of the points raised in the article (but I have only skimmed it, so if I missed your point feel free to point it out).<p>Darwin is still being updated. Back in 2006 Apple didn't release the x86 code straight away, but I think they did so after a while.<p>DarwinBuild still exists and (apparently from their webpage) it is still being updated. This is a project supported by Apple whose only purpose is to build Darwin<p>As for Apple not including some of the drivers code in Darwin I can't say I am surprised. By looking at the fights between kernel people and drivers developers on Linux it seems a lot of companies (e.g NVidia) simply would not accept their secret sauce to be open sourced for fear it will reveal secrets of their architecture. Though correct me if I am wrong.<p>Finally the article you linked to asks why should people contribute to Darwin if Apple is less than helpful. Here I agree with you. Apple could do much more to help and encourage Darwin. But I don't see how this would be any different if the code were GPL.<p>And incidentally Android uses the same technique (keep development closed and open source the final version once it's being used) but everybody praises Android for being open source. (which is true, since they did open source _everything_ and Apple keeps things like Aqua closed source, but my point is that you don't hear quite the complains about Android's development model, as you do for Darwin's).<p>As for your second point, I think X-instance replied better than I could.",1283085873

The numbers speak for themselves, although of course a return of more than a couple of handfuls or so of IPOs per year would change that (less than that when you just count tech firms).<p>I've heard it costs something more like $2.6 million, but it's going to be company specific and the cost might have come down as people and accounting firms got experience.  However the pure $$$ cost is only a portion of its total expense, it's also a time and attention sink and it <i>significantly</i> increases the liability (including as I recall criminal) exposure of some of the company's officers.  Plus it costs a LOT of time (a year or more), money and attention upfront to get your company SarBox compliant for an IPO, and too much of it is insane stuff that does <i>nothing</i> to improve your real business.<p>If you remember your chemistry, look at it as raising the activation energy needed for a reaction.<p>Agreed this should be ""the best of times"", but you're still talking about fairly small scale and limited domain areas.  As I keep harping on, where's the next FPGA like thing going to come from?  The only really big ""new thing"" hardware based startups I know about are Tesla and Space X and they were funded by a single angel.  Who got his money from co-founding PayPal, which was a <i>perfect</i> fit for eBay to acquire, which is a prior to SarBox public company.<p>I don't really know about Twitter (but it's <i>tiny</i> in terms of people and revenue, all out of whack with its impact), but Facebook has clearly made a decision to stay private for whatever reasons.  It could go public, investigating why they've decided not to might be worthwhile.<p>The cash on the sidelines is a good and big question.  Some say it's not so much at net, i.e. companies are keeping it to make sure they can service their debt (unfortunately debt is massively tax advantaged compared to stock based capital), others say (and this is clearly related to the first point) that it's being held in reserve for the Dark Times To Come.  Or at least fear of such.<p>There have been too damn many 2,500 page pieces of unread monster legislation passed with no end necessarily in sight (let's say that confidence in what the Republicans might <i>try</i> to accomplish when they get one or both houses of the Congress back is not exactly high) ... in times of <i>colossal</i> uncertainty keeping reserves can mean the difference between your company's survival and death.<p>E.g. will the insane file a 1099 for any corporate recipient of $600 or more per year insanity be repealed?  If you're a small business (< 500 employees, half the economy), well, you best keep some reserves in case you have to do that (it will cost a lot of money and friction, and will likely cost a lot of companies business as everyone decreases the number of companies they do business with).<p>Etc.<p>At the furthest extreme, compare to 1937 when ""capital went on strike""....",1283085841

1643715,comment,1642345,1643319,0,0,barrkel,,,"Even if you are writing a production compiler, you will likely not be using a tool, nor writing a tool, to generate the parser. Most production commercial compilers in practice use hand-written recursive descent with a hand-written lexer, which itself potentially uses feedback from the parser (very handy for parsing C or C++). Recursive descent usually gives context for error recovery that matches the way most programmers think about language syntax; and with it being written by hand, the recovery can be tweaked to be as smart as necessary.<p>Also, IDE / editor support like intellisense can greatly benefit from integration with a recursive descent parser. If you encode the cursor's position as a special token, the parser can handle that token and do a deep return (throw an exception, longjmp, whatever) with relevant context, active scopes, etc.",1283085560

1643707,comment,1642345,1643145,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"A very large part of compiler operations involve analyzing and transforming tree/graph data structures (once you've parsed to an AST), so you want a language with good native support for those structures. Pattern matching and garbage collection help immensely, as do ML's inferred static types. Working with complex data structures is really where ML shines.<p>It's not just ML, though - using a language where you can work directly with native tree structures (ML and Haskell's type constructors, Lisp sexps, Prolog functors, Lua tables, or even JSON) means that you can postpone learning syntax/parsing and <i>start</i> with the language's semantics. You can save the syntax details for when you have the language design worked out. Compiler books based on C (such as the dragon book) spend such a long time on parsing upfront because they don't have much choice.<p>Also, Andrew Appel works on SML/NJ, and the C and Java books are translated from the ML version. I've looked at the C version (which uses lex and yacc instead of ml-lex and ml-yacc, mallocs but doesn't free until later in the book, etc.), and while it's still a good compiler overview book, I'd strongly suggest getting the ML version instead. The ML version uses Standard ML (SML), but I've only used OCaml and didn't have trouble following it and making the minor adaptations along the way. (I haven't looked at the Java version.

Or when you're speaking a foreign language and your ears can suddenly hear a place where you've always been speaking with a slight accent but which you didn't know about before.<p>My point is, from the beginning, I've made many such realizations and corrections and at some point I guess I just made enough to be able to create a profitable company.<p>The flip-side is, I feel like I'm still playing my instrument badly, just slightly less badly than before. Every day I wake up anxious about sales and think about my latest expansion plans - just trying to add stones to the wall that stands between me and starvation, which is what I've been doing all along.<p>I'd be interested to hear if others have had a similar experience as I.",1283084099

You still have to press an awkward key combination to switch to ""copy mode"", the normal mechanisms (PGUP, mousewheel, scrollbar) only result in garbage.<p>I've tried various partial fixes (""altscreen off"") but none works properly across sessions or with multiple windows. Years back I even tried to patch screen myself but had to surrender over the (for me) crufty code-base.<p>And that despite the solution being fairly obvious: Just redraw the entire window while scrolling, just like irssi and plenty other console apps do it. And just like screen itself does it in copy-mode.<p>I wish someone would finally take on this issue...",1283083376
