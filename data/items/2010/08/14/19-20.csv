Perhaps it would've. But it's also questionable whether Linux would've supplanted BSD in popularity, if BSD hadn't been locked in a legal fight.<p>Whether or not these are good for everyone or bad for everyone is hard to judge. But as stated, software patents are a spur to innovation (Linux isn't necessarily better than BSD, but it is its own innovative phenomenon -- the same with the web) by being an antispur (causing stagnation) to greed-touching systems (Oracle, Google, Microsoft, etc., all have parts of their business that are motivated by capitalistic desires or what Gordon Gecko, etc., called greed).<p>I probably shouldn't have said these were the 'best' things to happen to those respective technologies. But who knows how important they are? Certainly it's easy to overlook them -- as the larger frame of reference in which technology develops is often overlooked.<p>So that was my point in responding to the last sentence in the article proper:<p><i>If you still think software patents are a spur to innovation, you're not paying attention.</i><p>But, I understand the signal/noise ratio is a big concern, so somewhat argumentative claims are usually discounted.

1603893,comment,1602975,1603219,0,0,sokoloff,,,"If your frame of reference is an economy coach ticket, if you say ""it's more expensive to fly private"", you'll almost never be wrong. (Your economy coach ticket is <i>heavily</i> subsidized by the first-class and other full-fare tickets.)<p>If your frame of reference is a first-class or full-fare business class ticket, I can often beat or near the airlines on both cost and door-to-door time. (If the keys to the plane are in your pocket, there's no getting there an hour ahead, dealing with the parking garage, the TSA theater, maybe a delay on takeoff for crew or aircraft availability or ATC/ground holds, perhaps changing planes, waiting at baggage claim, etc. Plus, I can often start and end the flight much closer to the ""doors"" I want to be at, leave my shoes on and carry 4 oz of gel deodorant in my bag if I want.)<p>As to ""that's worth it"", I bought a Cessna 182/Skylane (4 seat, single-engine, 160 mph high-wing) a little over 12 years ago, and have flown it for business travel as well as most of our in-US, east of the Mississippi, personal travel, as well as a few trips west of the Mississippi. It costs me under $2/mile on average, and the direct operating cost (aka marginal cost: the cost of an incremental trip within a year) is just under $1/mile. If I had to, I'd pay 2x what flying actually costs me without thinking about it.<p>If you want to travel in your aircraft (as opposed to just going flying), I'd suggest you take the traditional route and go all the way to the private pilot's license. Far fewer restrictions, and if you enjoy flying anyway all of the ""extra"" time is hardly wasted. IMO, there are too many restrictions on LSA/recreational pilot's certificate to make it usable to actual go places with 3 friends, etc. It's nice to be able to fly into BWI for an Orioles game, or fly up the Hudson River at night, cross Central park and Laguardi tower and head out on course over the Whitestone bridge. I think it's great that the FAA created the easier licenses, but I don't think they are practical for travelling.<p>Used airplanes are reasonably cheap now, and loans and insurance are easy to get. (Most airplanes are made of aluminum and have nearly infinite lifespans, with avionics, engine/props, interior and paint being replaceable items over the life of the plane. Think of a 30-year old airplane as much more like a 30-year old office building than a 30-year old car in terms of ""acceptable to rely on"". They're inspected annually [or ever 100 flight hours for rentals/commercial usage], and no reason a 30+ year old plane wouldn't be perfectly reasonable.)",1281815539

People use drugs because their lives suck.  People drink because their day sucked.  People use drugs to change their state of reality because they do not enjoy the state they are in.  I think the funny part of it all, in some shape or fashion, government is the reason why people do not enjoy the state they are in.  Taxes, rules, and regulations are created for every aspect of your life.  The government controls every part of life and when you are high, there is no control.  You get to be free for as long as the high lasts.<p>To the decriminalization, if I can grow it in my back yard, the government should have no right to say what I can do with it.  If I have to create it in a lab setting and plan on selling it to someone else, then there should be some control.

1603867,comment,1603562,1603562,0,0,thegeezer3,,,"Bio: Learning Japanese and now able to read programming, business and general how-to books and communicate via email using Kanji. Reading literature with its flowery vocabulary and Kanji though is still very hard. Can write under 1500 - 2000 Kanji and know nearly a pronunciation for each symbol though there are many many more and far from fluent. I've also started to do some basic translation (Japanese to English) and helping out at Japans Annual Ruby Conference this year with translation. About 5 years in.<p>From personal experience:<p>The biggest factor in how fast you improve during your studies is environment. Noticed I said during your studies. Simply being immersed isn't good enough. To create your environment you can (in order of effectiveness):<p>Find a boy/girlfriend who natively speaks the language. Its best if they cant speak yours. This is steroids for your language learning.<p>Failing that find roomates  - the more the better. Nearly as good.<p>It doesn't matter if your stuck in your home country - I've met Japanese people who rock at English just because they either had a lazy English speaking partner who couldn't be bothered to learn the lingo or likewise lazy roommates.<p>Start reading websites, magazines, listening to music and watching films or youtube all in your target language. Pursue your interests as much as possible using your new language. If you like hip-hop then listen to underground hip-hop artists via youtube. Grab their lyrics from the net and translate. Sing it out-load in the shower.<p>Skype for discussions, Lang8.com for writing blogs and peer review etc etc etc<p>If your looking at becoming very conversational (talk about wide range of subjects comfortably but not yet bling bling) then its going to be 3 years plus. With that in mind you have to be a well oiled machine with vocabulary management, just being 10% more efficient with your vocabulary means a saving of 3-4 months and compared to the traditional use of lists on paper, software such as Anki helps you be at least 20% more efficient.<p>Assuming your in this for the long haul, don't neglect the reading and writing part for languages with scripts or ""funny"" symbols. Rather prioritize it since being able to read books and magazines will help you grasp how things are said naturally. You'll meet new words everyday and come across them time and time again in context helping you internalize them faster. Unlike conversation, you control the pace when reading and its more comfortable for beginners and intermediates. I tried learning Kanji the way native Japanese people do and failed miserably. I tried some books most crap but one gem called ""Remembering the Kanji"" was absolutely amazing. In 2months I got through 2000kanji and by 6 could draw every single one from memory. And there were faster learners than me! I'm sure there's something for Arabic script if that's tricky.<p>Get the basic tools. Get a learners dictionary to start. Once you start getting better, try an Arabic dictionary for Arabic kids i.e. no English written whatsoever. Ideal would be a dictionary for the pc to aid faster lookups via copy and paste. Don't by cheap crap though as it will probably have awful explanations and  old fashioned examples ending up in you sounding like someones granddad. \nLikewise look for a good grammar reference.<p>Get a dictionary plugin for Firefox. I use rikaichan for Japanese. I simply hover over a word and the definition pops up instantly. Very handy.<p>Lastly implement all of the above slowly one by one, remember Rome wasn't built in a day and have fun.<p>Hope that helps and good luck.",1281814167

SRS can help with this. I personally like using online dictionaries and translating the example sentences. Any word you don't understand in an example sentence, look up. It will take a long time, but eventually you will start to remember common words. One day you will get to the stage where you recognise 95% of the words you see, and that's enough to get basic understanding of most material. You'll probably eventually want to aim for about 10,000 words of passive vocabulary. At 10 minutes a word, that's already 1500 hours+, about 40 weeks, 40 hours a week.<p>3) Mandarin or arabic are languages that many people speak and study. You'll be able to find plenty of material online, videos, radio, news, blogs. TV and radio are probably less efficient if you're not able to read similar material, so try to find material with transcripts or subtitles and use those.<p>4) Teachers can be helpful, but are expensive. VOIP classes may help with the cost, or living in a country that speaks the language. The main thing teachers will help with are correcting usage mistakes and pronunciation. Working with a teacher is in my opinion not much more efficient (maybe less) than self-study for pure vocab learning, so self-study vocab if you want to save money. Useful exercises are writing essays (ideally by hand) and having them corrected, and reading passages out loud for pronunciation practice. General chat can be helpful for building confidence and because it uses different vocab.<p>5) There are lots of free resources for learners online. For example, <a href=""http://www.dliflc.edu/products.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dliflc.edu/products.html</a> has an Arabic grammar search, and some other Arabic resources if you look for them. It maybe worth trying some of these. Try different language versions of topics in Wikipedia, sometimes the foreign languages are translated directly from the English versions. Or for words you can't find in a dictionary, try doing a search with the target language equivalent of ""what's the meaning of xyz"".<p>6) Unfortunately though vocab and time are the limiting factors, so though you may be slightly more efficient with software and specialist podcasts (definitely worth at least trying some free learning site podcasts for arabic, sure there must be some out there), optimise for maximum time spent rather than software bought. While my mandarin is a long way from where I want it to be, I'm reasonably fluent in the basics, and given time I'm confident I'll get there on the rest.<p>7) I've spent a fair amount on private tuition, but nothing on specialist software, and the textbooks I've bought I haven't used much. A good dictionary will do you just as well as a lot of textbooks, though textbooks won't do any harm, just not essential. So don't worry too much about not having the right tools so long as you are able to figure out example sentences in a dictionary, armed with plenty of patience you'll probably be alright. Incidentally I'd say with today's internet, it's probably less important to go overseas to study than before, although it probably won't hurt (apart from the disruption of moving to a new place). Language partners can help, but if you're aiming for 500 hours of study it's likely that you can earn enough to pay for a teacher for 500 hours in less than 500 hours doing something other than teaching English, so consider this more for fun unless you particularly enjoy teaching people.<p>8) Don't worry too much about age. Do worry about motivation and the time you spend. Kids grow up in an environment with educational TV shows, parents and teachers correcting their mistakes, and many hours of language classes learning literature, grammar, composition, public speaking, and so on. You can do some but not all of this, but as an adult you have responsibilities and so the limiting factor is likely to be the time you decide to spend on these areas. Try finding kids TV on youtube or equivalents, but realise that it's going to be more expensive and hard to simulate the learning environment of a child compared to a child growing up in the country.<p>9) You'll forget things if you don't study for a while, native or non-native speaker. But you'll pick them up soon enough when you start studying again. So don't worry too much about that, aim for regular study, but study when you can is better than not at all.<p>10) Before spending the thousands of hours and the money to learn a language, be clear about your goals and the level you want to attain. You can go anywhere up from understanding a menu and asking someone where they're from to understanding a country's culture and literature and being able to talk fluently with natives. To really get good at a language you'll need to spend a lot of time, this will be easier if you can justify it for reasons beyond just the language, probably professional or personal reasons in the long term.<p>Put the time in and you'll get there before too long. Have fun.<p>Edit: <a href=""http://gloss.dliflc.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gloss.dliflc.edu/</a> has lessons for many languages. Edit2: Karaoke can be fun too - search youtube. Edit3: I like this one: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgElZAj3ePI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgElZAj3ePI</a> quite funky, though it's difficult to know if her accent / vocab is standard, it's still fun to try to follow.",1281813670
