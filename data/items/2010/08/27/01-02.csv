Its job is to make fonts look smoother and crisper, and in majority of cases it does just that. I'll accept that OS X's rendering of bold fonts on dark backgrounds is terrible, which is where the text-shadow trick comes in handy (or antialiasing, which I think is the same thing in that case), but I'm not sure that for body fonts this is the right way to go. I see this technique popping up here and there and in many cases the fonts end up looking worse.

I'm not involved in that decision or whether it would be in desktop Firefox however.<p>An H.264 specific backend wouldn't be too hard to do.

It just so happens Apple chose almost the exact opposite when compared to Android.<p><pre><code>     - portability between hardware architectures\n</code></pre>\nAndroid went with the VM solution.  Apple chose fat binaries when going from PPC to X86.  They also use fat binaries for ARMv6 and ARMv7.<p><pre><code>     - portability between operating systems (mostly)\n</code></pre>\nApple handles this at the OS, framework, C language, and compiler (LLVM) level.  The Unix bits of OS X and iOS are essentially the same.  CoreFoundation is essentially the same across iOS and OS X.  Cocoa and Cocoa Touch share the same design ethos as well as a number of classes.<p>If you assume Unix then a VM isn't that big of an OS portability win.<p>In general, Apple doesn't believe in cross-platform Apps.  They believe in trans-platform Apps.  Every single pixel in a Mac, iPhone, or iPad App should be pixel perfect.  Java and a VM doesn't really give you any benefits with respect to this.<p><pre><code>     - memory management that doesn't suck\n</code></pre>\nObjective-C 2.0 on Mac OS X has garbage collection.  I imagine garbage collection will come to the iOS world when Apple believes that the performance tradeoffs make sense.<p>In general, memory management is hard.  Memory leaks are trivial to find for an experienced programmer with Instruments.  Leaks are tough for a novice programmer.  But hey, life is tough for a novice programmer.<p>Memory management involves more than just garbage collection.  Running out of memory is a big problem on handheld devices.

In the 20th century we got cars, planes, helicopters, rockets... and now we still have cars, planes, helicopters and rockets (do they make hovercraft anymore?). No major advance for decades. Compare to communication, which seems to change beyond recognition every ten years.<p>What then is bound to happen is that we develop some sort of theoretically inter-stellar range communication technology. Of course by the time we do that, we'll be lucky if humanity has so much as a moon base. But the chances are we are not the first intelligent race, and a number of intelligent races will already exist, and will have already have implemented this technology.<p>In effect, we will switch on one day and find a galactic internet (the Intergalacticnet?) of forever isolated planetary nodes. Once we figure out how to decode and communicate etc., we will exchange/trade information and progress will increase exponentially. But no field trips (maybe some sort of VR/avatar tour of alien worlds though).<p>IMO sci-fi writers get it wrong when they show spaceships bumping into alien civilizations etc. Regardless of whether that sort of transportation is even feasible, communication will have been established much sooner.",1282871701
