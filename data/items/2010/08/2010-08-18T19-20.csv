If not, I just wanted to point out the problems with this scenario that make me as a technical person never ever respond to this.<p>1) Programmers hate working with empty-drum ""idea guys"" and that's what it sounds like you are.  You don't have a single technical person on the team?  It sounds like that since you're offering the CTO position and say ""manage all the code and technology behind our product for 12 weeks"".  I'm not sure how you managed to get into an incubator with no technical person or whether your technical person bailed, but it's a big red flag.  If you are a business-only team - what do you bring to the table that the next MBA doesn't?<p>2) Programmers hate working on crappy code
Since we don't know who wrote your code (outsourced to India, an old partner that left?) but we know that you -have- code (""manage all the code and technology behind our product for 12 weeks"") then odds are we're going to be walking into a hunk of junk.  And worst of all, the idea guys are probably going around telling everyone that it's 90% completed even though it's a crap pile.<p>Again, I don't mean to be a downer (too much).  If they're getting plenty of good submissions, then clearly it's just me.  But it sounds like they may be having trouble finding someone, and I think this is why.  I often see business-founders who can't figure out why they can't attract a good technical person.",1282161252

I don't quite agree with the conclusion as a real solution.  It's too late in my opinion.  We can't start over and have such dramatic pricing changes.  In fact, I am appalled to see prices going up (VeriSign increasing prices 7% annually for no reason in a contract that wasn't competed for).  Prices should be going down.<p>As far as negotiations and tracking down buyers... it varies.  I've done domain investing for a living for many years.  Most people big or small are quite easy to contact.  Some big guys are a real pain to deal with (it's not worth their time to sell even for a few grand).  Some small guys are more than happy to sell a name they no longer use.  I cannot generalize from my experience which type is better/worse/harder/easier/etc.  It's as unique as the domain you want.<p>Finally, most of these people aren't squatters.  Squatters are violating someone's trademark, property owned by someone else.  Using Beer.com and saying someone is squatting on such a name is complete and utter bullshit.  It's a generic word, it's not being cybersquatter unless someone has a TM for beer on its non-generic purpose and that is what they are using the domain for.  Thanks.",1282161182

Really!
You can buy something and use the name ""Elvis Presley"" on an online store, and no one will ever know.
I've talked to Authorize.net, PaySimple, PayPal- No one checks name.  The banks don't support it.<p>Here's the good news-
There are companies who can do it for you- RSA, Verisign, Equafax, and a half dozen others can do a background check on people for you, and as part of that they can verify their name. 
Get ready to pay, though, and it's not cheap.
Quotes range from $500-2000/month, plus $1-$5 per lookup.
These engines are normally used by debt collectors to come after you, if you're behind on a payment.<p>They'll also need to verify your Company Bank Account, founding Documents, and have a personal guarantee, since it's sensitive information.<p>There are ways to do it without going through that, though- The easiest way is to send a letter to their house.
If you send ""Certified Mail, Restricted Delivery"", then it has to be signed for, and it has to be signed for by the person in question.
Not only does this make it difficult for them to fake it, if someone else signs it for them, it's a Federal Crime!<p>You could send out letters with a one-time code on each of them, and then have people use that to Verify the registration.<p>I'd love to talk more about your project, I may be able to help you out, since I just went through the work of building it, using the Credit Companies ;)

Much of it is about honesty and trust.  Beyond relevancy, most of us have learned to distrust and ignore ads.  Certainly even in traditional media, the U.S. has had lower standards as far as claims and truthfulness go.  So the credibility value of ads has declined.  Of course trust for vendors online with no physical address or phone number (not that a phone means much anymore) will be even lower.<p>It really hit me a while back when talking to someone dealing with selling hardware and landscape supplies.  He went on and on about the great results he got advertising on Spanish speaking radio compared to other stations (rural area in California, not a major station).  The audience, much of it illegal aliens, regards the station as a trusted friend compared to the rest of the world around them.  Some of the trust rubs off on the advertisers.  (This was a long time ago, I'm sure the trust has eroded some)  Looking at Spanish radio was a bit like looking back in time at English speaking stations and earlier days in media.<p>We're in an era where the public sees through most online sites as being there solely to make money by nearly any means, not out of any love for a particular skill or interest and desire to make a living from it.<p>The shift from local owners to large corporations or VC groups has accelerated the shrinkage of trust in broadcast media.  The anonymous or corporate behavior of most online sites is even worse.  Unless you've acted in a way to make people love you, you're more apt to be ignored.  (There's a major lesson to learn from Apple here!)<p>How many sites actually care if their advertisers are a good thing for their readers?  How many sites don't support data-mining of their viewers?<p>If you treat your readers as hog bellies to sell to advertisers they'll grow to hate you.  Look at how many people feel towards broadcast tv.  (NBC stands out)

But if you don't have one decided, and don't need one, you linger on it untill the prior is true).<p>Now, as I said before, I'm undecided, and what is really scary is knowing that we basically jump into a job, with little to no real world experience (not theoretical or technical knowledge, we get that through school) about the career. Internships, would be the closest to what I'm thinking about looking for, but we have to compete for the one's that we want, our dream jobs may not even be looking for interns, and we're basically restricted to one per summer.<p>Perhaps what would help is a program, that allows for an array of different jobs, that you jump from each month. Assuming if your interested in the career, you would have some technical knowledge about it, and that there are enough companies signed with the program to allow the plethora of jobs.<p>Okay I'm probably talking out of my a- ...bum, because it'll have the same problems, and I'm sure there are those out there to tell me it won't work.<p>But I am here, decisions pending.",1282159389

Also, the set of skills needed to perform the function of piloting bombers (where one is also given extensive training in those skills) is not necessarily the same set of skills needed for making career choices and navigating through life where the acquisition of those skills is a lot less clear.

My first car, an '86, got low 30's, and with a tune-up some owners got higher than 35. So, be wary of the studies you read comparing new car mpg to old car mpg. My car got better or equal gas mileage compared to everything but hybrids like the Prius and Insight, and those are not representative of modern cars. I would bet the studies you have been reading have been comparing Insights (70mpg, and actually made since 1999) to 80's Corvettes (14mpg) or something along those lines.",1282158586

It isn't hard to maintain an atmosphere of egality and shared sacrifice when there's no money to go around. Once the company is flush with profits, the founders are looking at a big payoff, and management is drawing full salaries, telling employees to continue on as if nothing as changed will eventually lead to discontent. Building a new office probably seemed like the easiest way to address all the complaints that had arisen after the company ceased being a startup, and became a success.",1282158174
