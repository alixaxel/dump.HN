I spent a few years writing professionally and have a somewhat thick skin of my own when it comes to the editing pen, so pardon if I'm a little insensitive in the suggestions.<p>* You are, genuinely, missing a few 'open your browser, hit this port and try it' bits per Twitter. yes we're looking at the same doc, but I think you're presuming people will actually open their browsers and look at the <a href=""http://localhost:6767/tests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:6767/tests</a> or whatever, rather than being told to do so. You also don't show or mention what people can expect to see when they visit this. Throw a screenshot in.<p>* The sections about Steve and Knuth, sysadmins who can't code, and alternative inits you've tried but not liked, can be removed. They distract from the topic at hand. I read the bit about 'insulting to keep you interested' but it doesn't lend the doc character: it comes off like you're bitter, and doesn't help the end user actually set up Mongrel.<p>* For config, first show people how to configure mongrel using the default Python config file. Once you've done that <i>then</i> point out that they can create their own config formats if they don't like Python or want to automate stuff. Mention MVC if you want, restrict it to one sentence at the end. The aim is to making a working web server - anything asides from that gets in the way. See Kathy Sierra's stuff about 'helping users be awesome' for some good info on this.<p>* Be specific. 'Hacking' could be 'making web apps with Mongrel 2'. Per Twitter 'hacking' is ambiguous - think of the HACKING file in every GNU app which discusses modifying the program itself, rather than using it.<p>With a bit of editing, the current daunting manual could be about 50% the size.",1280739059

1567168,comment,1566278,1567068,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Take monads. The only way to ""get"" monads is to realize that they are just sections of the program that are imperative.</i><p>Not really.  Monadic function composition is just like regular composition, except that the programmer is given the ability to make ""f of g of x"" do something more than just pipe the result of g(x) into f.  This can look like imperative programming, but it's still purely functional.<p>If you're willing to call monads Kleisli arrows instead, then you can even the same syntax to chain monadic computations as ""regular"" computations.<p>For example, write a function to add one to a number, then multiply by 4:<p><pre><code>   f :: Num a => a -> a
   f = (*4) . (+1)
</code></pre>
That's a normal function, with the normal function composition operator.<p>Now write a function to increment the state, in a stateful computation, by a number:<p><pre><code>   inc :: Int -> State Int ()
   inc x = put . (arr (+x)) . get
</code></pre>
Even though State is a monad or Kleisli arrow, you can treat the stateful computation as regular function composition, because it is just composition.  There is no imperative programming anywhere to be seen.  Although operating on some hidden state feels imperative, it's not.  (Under the covers, it is a bit different than what you might be used to.  Each stateful function is really a function from its arguments to another function from the current state to the result.  We compose the ""result"" functions into one big function from state to result.  This involves a bit of plumbing, but the actual implementation is only two lines of code.  And it makes for a very useful abstraction in many cases.  But I digress...)<p>Monads are just a way to make similar things, chaining computations with an arbitrary combinator, look similar in your code.  We did it with State above, and there are lots of other things that work similarly.  Computations that can return zero or more results, computations that can fail, computations that operate on transactional memory, etc.  We use ""Monad"" (or ""Arrow"") to provide the programmer with a common syntax for interacting with each.  That's all a monad is.<p>(IO is weird, and it is a monad, but it could also be an applicative functor, or comonad, or arrow, or a lazy list, or.  Don't extrapolate your knowledge or fear of the IO monad onto monads in general.)",1280737486
