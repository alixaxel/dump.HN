1625619,comment,1624770,1624770,0,0,AmitinLA,,,"Tyler Cowen of Marginal Revolution has an interesting real-world analogue when he has to deal with q&a during his public speaking event. He believes that people are behaving in status-seeking ways and so forces people who want to ask questions to write them down and pass them up where he answers them anonymously[1]. Winer's 24-hour limit seems to be partially addressing this problem as well, but I agree with the comments already posted about that being too much time to care.<p>One possible solution I'm thinking about implementing in a new blog I'm starting is a separate Twitter comments account. This forces brevity and accountability among other things, and people could link to their own posts or places where my posts are (hopefully) being discussed. In addition, if the blog is successful, I could potentially see what comments are being retweeted, etc. and run some quick and dirty analytics to help determine high-value comments. Additional benefits would be connecting with high-value readers in a more intimate way that could improve dialogue as well as gently guide users to providing comments via email for longer dialogues. I'm concerned that 140 characters is too short to provide feedback, though the majority of comments I post on non-conversational sites seem to fit into that range.<p>Any thoughts?<p>[1] Sorry, I can't find a link to the article so I'm paraphrasing heavily.",1282527948
1625618,comment,1624486,1624486,0,0,morganpyne,,,"Once of my biggest pet peeves with Skype is the way presence notification permissions are handled. The default way to make contact with somebody seems to be ""add them to my contact list"" which then initiates a message exchange of ""Can I see when you are online"".  The problem with this is that and once granted, presence notification permissions live on the other person's computer and _cannot be revoked_. Removing them from your contact list does not prevent them seeing your online status and blocking them outright is the only solution. This is overkill however since I may wish to be able to receive calls/chats from them still but don't want to broadcast my online presence to them.<p>While I can of course change my status to invisible, this is a global setting and affects all my contacts. I now live in a permanent state of lurking on Skype, because so many business contacts have initiated contact with the ""can I see you online"" and would have taken offense if I simply said no.<p>In short, I would love to see better presence notification options in Skype including the ability to revoke permissions and to partition people into groups and assign a corresponding status to each group.",1282527906

1625613,comment,1625511,1625511,0,0,mansilla,,,"I recently stated this in another comment regarding payment systems.. I wouldn't rely on just one.  A merchant account through a bank CAN get suspended or put on hold if you trip any risk ratios (e.g. inquiries, chargebacks, refunds).  So, indeed, PayPal does have its share of stories of accounts being suspended without explicit reason; however, merchant banks have the same power and believe me when I say that they can lock/suspend your account, and hold your funds for 6 months without ANY detailed explanation and without interest.<p>Secondly, PayPal does have a new API called PayPal Adaptive Payments.  It's very flexible.. pre-approved payments, distributed payments (refunds also mapped backwards), chained payments (multiple source accounts for making payment).  Full details on their API PDF docs (easy to understand):<p><a href=""https://cms.paypal.com/cms_content/US/en_US/files/developer/PP_AdaptivePayments.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cms.paypal.com/cms_content/US/en_US/files/developer/...</a><p>So, even if you don't feel all warm and fuzzy about PayPal.. you should have an account handy, and think about having it as a payment option on your site.  Some users swear by it because they don't have to share any sensitive credit card information (including CVV coddes) with the merchant.",1282527632
