1632052,comment,1631682,1632025,0,0,_delirium,,,"True, although the spending is down from 1985-1990 levels even without the per-student calculation. It doesn't seem to be for explicitly partisan reasons either, since the UC system was well-funded under Deukmejian (a Republican) and then had its funding cut under Wilson (also a Republican).<p>Interestingly, most of the faster-than-population enrollment surge is in the past 5 years. If enrollments had grown from 1970 to 2000 in line with the results of the 1970 census versus the 2000 census, they would've been 124,000 in 2000, which is not that much lower than the actual 141,000 (that's only a 15% growth in enrollment rates over 30 years).",1282711880

Kurzweil's endgame is immortality via Singularity, and that affects his expected utility greatly. He actually gains when he spends two hours and ten dollars to gain one hour of expected lifespan when he has the expectation of eventually going infinite on lifespan via non-nutritional means. Most doctors, and most patients, don't expect the same eventual Singularity that Kurzweil is betting on, and without that expected payout, the supplements very likely seem ineffective in both time and cost efficiency. Most doctors seem hesitant to recommend courses of action that don't introduce significant qualitative (e.g., diabetes vs. no diabetes) or quantitative (orders of magnitude) returns.<p>(There's also the bit of cognitive dissonance where doctors are fine with heart transplants, but less fine with things that ""artificially"" extend lifespan or otherwise mess with our ""natural"" life.)",1282711867

You have to be on your feet actually interacting with kids who don't want to be there for 6-7 hours a day. God help you if you are teaching them something they instinctively hate, like math. The grading and prep is time consuming but not a big deal, you can just do it at home while doing something else. It's low prestige, and the pay is lousy. The pay becomes tolerable if you can stand doing it for 15 years while paying for bogus master's degree classes during the summers. I decided to abandon my bleeding heart and go back to graduate school in computer science. Note: if you want to get paid more off the bat, the trick is to get a master's degree right away and become a special-ed teacher.<p>In contrast, at almost every programming job I've had there were weeks where I spent 6-7 hours a day doing fuck-all, going to meetings, reading websites, chatting with friends and checking in 10 lines of code and updating the ticket tracker.

I still prefer visiting (and definitely developing) websites that are basically just a bunch of hypertext documents—the kind of sites where URLs point to resources and don't change, HTTP methods make things happen, and (almost) every click of a link or button causes a synchronous request/response to/from the web server.<p>Now of course, there is at least a modicum of hypocrisy in my statement.  A few ""web apps"" are nearly indispensable.  Right now, Gmail is the only one I can think of, and the only ""web app"" out of the ~25 sites on my browser's bookmark toolbar.  Everything indeed works perfectly, but I can't imagine how nasty the code behind it is (please, someone correct me if I'm wrong).<p>Lastly, I completely understand the main advantage of ""web apps.""

1632020,comment,1631049,1631763,0,0,_delirium,,,"That's an explicit Java patent grant separate from the open-sourcing (note the 2000 date, long predating OpenJDK). The exact patent status of OpenJDK is somewhat murky, though. Some people (incl. some lawyers) think that there's an implicit patent grant in the GPL, because the GPL explicitly prohibits distributing under the GPL any software that does not have all relevant patents licensed under royalty-free licenses. So if you gave someone a license to use your software under the GPL but <i>didn't</i> give them license to use a relevant patent, your licensing is self-contradictory: you will be simultaneously giving them a license to use your code under the GPL, and then that license is immediately terminated by the GPL's Section 7.<p>Therefore it's <i>possible</i> that a court might infer that giving someone a GPL license must imply a patent grant, because it would be absurd to assume that the licensor intended to give a license that was immediately self-terminating.<p>Courts do generally try to avoid interpretations of parties' actions that would assume they were meaning to undertake null or self-contradictory actions. But I'm not sure how much I'd bet on that outcome.<p>edit: Forgot another unlitigated possible angle. It's one thing to open-source something with a very explicit reservation of patent rights, like ""this source code may be used under the terms of the [license], but Sun reserves any rights to patents that may cover portions of the software, which must be licensed separately"". But what if you open-source it with a more blanket statement? With the OpenJDK release, there was a lot of rhetoric about openness from Sun, that amounted to: Java is now open source, you may use it for anything you want, as long as you comply with the terms of the GPL. It's possible that a ""here, use this for free if you want"" offer implies a license of any patents needed to use it. At the very least, it'd be somewhat dishonest to go up to someone and say, ""hey, I've got this great thing you can use... here I'll give it to you free"", and then come back five years later and accuse them of violating a patent. I mean, <i>you're</i> the one who gave it to them in the first place and told them it was okay to use it! So this might either imply a patent license, or at least present some sort of ""inducement"" or ""estoppel"" defense to a patent suit.",1282710854

If these old duffers could whistle the tune after hearing the record once, they knew the song stood a good chance of becoming a hit. They called it ""the old grey whistle test"".<p>I am increasingly of the opinion that the single most valuable asset to any consumer software company is at least one ""old grey"". The more time I spend with ordinary end-users, the more I realise that I cannot even begin to comprehend their mental processes.

But in any case:<p>As a spinoff from some machine-learning research on estimating different properties of graphs given incomplete information on other properties, was working on a service that would estimate travel times at different times of day given only fairly high-granularity crowdsourced information. You'd put in a fairly course route for your commute (e.g. I-85 at [exit] to I-285 W, exit [blah], take road west to [major intersection]), then enter data like ""left at 7:35am, took my saved route Morning Commute, and it took 22 minutes"". From many such users, hopefully with overlapping commutes ;-), it'd back out estimates of how long different segments and intersections between segments would take at different starting times, along with some nice interval estimates (""90% of the time, this route around 9am takes between 9 and 23 minutes, median 17""). Possibly other error-type estimates also: a big interest was that a curve showing mean travel time is missing a lot of the story, since backups due to accidents are very irregular (a route might take you 10 minutes almost every day, but 90 minutes sometimes... how frequent are those delays, and how long?).<p>It failed, due to a mixture of not enough time spent ramping it up, competitors, and a misprediction on technology that would've sunk it anyway. The not-enough-time was that we were building it as a side-project while in grad school. It wasn't even really anyone's thesis, and had no full-time employees, so it really was a side project, which made things slow. Fortunately or unfortunately, the bigger problems were that competitors and misestimates of technology would likely have sunk it anyway.<p>Google Traffic launched pretty early into development. It didn't do nearly what we were planning: even today you can't use it to get nice traffic-time curves at different times of day and different days of the week. But it did bite out a chunk of low-hanging fruit, covering both the common ""what's traffic like now?"" use case, using real-time sensors we don't have access to, as well as a generic take on the time-estimate problem (the Google Maps ""up to N minutes in traffic"" thing).<p>The technological misestimate was that we thought there was a bigger window before ubiquitous GPS with easy upload of data made this kind of inference from courser data unnecessary. We were working on this around 2006, and expected it to be maybe 2010 before that kind of thing was at all common, but it began becoming reasonably common in 2007, and exploded with the iPhone 3g and first Android devices in 2008. Obviously if you can take direct readings all along a route, you don't need any fancy estimation to back out segment estimates from whole-route timings.<p>Unfortunately, I don't know of any website where the kind of data we had wanted to make available is actually available currently. Can I go somewhere, put in ""I-280 from CA-85 to I-380"", and get a 24/7 curve showing me how estimated travel time varies by day of the week and hour of the day, ideally with some interval bands?<p>edit: Partly answering my last question, it seems the city of Atlanta actually does give you some traffic curves. They don't show a whole lot of data, but they do provide some aggregated curves for weekday rushhours as of about a year ago for various segments of the freeway system: <a href=""http://www.georgianavigator.com/histdata/trip.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.georgianavigator.com/histdata/trip.shtml</a>",1282709634

I think that the point about taxes is that the debate around taxes has essentially become petty and mean-spirited.<p>If a politician wants to raise taxes (in any way, even on the wealthiest 1 or .1%, who would barely notice), countless will bitch about it, without regard for data or reason (or common sense). It will be a knee jerk reaction.<p>WRT to his assumptions, I don't think that he is assuming that California is not spending its money wastefully (see his mention of the penal system). There is an argument to be made, however, that it is incredibly difficult to reclaim wasteful spending that has already been done. (California is not going to pardon 60% of its prison population and close its prisons or cancel state pensions).<p>So the expedient solution, if you believe in spending more on education and social services, would be to tax more.\n(but no politician in their right mind would say that).",1282709611
