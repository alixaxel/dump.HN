1633205,comment,1632878,1632878,0,0,joshuacc,,,"1. The idea that we are capable of freely deciding between alternatives seems to be built into our psyches. Absent <i>compelling</i> evidence to the contrary, it is rational to believe this intuition.<p>2. While there may indeed be scientific evidence against free will, the article that you linked doesn't seem to provide it. Just because decisions happen at a preconscious level doesn't mean that the decision was unfree. For instance, if I'm playing a very intense video game, I tend to make split-second decisions with no conscious decision making. That doesn't mean I didn't choose what to do in the game. It just means that discursive thought isn't essential to free choice.<p>3. If you're religious, then you could consider God a sort of ""guarantor"" of free will.",1282751943

When property values are still way over-inflated?<p>Depends.  In general when everyone is panic selling you want to be buying.  Obviously you never want to be buying crap (bad stocks, bad property, bad anything), but the panic times open up great opportunities for those with cooler heads.<p>Looking specifically at property many people still need places to live, but again it comes down to good versus bad.  Should I invest in an apartment complex out in the middle of the desert, probably not.  If I find a good deal on a complex in a city near a college, now we're talking.  Rates are currently low and a lot of people are being forced into selling which makes many prices low.  You can also look at the financials of a rental property and value it much easier than say a residential house.  Examining a rental property is much closer to examining a business than pricing residential.<p>Now, the above ignores the work that goes into owning rental properties.  Depending on the income level your property targets you may end up spending a full day in court every month throwing people out.  Does the owner of the property have the stones to throw out a mother and her kids because they don't pay?  Then you have repairs and other complaints.  You can get a company to handle most of this, but that does cut into your profit.",1282751534

1633109,comment,1630908,1630908,0,0,placer14,,,"A few remarks:<p>- The Scholar App sounds like a great idea, however I see a large hole in your business model. Your landing splash screen shows the differences between Bill (the average student) and Ted (the above-reproach student). You show the value proposition for a user like Bill (which, I assume, is getting help from students like Ted) but really don't provide incentive for a student like Ted to get involved. I would try to make this aspect more obvious in your screen cast. (Or change your somewhat misleading splash screen.)<p>- Don't make us watch you type directions. It really breaks the rhythm of your presentation and makes me want to fast forward (missing important info?) or close it altogether. Instead, have the information pre-copied and paste it from the clipboard (the low-tech way) or edit this out of the video.<p>- An important part of a screencast demo of an application is to give the user a brief experience of the application in action. I noticed in certain portions of your screen cast where you provide generic placeholder information (clearly for the purpose of the demo) however the placeholder data you used doesn't provide any idea of what information you mean to convey there. The example that was very obvious to me was the screen title of the Class ""Demo 101"" which read ""Demo 101 - The Scholar App Demo"". This is probably the Class Designation followed by the Class Title, but it's difficult to tell (at least for me) when it sits next to your app's logo.<p>This might seem like a small gripe, but you might as well make the most of the attention your screen cast is getting and give the clearest possible experience your users might benefit from when using your app. So instead (if my assumptions were right about the type of info you intended to display) you might display ""Demo 101 - Example Class Title"". Your users will recognize the ""Demo 101"" as the name of the course and the string ""Example Class Title"" will convey that they will know which course they are currently viewing (an important UX feature which someone might appreciate). You don't convey any LESS information than you did before and if you influenced at least one person to try your product then it was worth the change.<p>- It feels as though you haven't really practiced the presentation. It's noticable in your delivery. Nothing to do here but practice more. :)<p>Cheers!",1282750441

That said, I think I disagree on a few points:<p>1) Commercial real estate underwriting much more heavily weighs the fundamentals of the property as opposed to the borrower. As a result, it's possible that you could have a lender who would be comfortable with you carrying several times your net worth in loans, provided the underlying collateral fundamentals are strong.<p>2) I'm skeptical that a long-term diversified portfolio will only return 5%, <i>before inflation is taken into account</i>. This would correspond to a real return of 2%, which seems overly-conservative. Don't wealth managers advise safely withdrawing 4% per year to protect your principal and keep pace with inflation? I may be mistaken here.<p>3) I'm not as gung-ho about diversification as you are. I think it can make sense, but as Buffett has said, it's a hedge against ignorance. If you sell a startup for $20m, you were <i>highly</i> under-diversified before the sale, but that doesn't make it a bad idea. Nor would it be a terrible idea to roll a significant portion of that capital back into a business that you knew well enough that the risk profile was low <i>for you</i>.

Apologies in advance if my impressions did not capture what PG was trying to say -- I'm summarizing, not stenographing.<p>1)  Innovation<p>We've still got it, including making things that are not just ways to waste time on the Internet.  Evidence: sci-fi writers dramatically underestimate progress in our industry.<p>2)  Biotech<p>Sexy like cleantech, but doesn't require government subsidies to make money.  Also has competitive moat, because biotech is hard.  (Don't worry, software still worthwhile, too).<p>3)  Efficient markets<p>Free flow of information creates efficient markets where not possible before.  Many of our startups do this, such as AirBnB, an efficient market in lodging.  YC = ""mass production techniques, applied to VC""<p>4)  Measurement<p>""You make what you measure.""  Put a paper graph on the wall plotting your favorite metric.  You'll optimize for it, celebrate improvements, and shoot yourself in the foot if you picked the wrong metric.  Metrics show social customs are obsolete (like, e.g., display ads).<p>5)  The United States<p>PG was born in England, is not ""wild, jingoistic patriot"", but still thinks reports of US's impending obsolescence are greatly exaggerated.  The only thing that kills empires is when people can't make money by building stuff.  Three ways this can happen:<p><pre><code>  a)  Bandits steal the money.  (NYC)\n\n  b)  Your government steals the money.  (""The England that I escaped from."")\n\n  c)  Other countries steal the money.  (The Netherlands.)\n</code></pre>\nLeading candidate for toppling US is China.  PG seems skeptical.<p>6)  Silicon Valley<p>Budget crisis in California is two sets of idiots playing chicken.  You don't have to start in Valley, but it really, really helps.<p>7)  Small companies<p>World is ""higher resolution"": stuff gets done but it doesn't require industrial empires anymore.  Networked small organizations are more efficient.  Economies of scale paper over all the other sins of large corporations, but nimbleness of small companies means little guys win.<p>8)  Economic inequality<p>A network of small companies plus money not getting stolen will produce massive economic inequality.  (Patrick notes: PG's essay on wealth creation is my favorite of all he has ever written.  He has a convincing take on why massive economic inequality is a good thing, and it isn't based on trickle-down economics.)  If your business model bets on increasing economic inequality, good for you.<p>9)  Moore's Law<p>Computers getting better, but in uneven fashions (e.g. SSD, not ""all components improve 2 years"").  Programmers are lazy.  Companies which enable programmers to be lazy (i.e. not change practices or working code to benefit from uneven improvements) and get automagic speed increases win.<p>10)  Things On Screens<p>We spend a lot of time staring at screens.  Wider population spending more time staring at screens.  PG has a suntan from his monitor.<p>11)  Server-based apps<p>(I missed this one.)<p>12)  Super good customer service<p>Customers can switch easily, people are talking together more, so have such good customer service like it seems like a mistake.  Customers can now participate in design of products in virtually real time.<p>13)  Apparently frivolous stuff<p>Our startup founders use Facebook to talk to each other about work, not email.  ""Facebook has not found its monetization model yet"", haha.  This sort of adoption shows there is something really at work here.  ""It is surprisingly hard to do math that has no practical applications.""<p>PG skipped Twitter.  Can't get a good name on it, but it turns out Twitter is really useful as a ""non-deterministic messaging protocol.""<p>14)  Programming languages<p>There will be a succession of new, popular languages.  Use the next hot language.  You can be the guy who writes the library for such-and-such.  Server-based apps can now be cobbled together from multiple languages.  ""Super abstract languages, like the ones people successfully write applications in now, were once called 'scripting languages.'""<p>15)  OSS<p>I can't name a company which did too much OSS.  If no one has gone too far, we're probably not doing OSS enough yet.<p>16)  Linux will never be a factor on the desktop<p>Limiting edge of OSS is design.  Everyone thinks they are good at design.  Most people are not good at design: look at the contents of their houses.  What this means for the desktop: buy AAPL stock.<p>17)  iPhone<p>iPhone is a big deal, and I'm bummed because Apple are jerks.  There are two problems startups have that aren't their own faults: immigration and AppStore approvals.  They're like something out of Kafka.<p>(Sidenote: We're not giving our startups too little money: they can all afford iPhones.)<p>Android will be crushed under Steve Jobs' heels, because Apple cares about the iPhone like Google cares about search.<p>iPhone (or something similar) will do for laptops what laptops did to desktop.<p>18)  Design<p>Design is why the iPhone wins.  20 years ago, it would have been surprising to say American companies can beat Japanese companies in consumer electronics devices.  Core competency moved from manufacturing to design after people got microprocessors to shoot themselves in the foot with.  Plus, China commoditized manufacturing expertise.<p>19)  Real Time Stuff<p>Web 2.0 doesn't mean anything.  Real time does.  Google Wave will actually be important, not just somebody's 20% project.  It is like Google-branded Etherpad, and Etherpad is useful, so Wave will be a gamechanger.  See also Twitter, useful in a way different than Wave.  If you make the convex hull around Twitter/Wave, and see a space which is unoccupied, that is a worthwhile opportunity.<p>20)  VC<p>VC won't go away because VCs need to give you money.  They can make the terms arbitrarily better to put money in your pockets [Patrick notes: can't get 2 and 20 if you can't invest the money].  Great news for you, since [owners] will now have the market leverage.  Expect better valuations and board control.<p>21)  Founders<p>Founders will more and more have the upper hand.  Investors have learned firing the founders is a bad play.  More and more founders will be technical founders.  Programmers can learn to do business: make something people want, charge them money for it.<p>There should be an O'Reilley book for business.  It would be really short.  ""Make something people want, charge them money for it.  Advanced: charge more money.""<p>---<p>Trends Not To Bet On<p>1)  Credentials granted by institutions<p>Admissions officers are terrible.  Look at our applicants: college graduated from (and by implication, admitted to) does not predict success.  Not surprising: colleges admissions are impersonal evaluation of 17 year olds based on criteria which can be successfully gamed for money.  Credentials are an example of an illiquid market.  (Pagerank for people would be nice -- our startup doing it didn't work out.)<p>2)  Business school<p>B-school is West Point for industrial capitalism.  It trains generals, not footsoldiers.  Market now rewards people who can do stuff.  The kind of people who would be good teachers own their own businesses, became rich, and now have no reason to teach B-school.  Instead, we get folks who cannot do and are forced to teach.<p>3)  Government<p>The people on the bridge changes, but the engine room is the same as always.  There is an increasing disconnect between public and private sector: government and 1960s PG (Proctor & Gamble, not the other PG) fit each other like gloves, and now government does not match startups/software/etc much.  Folks want to work in electronic medical records: they're going to think bureaucracy is terribly slow.<p>4)  Copyright<p>""Don't start a music starup unless one of your co-founders is Johnny Cochran.""  Expect a long, bloody fight that the content industry loses.<p>5)  Restricted flow of information<p>Getting more liquid, faster.",1282749608

1633036,comment,1631284,1631428,0,0,hga,,,"Very interesting set of facts, observations and analysis.<p>One thing I'd add are the forces of supply and demand.  Here are my facts/observations about those in the US:<p>I'm not sure about other STEM professions, but the demand for programmers <i>skyrocketed</i> in the '80s with the supply of capable and necessarily cheap microprocessor based computers.  It's hard to express what a sea change this was, from wiring together discrete logic to being able to put an entire CPU on a single chip which massively decreased cost, increased reliability and in time allowed for very high preformance (compared to their discrete ECL high end competitors; for the most extreme example the initial Cray-1 announced in 1975 ran at 80MHz).<p>At the same time semiconductor DRAM allowed an explosion in the size of programs and all together these allowed an orders of magnitude <i>preformance</i> escape from the constraints that had been with us since, say, the very early 60s.<p>There were a variety of supply based responses to this including the 1990s? H1-B visa program; their success can be judged by the inflation adjusted wages earned by programmers and the post-dot.com crash in CS major enrollment (don't know about other schools but MIT lost more than half, in a department that had had steady and very high enrollment (40% of the undergraduates) since the beginning of the '80s or earlier).<p>I was personally on the science track in the late '70s (high school and first term of college) and I could by the end of that decade see the supply of biologists starting to outstrip the demand.  Chemistry might be weird since it became politically unfashionable by the end of the '60s, but physics certainly had an oversupply by the time that the US Superconducting Super Collier was canceled in 1993 (at least one MIT department had a line of students transferring out of the physics department into it on that day).<p>Yet starting sometime in the '80s the NSF began a <i>major</i> ""We don't have enough STEM workers!"" campaign that continues to this day.  Similarly we see executives like Bill Gates and Intel's CEOs (not just this one) demanding more foreign workers at a time of high unemployment and wage stagnation at best in the fields they're recruiting from.  One should also note that the last time I checked Intel has a policy of firing the ""bottom"" 1/10 of their employees every year so if they're still doing that (and officially or not, it would have become part of their culture) their annual recruiting requirements will therefore be rather extreme.<p>(That said, the very best are always scarce and hard to find, recruit and retain, but that relative handful is not what we or they are talking about.)<p>Anyway, I believe that due to the above supply and demand mismatches, prior to the start of the Great Recession the US was seeing a <i>major</i> drop in US originated students in STEM college majors (by that I mean not including say the children of 1st generation immigrants who often weren't clued into these major shifts, I'm assuming 2nd generation and beyond recognized what was happening) and it was far worse in graduate programs.<p>Of course the Great Recession is looking to be a great game changer as ones often are.  STEM careers may suck, but they could easily beat paying out of your own pocket for a law degree in a market that's crashed or for a doctor's education when we're at the brink of a ""fundamental transformation"" of America's medical system that includes a major obsession with decreasing costs (as it is, the government is already paying for almost half the nation's medical care...).",1282749221

Then I realized something that was even more important: it does not matter if it is true.  This is not a form of enlightenment that actually helps me or anyone.<p>Really, work through it.  Congratulations: you discovered that everything you think and do is preordained by the first energy patterns of the universe.  Now what?  Do you second-guess your decisions?  Isn't your second-guessing also preordained?  Isn't your so-called enlightenment also just a part of the system?  What does this knowledge really do for you?<p>Note that your quoted article does not oppose free will (unless you buy into the sensationalism).  It points to the idea that a part of your brain figures out your next action before you are fully conscious of that decision.  This does not invalidate free will; it just shows that you make decisions from multiple levels of your brain.  You do not want too much decision-making power, like when your heart should next beat.<p>So, accepting that it is useless to believe in lack of free will, what happens if you decide to place your faith in having or acquiring free will?  This opposite philosophy flows hand-in-hand with the idea of personal responsibility, the idea that you may actually be to blame for your own misfortunes and fortunes.  There is a certain liberty in realizing that you have the power of Choice, that you can simply choose to leave these perceived/accepted traps and social constructs.<p>In other words, it would be irrational to not operate on the assumption that you have free will.<p>tl;dr - This philosophy does not help anyone.

When I talk about income %, I'm talking about across an entire portfolio (that real estate should certainly be a part of).<p>So you're putting 25% of your cash down on a $5m property for $110k per year.  Nice!  How many such properties do you think the banks are going to let you buy?  With the future values of these properties a bit murky, I imagine that someone with 4-5m in the bank ISN'T going to get the green light to buy $21m in properties (4 difference loans to service).<p>People keep bringing up INDIVIDUAL investments that can net a great return (in this case, 9%).  That's missing the point.  With big piles of money, you have diversified holdings.  You're not going to drop 90% of your cash in real estate down payments.  Nor are you going to drop it all in stocks.  You're going to (generally) do a reasonable asset allocation to minimize the risk.  While I did mention the S&P500's performance for comparative purposes, I wasn't advocating for a pure stock portfolio (any more than you're advocating for a pure real estate portfolio).<p>As he says, real estate has plenty of risk.
