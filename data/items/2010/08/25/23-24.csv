If you can't distinguish Wikileaks from the Drudge report or Boing Boing then I'd say you're not the kind of person who would benefit from reading leaked copies of classified documents. Instead, I'd suggest you stick to articles in the New York Times or Washington Post or other major newspapers that are based on Wikileaks data. I mean, since all the big papers have been publishing articles that heavily use Wikileaks data, presumably they find WL to be somewhat trustworthy. Or do you have difficulty distinguishing between the NYT and the Drudge Report as well?",1282780733

1634567,comment,1634471,1634471,0,0,jonhohle,,,"> It’s interesting how a lot of companies try to copy Apple but never seem to get it right.<p>I think many companies see the features (windows flying around in Exposé, brightly colored window management buttons, pulsing status light, etc.) but don't understand that generally Apple doesn't just throw something in for looks and has thoroughly researched and iterated internally on a particular solution.<p>At the expense of sounding fanatic, generally an Apple feature looks the way it does as a result of its function. (What is the problem: make window management easy. how is that solved: make all open windows easy to see by spreading them out). When other companies attempt to copy, they look at what Apple's solution looks like, not realizing what it _does_. (e.g. Areo Flip 3D: what should it look like: windows flying all over the place. what problem does this solve: ???)",1282780350

1634560,comment,1632629,1634261,0,0,semanticist,,,"Council Tax in the UK isn't a percentage of the value of the property. It's an annual charge which varies according to the bank your property falls in.<p>A local council sets the charge for 'band C' (I think) and the rest are calculated from that. (This then pays for rubbish collection, libraries, all that sort of stuff.)<p>If you're buying a property as an investment, council tax isn't hugely relevant. If the property is occupied, the occupant pays it. (Unless they're exempt, like students are.) If the property is empty you don't need to pay it for up to six months.<p>So the tax does scale according to the value of your property (ie, your wealth) and is an attempt at progressive taxation, but it's not a direct tax on that wealth.<p>If you're buying investment property in the UK, your tax liability is going to be income tax on the income and capital gains tax if the market value of the property has risen. In addition you'll have to pay Council Tax based on the property you're living in, regardless of if you own or rent it.",1282780221

If you haven't seen it, it's worth watching - right at the center of Google's brief expressive / cute / minimalist advertising phase. Think back to the ""Parisian Love"" Super Bowl ad and the Motion Theory ""Google Chrome"" short.  They're delightful.<p>These shorts present Google as a very different company - one that's personal, bright, and helpful. Much of this work is coming from (or commissioned by) a division called Creative Lab that's largely independent from the majority of Google's culture and management structure.  I had the pleasure of collaborating with them on a couple projects and was amazed by their creativity, insight, and lighthearted approach.<p>I would love to see more work in this style from Google. They've demonstrated they're perfectly capable of creating very good ads that deliver a consistently solid impression, but have ceded much of the opportunity to brand Android to carriers who have screwed it up to the nines (though we shouldn't forget that the platform is actually called ""Android""), with the lone exception of HTC's highly personal commercials.<p>I hope they can turn it around.

For instance, to say that a high-end prostitute working fifteen hours a week is more like a trophy wife than like a street hooker is utterly oblivious to the many, many obligations a trophy wife has.  Being a trophy wife is, if not a full-time job, at least a half-time job.  A trophy wife has to fulfill all the expectations of a wife of her social class, and fulfill them exceptionally well.  She has to entertain.  She has to manage a household.  She has to manage her social life and social image, and often her husband's as well.  Often a trophy wife has to bear and raise children.  Of all the duties of a trophy wife, having sex with her husband is among the least essential.  I would wager it is the most negotiable, the most often neglected, and the least likely to cause serious dissatisfaction on the husband's part.
