1604416,comment,1603392,1603392,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"A good summary.  After several days of thinking about this I can only come to two conclusions, neither of which I like:<p>a)  Oracle is realizing that mobile is strategic and has decided this is how they will get in on the action.   They think it is much more important than Java.   They will force Google to license Java from them and that way gain not only royalties, but actual control of Android.<p>b)  This is purely about damaging Android.   There is an agreement we know nothing about yet between Apple and Oracle that if Oracle takes down Android something will happen in return from Apple.   They don't care if they win or lose, they just want to smash adoption of Android.  It could as easily be a move from MS but it is hard to think past the bitterness and sense of betrayal expressed by Jobs about Android, or the frequently reported ""close friendship"" between Ellison and Jobs.<p>I wish these were conspiracy theories but I can't account for Oracle's willingness to detonate what is still an incredibly valuable Java asset any other way.",1281836923

1604406,comment,1604315,1604315,0,0,asanwal,,,"1.  Can you contract out any elements of consulting work to others to free up time?  Perhaps some of the lower-value work?  You'll make the spread b/w the rate you get and what you pay them.  You'll profit less but gain incremental hours for your venture.<p>2.  Pick or find consulting work that ""scales well"" meaning it allows you to leverage (sorry for jargon) knowledge/things you've already done or built.  This type of work will be more efficient for you, more profitable and you can reinvest saved time into your startup.<p>3.  Regarding multiple startup ideas, I'd pick one to focus on.  Diversifying amongst startup ideas esp if unrelated doesn't work in my experience. It leads to doing them all half-baked which ultimately won't get you further from consulting which is where you want to be.<p>4.  As mentioned below, we treated our own company as a client which meant we acted with same sense of urgency as we would with other clients.  It is a good way to make your own venture a priority else it always gets back burnered.<p>5.  This one is a bit drastic but exit the mortgage if you can by selling your home and renting.  Fixed costs like mortgages can be like anchors for an entrepreneur.  Take the money you may make and put some away for a rainy day fund for the wife/kids/you and a portion can be used to give your own venture some additional fuel or runway.<p>In same boat as you my friend so ""feel your pain"" although sounds like you have too much consulting biz which is a high class problem IMO.<p>Good luck.  And if you figure out a ""solution"", pls let me know.",1281836624

If you're willing to accept a 64-bit hash function and you have 2 billion unique strings you'll need just over 16GB to do it all in one pass.<p>A 64-bit hash is is just barely enough for 2 billion items.  You might get a handful of collisions.  Add more bits to reduce the probability.  128-bits would double the required size to 32GB but you're unlikely to ever see a collision in your life time.<p>If 16GB or 32GB is too much you could do it in multiple passes.  Make N passes through the text file and adjust the range of hash values you accept to test only 1/N each time.<p>8 passes through the original file with a generous 128-bit hash would take only 4GB of RAM.<p>I have the feeling this is more work than you would want to put into the problem, though.",1281836598

This didn't make sense. If we are going to have a fair bankruptcy system, private education loans should be treated the same as other private consumer debt. That's the risk lenders take, similar to the risk borne by providers of loans for cars, homes or other consumer purchases.<p><a href=""http://edlabor.house.gov/edlabor_dem/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=11&limit=20&tag=student%20loan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edlabor.house.gov/edlabor_dem/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBl...</a><p>> Lenders receive a 97 percent guarantee against default losses, which removes almost all of the default risk of the loan to the lender. If a borrower does not repay his or her federal student loan, the government pays the lender 97 percent of the outstanding principal and all of the accrued unpaid interest. In other words, the lender assumes default risk for only 3 percent of the loan principal.<p><a href=""http://febp.newamerica.net/background-analysis/federal-student-loan-subsidies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://febp.newamerica.net/background-analysis/federal-stude...</a>",1281836217

I'm addicted to consulting right now and I've been using it to help bootstrap my startup ideas as well. I don't think I'll be backing off consulting until my startup ventures actually make as much money as my consulting and even then the consulting dollars will give me more options in promoting my startups!<p>I love the variety of consulting so much that even after my ventures bring success I will still want to do consulting because it gives me that instant achievement satisfaction.<p>Don't focus on breaking free from consulting and before working on any other ideas get that first product released. Set milestones and treat it like your other work.<p>I'm still consulting until I get my own projects off the ground, my first launch took 1.5 years to finish, my next launch will be in a fraction of the time.",1281835079

Companies like Google standing up and fighting on our behalf would have been the best possible solution but that didn't work out. I think the FCC is the last best hope.

It's the fact that you're playing Russian roulette in the first place that is putting you at risk of being shot. If people are confused about that, then it's probably best to educate them about how playing Russian roulette can result in you getting shot.<p>Bringing the analogy back, I feel like it would have been more useful to just educate people about the fact that creating Dalvik is what directly led to this suit and for what reasons.",1281834713
