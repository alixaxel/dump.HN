1604908,comment,1600337,1600337,0,0,kochbeck,,,"This is sort of a funny question because it's one where answers arising from the brashness of youth just sound brash. The strains of, ""The power is all in your hands,"" just don't ring as true when you actually have to sing them to someone who's trying to make life decisions. I had a recent failure, and I've crafted an exit strategy for just such occasions. Here's my pitch:<p>I've been an entrepreneur for most of my life. Aside from a brief stint at IBM where mostly people looked at me funny for two years, I've done ridiculously financially risky things just because I enjoy taking risks and seeing if I can make them come out. I'm like a compulsive gambler who bets the rent every month, except I place longer-term bets than the craps table, and I've beat the house more than half the time.<p>I published my first piece of code at 7, and it was for a TRS-80. Like most risk addicts, the #1 predictor of getting hooked is early success. Even if you're predisposed to being an adrenaline junkie, if you hurt yourself trying the first few times, you're done. Needless to say, the heroin of early success has a particularly acute effect on a 7 year old.<p>I tried a lot of stuff over time, some of it way out of my league, some not worth trying, some just dumb, and some a bad fit for the exigent circumstances of life and market. Those were the losers, and I've been kicked in the balls hard many times by betting on losing ideas, bad plans, lousy partners, conniving vendors, bad customers, and, more than anything, my own personal triumph of hope over cold, hard experience.<p>I also have just enough successes to keep me hooked. But on average, I'm not a whole lot better off financially than many of my 9-to-5er friends. My years where I turned over a lot of personal income are offset by the years when I don't, for sure. So for me, it just isn't about wealth. It's about the one place where I have the 9-to-5ers beat: that where they say, ""Wouldn't it be cool if somebody..."" I live my life being able to say, ""Isn't it cool that I did?"" But that's not the life for everybody. Most folks need the sense of security and uniform societal justification that being one more cog in the machine brings. I've never personally valued or had either.<p>So I totally blew a startup project I was working on for over a year. All but abandoned it a couple months ago. It was just too complex to fund, and it was a regulatory nightmare. I personally lost most of my net worth on the miscalculation. Oops. (On the bright side, I didn't lose anybody else's money, so I came out with as many friends as I went in with.)<p>And, of course, it flamed out at the height of the biggest recession in generations, so I was left fairly idle. I moped. I piddled. I taught myself to cook. I toyed with other backburner ideas I've let simmer for a long time. I did a fair bit of nothing and pretended it wasn't awful and painful and embarrassing and deflating and demoralizing. I'd trot out Michael Jordan's, ""I've missed more than 9000 shots..."" quote in my head and try to ignore that he was Michael Jordan and I wasn't.<p>The other day, I was talking with a recruiter friend of mine, and he said that it would be easy to get me a real job (gasp, choke). Suggested that I join his big company, do something simple, and let them pay for grad school in some subject area that I enjoy but doesn't necessarily have any commercial value. Get paid to hang with folks and just think for a few years. So I considered it. I even began the application process.<p>Then, I talked to a line manager at the company my recruiter friend works for (because I do my homework), and the guy related to me how much trouble they have managing the line because they have very weak procedures and no training on the line as to how they'd develop procedures.<p>My response was: ""Well heck, I've been wanting to do some Android development, and you guys all have Android phones. I'll just build you an app to support your line management. I'll learn Android on a non-trivial project, and you'll get to know me.""<p>The point (and I do have one) is that even my personal risk management behaviors are colored by entrepreneurial behaviors. I'm thinking of taking a 35-hour per week job to pay me to go hang out at a school and pay the rent, and I somehow manage to turn my job interview into new development and a mini-enterprise applications project. It's just who I am now.<p>I have a lot of respect for people who walk away from the startup game and go act like normies - I know tons of 'em, and I know that almost all of them miss the exhilaration and the sense that every time they come to work, they have a chance to move the needle. I can't seem to let myself give up that rush, and I really don't want to. I have no problem picking up high-paying work when I need it, but that's a function of having cultivated skills that have value no matter what kind of job I take - startup or secure (consulting, of course). I'm confident that if push came to shove and I needed to walk away, I could. I have a steady stream of job offers to prove it.<p>Churchill said that success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Of course, he won his war, so he would say that. And forums like HN are rich in first-attempt winners because there's an audience for them. So they've been as immunized to failure as a published 7-year-old. If you get into startups and totally flame out, assuming you can tolerate failure like a fully-formed adult (seriously, be sure you can), you might end up taking a pay cut if you decide to leave for higher ground. You might end up leaving for something deadly boring. But any losses you incur will probably be temporary, relatively minor, and non-fatal.<p>Or maybe you'll get hooked, and your life will just stay interesting. If you live by the Chinese curse, ""May you live in interesting times,"" then don't do it. If you think that's a blessing and not a curse, go for it.",1281868531
1604907,comment,1604583,1604583,0,0,jdietrich,,,"There is a much steeper cost to parking - the effects on public space. The provision of surface-level parking reduces urban density, making cities less walkable, bringing with it an array of other social problems.<p>In the parts of Europe where people walk and cycle, there has necessarily been an aggressively anti-car policy. In London there is a daily charge of $12 just to drive into the city. This congestion charge has strong public support due to the obvious and substantial quality-of-life improvements it has brought. A well-located car park can easily charge $70 a day. In denser parts of London, residents are charged fees by the local government for the right to park in front of their own houses, many people lease out driveway space and a single car garage in the most prestigious areas can sell for as much as $300,000. Many towns and cities in Italy have completely banned non-essential motor vehicles from the city centre - often the old city walls form a natural division. Of course, gasoline in most of Europe has cost in excess of $6 a gallon for years.<p>I'm not arguing that this is a superior way of running things, it is simply a difference in priorities, but the costs of car use are far greater than I think most Americans would recognise. To many of you, our high gas prices, expensive parking and restrictive regulations must be quite shocking. Our small towns must seem almost unreal in their quaintness, in the age of their infrastructure, in their density. Most of us drive vehicles of comically small proportions. By the same token, many of us find cities like LA and Houston to be frightening, Ballardian places. We are shocked at the priority given to cars, at the lack of sidewalks and the sheer sprawl of such cities. By the standards of most European governments, the average American city is practically uninhabitable and would be torn down and started anew. We both pay a steep price for our cars; The price we pay is more obvious to you, but the price you pay is more obvious to us.",1281868511

You cannot rewrite them with an extra case because you can't rewrite all the calling sites, because those are baked into executable binaries.<p>The world of shrink-wrapped closed-source software may be a foreign world to many functional advocates, but it's the world I live in, and extensibility here is often done with polymorphism and inheritance. The code in the closed-source kernel (application, framework, whatever) interacts with values polymorphically, with modules and third parties relying on inheritance and overriding to work their behaviour into the system.<p>You want a market for components, where both buyers and sellers are protected; sellers do not necessarily want to reveal their source code, and buyers especially don't. Binary, executable code is the medium of interchange. In order to fit these things together you need protocols: sets of expected messages and documented responses. OO polymorphic interfaces, in other words. Inheritance at the interface level is necessary, and at the implementation level it decreases the burden somewhat - using aggregation instead can lead to problems of identity (the sub-parts of an aggregate each have a different one, since they are mutable).",1281867017
