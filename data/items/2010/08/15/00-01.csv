1604302,comment,1603562,1603562,0,0,znt,,,"Here's my story about English and Japanese. I started learning English in preschool and kept learning in till I graduated from college. I liked to study English but my real skills came from playing pc games and watching MTV. I used to watch about 2 hours a day when I was 15 or so. Basically playing games and watching someone speak that language helps with comprehension a lot.<p>I started learning japanese in college, there were 4 lessons per week, I was doing well with the grammar but spoken part was kind of stuttering rather than fluent speaking. So after 2 years of study one day my japanese instructor asked me a favor: She wanted me to help her friend's daughter study english. The girl spoke very little English. I was expected to teach that girl English in Japanese. At first I couldn't decide if she was playing a joke on me to see my reaction. When I realised she was serious, I told her that was practically impossible as I was not fluent in japanese and it might have been a problem. She just said ""I believe in you, you'll do well"". I said ""What the hell let's give it a try, at most I'll fail miserably and have a story to tell how I pissed off an entire japanese family"".<p>So, for 4 hours a week,  I started studying with this girl, aged 12, with only a small english-japanese dictionary in my hand. She also had a similar dictionary, but it was digital and able to convert between kanji-hiragana-katakana and English. Probably it was from the future and could read also read our thoughts. Anyways vocabulary wasn't a problem but communication was. I was speaking slowly when I tried to explain basic English grammar. But day by day, my speaking got more fluent and after about 3 months or so, I was able to read a basic english text and translate it into japanese simultaneously, sentence by sentence. I guess the lesson here is sticking with the practice on an ongoing basis. I want to stress that 9 months of study with that girl advanced my japanese much further than the previous 2 year study as I was actively speaking most of the time.",1281832497

1604299,comment,1603583,1604000,0,0,tmsh,,,"<i>BSD's problem is that most progress gets entombed in proprietary forks. It was inevitable that a GPL'd kernel, being immune to that problem, would catch up and displace it.</i><p>How I read it, fwiw, is that kernel development involves a lot of drivers, and benefits heavily from a leaf-heavy committer structure. Which is what Linux is built on (even if it's perhaps less elegant at the top, with one or two people arbitrating everything instead of the FreeBSD teams, etc.). But I imagine BSD might've adapted / grown a more driver-amenable tree structure if there weren't legal pressures in their inception.<p>Perhaps I'm naive, but I don't know how important the GPL was to Linux's success. I think it's a hugely important piece of history -- and a very active one. But the resulting forces from legal outcomes in technology -- they're just so momentuous. Think of other industries. What other industries cycle through major corporations every decade? I mean, that's 4-5 major shifts since personal computing was even thought of. Is it just the rapid speed of technology driving things?<p><i>Your overall thesis relies on innovative work being immune from patent holder attacks.</i><p>That's a good point. But my point is that the day you sign up for a patent is the day you've tapped someone else to beat you. And you could go even further and say, the day that happens, you've spurred the next great technology.<p>The day you go anywhere near the law is the day you've crested around exponential growth. The law is too slow. Technology is too fast. But Google would have to detach themselves totally from any form of greed to realize that. I doubt they will, even though I can't think of a single technology firm (in the past 60 years) that has grown exponentially after engaging in a legal fight voluntarily.<p>That said, the points you make are interesting and perhaps more pertinent than the kind of crazy long-term theorizing that I am rather fond of.<p>ETA. One more point. BSD, by actively avoiding any type of legal engagement (i.e., allowing proprietary use via their licensing) -- which decision arguably was a direct result of their involvement in the 90s legal battles -- may prove in the long-run to be something that pushes its adoption further than Linux. BSD ironically forms the basis for iPhones and iPads and all that -- but is it still BSD? It's curious though because whatever it is -- it seems like technology swiftly moves around whatever legal engagements are in place. Whether or not this is a good thing, and whether we should protect free software for the long run, I don't know.",1281831264
