Most people who play games do so as an escape, not as a proxy for real life power politics. If nothing else, any game content dependent on loss mechanics tend to become avoided by players past a certain user base size, as they figure out which game content is lower risk. (Grinding boss runs and the like, for example.) Yes, for some players, this isn’t “fun,” but game designers have to focus on where the majority of gamers who provide the monthly fees or “freemium” content.<p>EVE is the only MMO I’m aware of that avoided this problem, but it has done so at the cost of being confined to a very tight user community with limited prospects for growth or mainstream awareness. EVE doesn’t sound very fun to me; the requirement to make corps (guilds in other games) and be beholden to your peers makes the social stress requirement worse than public school and megacorp office work in my mind.",1281332611

If P!=NP, that is obeyed by the brain as much as by computers and whatever trick our brains does to be creative despite of this, will be available to computers as well, regardless of P?=NP. What am I missing?</i><p>Let's talk math: In some very formal, reductionist sense, what we're doing when we do math is to start with a set of axioms, operate on them using a fairly small set of logical rules, and arrive at theorems that seem interesting.<p>If we do this very carefully -- much more carefully than a human would ever normally do, showing 100% of our work -- it's trivial to <i>check</i> such a proof automatically. You just look at each step, and verify that that step follows from the axioms + logical rules you're using + previous steps. This checking is clearly (<i>handwave</i>) polynomial: at worst, at each step N, you have to examine every axiom, every logical rule, and each prior step to make sure that step N+1 is legal.<p>So proof checking is in P.<p>Let's say I have a set of axioms, and a logic, and I want to know whether a theorem T is true given that system. One strategy I could use is to decide to only consider proofs of length less than N, and generate every legal theorem that I can reach in fewer than N logical steps. When I'm done, I check my list of proven theorems and see if any of them match T. Since I can always my answer in polynomial time, I know this is in NP.<p>The try-everything-possible algorithm has the downside of being a bit exponential (since we expect N to be very (very!) large for any interesting theorem) and so also a bit useless.<p>But what if a P=NP proof can provide guidance on how we should combine our axioms in order to reach theorem T? We suddenly have not a proof-checker, but a proof-generator! Anything that we can state in a formal language, we can simply ask the prover to prove -- it will either give a proof, or say that a proof of size < N doesn't exist. (<i>That wouldn't be a disproof, and it's a Goedel/halting problem kind of argument that we may never really know how large N needs to be.</i>)<p>Finding new proofs is a large part of what's considered creative in mathematics. It's hard to over-state how math might change with a tool like that available. The field has seen any number of revolutions before -- e.g., the effort of hundreds who worked on the algebraic roots of polynomials pretty much only survives in homework exercises nowadays -- but automating proofs would be Big.<p>(Finding interesting conjectures is valuable, too, but I doubt Erdos would be nearly as famous if he'd only posed his questions without his resume of theorems behind them.)",1281332565

That might be the smartest thing to do with your savings but it doesn't change the calculus fundamentally.<p>Buying a house with a suitcase full of cash or getting a zero-amortization (infinity-year, ie, interest-only) mortgage or anything in between is all roughly financially equivalent if you have alternative investments available.<p>Actually the longer the mortgage term the bigger total tax deduction you get, so in that sense the more you pre-pay the costlier it is.",1281332534

1587111,comment,1584253,1585831,0,0,kls,,,"Yes sorry, RIA is JavaScript to me. I mainly work on web-apps, and they are JavaScript intensive. The security constraints but in say that accessing services.mydomain.com is like accessing yourdomain.com so JavaScript balks at it because it views it a a cross site call. So fir simplicity sake you end up just doing mydomain/services/customer1. It is semantics but I would love to put all of my services on a sub-domain and have browser based JavaScript be able to access it. It would make moving that logical sub domain off to an app server easier as it is a DNS entry as opposed to routing rules for the /services sub folder on the domain. For SaaS it would be a god send because for each client you could set up a virtual host that pointed services.clientdomain.com to the hosted app server and provide managed services for a client with just a simple DNS entry. As it sits now, the client has to set up configurations to forward /services to the managed services. For me and what I do, allowing JavaScript XHR calls within the second level domain would simplify some things. The problem is it assumes trust across a domain and that does not hold true for larger entities, for example say you have bigco.com and it has hr.bigco.com. You really don't want all of the enterprise to be able to access sensitive HR services so that is why you get the current model. I just wish it was configurable per domain.",1281332394
