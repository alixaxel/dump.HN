There have been huge strides made in artificial neural networks in the last decade. One example is the HyperNEAT algorithm [1], which uses an indirect encoding enabling it to evolve networks with millions of connections. There's an entire conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), which is considered one of the most prestigious publication venues in AI.<p>This article is complete garbage. Ant colony optimization has been around for decades. It's great for routing and similar tasks where you need to find the best path and be able to handle breakdowns in that path. However, there is no basis for making the leap that human brains function like ant colonies.<p>[1] Stanley et. al. A Hypercube-Based Encoding for Evolving Large-Scale Neural Networks.

1620880,comment,1620312,1620312,0,0,dasht,,,"Kurzweil snipes ""It is an argument from information theory, which Myers obviously does not understand.""  With some delight, I would like to explain how Kurzweil incorrectly uses information theory and arrives at a false conclusion.<p>In fairness, I'll also explain why Kurzweil's main thesis appears to be unassailably correct - albeit mainly because, in the end, he makes only quite weak and uncontroversial claims.<p>(For biological criticisms of Kurzweil, see ""knowtheory""'s comment.)<p>Kurzweil seeks to establish an upper bound on a quantity  he calls ""the amount of information in the brain prior to the brain’s interaction with its environment.""<p>He is not terribly precise about how that quantity is to be defined.  He does tell us that his upper bound will show that the ""design"" of the brain isn't very complicated and that it will not require ""trillions of lines of code to create a comparable system"".<p>To establish  his ""amount of information"" upper bound he looks at the number of ""bits"" in a complete human genome.  A human genome contains about three billion base pairs.  Each base pair position can have one of four possible values (e.g., contains two bits of information).  Thus he comes up 6 billion bits overall, around 715 Megabytes (he says 800), and he points out that genomes are far from random and asserts that the whole thing can be compressed down to, perhaps, 50 Megabytes.<p>Apparently we are to believe that the amount of ""code"" needed to build a system ""comparable"" to the brain can not possibly be ""trillions of lines"" because the genome does it in less than 50 megabytes.<p>A zygote, in other words is a machine.  It runs the code in the DNA.  The code tells how to build a brain.   Our simulator will be some kind of programmable system.  We'll supply it with code.  The code will tell it how to make or simulate a brain-like thing.   If a zygote does it with a mere 50MB of code, our machine will as well.<p>It is just there, in that last step, that Kurzweil invokes a fallacy.  In general, if you have two different kinds of machines, and you want to program each to compute the same result -- <i>upper bounds on the program size on machine tell you nothing about the the upper bounds on the other machine</i>.<p>That is why, for example, when Chaitin lectures about Omega he is always mumbling ""relative to some choice of turing machine"" (at least initially, until it is then understood to apply throughout the talk).<p>If all you know is that the zygote machine and our simulator machine are two machines - program size on the zygote tells you <i>nothing</i> about program size on the simulator.<p>There is, in other words, no abstract quantity that describes ""the complexity of the design of the brain"".   Information theory does not recognize any such concept.   There is no such thing as the irreducible complexity of a program other than relative to a particular machine.<p>The upper bound from the zygote could actually translate to our simulation machine <i>if</i> we agree that the simulator will operate on principles essentially the same as the zygote.  Alas, Kurzweil says the opposite: ""I did not present studying the genome as even part of the strategy for reverse-engineering the brain. [....] It is not a proposed strategy for accomplishing reverse-engineering [....]""<p>Kurzweil has to give up either the relevancy of the size of the genome, or his denial that we'll build a machine that operates on similar principles to a zygote (or on principles that can be proved computationally similar to a zygote).   Either way, he should not be looking down at Myers' understanding of information theory.<p>All of that said, if you strip out his hype his only substantial claims seem to be that we'll build hardware that can run neural network software very efficiently (perhaps in real time for brain-scale networks) and that we'll get clues about useful network topologies from looking at brains.<p>That, my friends, is a perfect message for a ""futurist"" to deliver to a dazzled audience because, well, to many of us it is what you call ""very old, somewhat boringly obvious news"".",1282323133
1620879,comment,1620594,1620716,0,0,rbranson,,,"It's just a marketing term for marketing to people who don't care about link protocols or multiplexing strategies. The problem was originally started when 1xRTT and EDGE were branded as 3G. This should have never happened, but that's what happens when marketing drives your business instead of engineering.<p>Honestly, even EVDO isn't really a true 3G protocol, as voice and data are completely separate protocols. UMTS phones don't drop to a voice-only technology to make a call, they use the data signaling, and IP connectivity isn't lost during phone calls. However, the fact that CDMA folks decided to go with a less ambitious, but easier to deploy megabit+ broadband technology meant they were able to beat the GSM networks to the punch. Worse is better.<p>That being said, WiMAX and LTE are legitimate 4G technologies. They both step up to using OFDMA instead of CDMA, which gives them a much higher theoretical bandwidth ceiling. Yes, HSPA+ networks have been pushing into WiMAX's bandwidth territory by adding MIMO and 64QAM modulation, but that's pretty much the ceiling for HSPA. The only future it has is in multi-carrier or multi-tower arrangements, which don't increase the spectral efficiency and are pointless in dense urban areas.",1282323114

The efficient market hypothesis and information theory tells us that using probabilistic models to extract a competitive advantage can only give good returns when your method is better than all of your competitors'. When two firms have similarly optimized tactics, they bet against each other and the margin of money than can be skimmed off their betting market will shrink to almost nothing. I don't mean that the profits will be split between the two. I mean the bidding war will push the price towards its optimal value where no money can be extracted.<p>In a competitive quant market, as all the firms perfect their mathematical models, they should all move asymptotically towards the best probabilistic model possible given the available information and eventually erase each other's gains.<p>The boom in computing technology of the past thirty years was an immense opportunity for mathematicians to make money by racing to perfect their models before others. However, as this industry matures it should eventually take only a few very good systems to extract a thin margin that will barely cover the cost of running the systems themselves.<p>Moving towards that point of efficiency is a capitalist and libertarian victory that people (at least those who believe in capitalism) should celebrate. The conclusion is a market so efficient that little money can be extracted by betting in it. That means money going to the real economy instead of the wall street casino and more value for everyone. The fact that the sector is shrinking indicates the free market is actually working.<p>I don't believe in the free market everywhere but I think when it actually works well and create value we should be glad, not lament the loss of the casino profits.<p>This allegory illustrates the efficient market hypothesis nicely: <a href=""http://agoraphilia.blogspot.com/2005/03/doing-lines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agoraphilia.blogspot.com/2005/03/doing-lines.html</a>",1282321690

The first is very difficult, and we have been working on it for a some time already.  Meyers' argument is that this is an astoundingly intensive job that will take an prohibitive amount of time.  The later relies on both the former, and an understanding of how the most complex biological structure that we are aware of is constructed.  Kurzweil suggests a (surprisingly low) bound on the complexity of this structure (which builds on complex proteins and should be seen as multiplicative of the former complexity).<p>But to say that Kurzweil is an optimist is to completely miss his perpetual argument.  As drug companies dump billions USD annually into both complex protein research and sequencing technologies, we advance the state of the art in both of these classes.  And while we have a long way to go, automation will get us there faster every year.  If Meyers were to show that Kurzweil's estimation of complexity was off by 1000-fold, Kurzweil would still win because we would reach the goal 12 years later than expected, and ""off by 12 years"" isn't as wrong as ""never"".",1282321033

And I fixed it, though this post will be very direct and (some will think) harsh.<p>But before I get to how I fixed it, I want to point out something very important. You are not that smart. Something like 90% of people think they are above average. Nearly half of them are wrong. You're not special. But even if you are, NO ONE is so <anything> that their behavior is overlooked. I once saw a guy in wheelchair get punched out because he was a dick. The dude that punched him was thanked afterwords by a lot of people.<p>Don't think that because you believe yourself smart, others will \n	a) even recognize that you're smart (You don't recognize that they are smart, after all, and they most likely think they are above average)\n	b) overlook your shortcomings because you believe you're smart.<p>I don't think you're smart. If you were, you would have realized that it is more desirable to be courteous rather than curt a long time before it started affecting your business.<p>Here is how I fixed my problem... I realized that just because something appears to be the most efficient way to do something (in my mind), doesn't mean that it is in the real world. This is the major premise needed in changing your behavior. It really is that simple. What I started to notice was that people have experience in a lot of things that I don't have experience in. Anyone will tell you that in order to accomplish something you need to stop thinking about stuff and actually do it. The value of that is learning how things happen in the real world rather than in your mind. People know things you don't know. People can conceive things you can't.<p>One other thing to consider: Most people don't have the chip on their shoulder that you seem to have (though correct me if I'm wrong). Most people aren't trying to convince you of how smart they are. So assume that because people don't use big words or try to sound impressive that they are of a dull mind.",1282320865

1620760,comment,1620055,1620055,0,0,malandrew,,,"As someone who looked into phpBB and managed a vBulletin installation for a company I worked at, I will say that yes there definitely is room. I was also one of the first couple hundred users and one of the early active participants in two forums that grew to thousands of users (head-fi.org, thewolfweb.com), so I've experienced first hand the primary problem of forum admins: growing the community and handling that growth<p>Here are the problems with the current options:<p>-- phpBB and vBulletin are self-hosted. The new platform needs to be SaaS.<p>-- Both platforms suffer from feature bloat, especially vBulletin. Forums aren't just products, they are tools for managing communities. Whatever product is designed to replace phpBB and vBulletin needs to begin with the basic premise that the forum participants are the users and not the forum administrator.<p>-- phpBB and vBulletin right out of the box come with too many useless features enabled. Most are features you don't need or that you don't need until the forum already has a large number of users. They complicate the forum in the early days and hinder growth. A forum is like a shark. If their isn't movement/activity it dies.<p>-- One key mistake almost all first time admins make is making too many forum ""rooms"" too early in the game. A forum should start with no more than maybe two to three ""rooms"". The software shouldn't prevent you from making more, but it should advise you against creating more rooms when the ""activity level per room"" is still low. The company who builds this software should actually discover the ideal amount of activity per room level to promote growth via aggregate A/B testing across all its clients forums.<p>-- In fact, this previous suggestion is the first in a long list of features that help ""prevent new forum administrators from shooting themselves in the foot"" kind of like a safety switch on a gun.<p>-- The new forum needs to be designed first and foremost to help its admins grow the user base and help stimulate user participation. This is key. Most new forum administrators don't have a clue on how to do this. I would say that the startup that tackles this problem would need to try a Mint Blog approach, which the blog educates the product's users on the topic of community management.<p>-- Were I the product manager for such a product, I would read Clay Shirky's ""A group is its own worst enemy"" several times before starting and regularly while designing the product. The idea in that essay is really important to understanding the state of forum software today and the problem you are trying to solve. Avatars are an example of a problem with forum software today. The avatars in both programs can be modified to be any size and can include animated gifs and whatnot. Basically, the avatar features are currently configuration over convention. On top of that the current defaults for avatars leads to a situation where avatars are so big that they create a lot of whitespace between responses that interrupt the feeling of the conversation threads. Allowing animated gifs results in distractions from the primary activity.<p>-- Invite features - Last time I checked, none of the current forum softwares are designed for viral/social growth.<p>-- Migration tools are necessary. You should make it easy for phpBB users and vBulletin users to migrate to your new forum platform.<p>-- Social network integration - The software should be designed from day one to have an API and to integrate with Facebook, Twitter, etc.<p>-- Constant email notifications by default to stimulate user participation just like Quora does. However this needs to be simpler to ""dial down"" as a user becomes more active as it eventually clogs up the email inbox of that user. Quora's control panel for this isn't very user friendly as it is very granular. A better approach would be to sort the types of notification emails by historical frequency from those that user has gotten the most of to those that the user has gotten few or none of. This makes the decision very easy for the user and promotes them to only turn off the notifications that are actually inconveniencing them.<p>-- I can cite at least one example that demonstrates that this is a product missing in the market: Zendesk. Zendesk comes with forum features, not because forum features are a necessary feature of a helpdesk, but because companies that need help desks typically need forums and there was no company that Zendesk could plug into via API for plug'n'play forum support. The forum software in Zendesk is adequate for most users' needs, but it doesn't scale well because it was always designed to be bolt on to the helpdesk itself.<p>-- I haven't used GetSatisfaction yet, but I would imagine that this is a shared issue with them as well.<p>-- Forums basically have two personas: hobbyists and shared-interest communities (i.e. head-fi.org, stevehoffman.tv, thewolfweb.com, church groups, etc.) and companies.<p>That all being said, I would say that an similar product that is also needed, especially inside companies, is QaaS. Quora as a Service.<p>A lot of companies want a Quora type solution first and foremost than a forum. I would say that Zendesk needs a product like a Quora-as-a-Service instead of a forum.<p>I'm currently working on my own startup right now, but if someone were to want to build this, I would be very happy to serve as an advisor/board member for a small stake of equity. This is a problem that I've given a LOT of thought to and that I would love to see someone solve.",1282320501
