They had the chance to really fix a lot of missteps but they made the (IMO) horrible mistake of using JavaScript as their ""assembly language"".  Regardless of what anyone thinks about JavaScript, not <i>everyone</i> is going to want to program with it.  Many of us will be programming in something else and compile to the base browser language.<p>What <i>should</i> have happened is that they just define a (high level) VM that we can all compile to.  The browsers could have certain languages they compile to this VM language their self (e.g. JavaScribt, VBScript, etc.) and the rest of us compile to a binary file and point to that in our HTML page (e.g. <code type=""vm"" location=""code/main.hvm""/>)",1282295019
