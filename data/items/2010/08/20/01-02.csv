It will be infinitely cheaper.<p>The Hollywood folks who learned their craft or made their TV pilot before hitting LA are always at a huge advantage over those who move with the dream first..",1282269560

The thing that changes between architecture is the instruction set, which is different, no matter what. That's actually the point of POSIX compliance: to define *nix-like systems in a way that is predictable.<p>Second, actually the more architectures you are compatible with, the more code is involved, and it tends to be more, not less, complicated. This is especially the case because all OSs have some assembly in them, and that assembly DOES change per your architecture.<p>Third, Minix is a ""working"" kernel. The main difference between Minix and BSD/Linux/whatever is that it is a microkernel, which is easily the best to learn on, on account of things like the permissions structure being MUCH simpler (arguably one of the most difficult things to grasp), but not the best in terms of (for example) security.",1282269169

But even for the people who consider the costs of being locked in, they can see that not being locked in provides little advantage.<p>If the entire market wasn't locked in to their contract, and could trivially take their phone number with them, they would have maximum provider mobility and the competition would get steep. If only a few people do this, it won't actually improve service or make the companies willing to adjust prices to keep these specific customers.<p>I'm not sure how the market came to this in North America and other select places, but I can see how it's going to be very hard for it to change.",1282268675

1619200,comment,1609207,1610511,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"can you give me an example of a connection that can be passively sniffed and <i>not</i> injected into? unless you have some wacky physical media which has no Tx, if you can see their traffic at the very least you send spoofed packets to the destination or source. if you're on the source's LAN you just spoof DNS and/or ARP for either the default gateway or the destination. if you're on the destination's LAN you can spoof the destination or do packet injection. if you're in between either LAN you can arguably do any damn thing you like, depending on network topology and routes. but i don't see a case where i could see the traffic and not do something to either downgrade the connection, hijack it or mitm it.<p>so they're risking their data on an uncertain possibility that a user might catch on that i've been downgrading their sessions and stealing everything? once you explain this to a user, do you think they'll really trust it?",1282267453

If they do, its hard for me to see how a lot of developers won't be doing Flash + iPhone versions of their apps first and only then native implementations.
