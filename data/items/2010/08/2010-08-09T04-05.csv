If the lifestyle that owning one's home affords is more important than the increased returns then perhaps you should buy. On the other hand if you are happy to rent for a decade or two you will likely end up richer.<p>I am currently of two minds, I love the idea of being able to do what I like to my own home. But at the same time real estate isn't necessarily the best investment, though where I am (Melbourne, Australia) we've had massive growth in housing prices (somewhere in the order of 20%+pa off the top of my head) though it is slowing down now.<p>One of my favourite bloggers Ramit Sethi has some strong opinions on the issue <a href=""http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/buying-a-house/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/buying-a-house/</a>",1281329969

I was wondering what people thought of this.  To me it seems a little disadvantageous as it means your lawyer's interests are now aligned with the other investors, instead of remaining independent.  As a founder, would you be second guessing advice given to you by your lawyer after the event, or would you trust that the advice they give continues to be the best for the company, even if 'best for the company' sometimes needs to be divergent from the best interests of the investors?",1281329793

1587045,comment,1586535,1586948,0,0,carbocation,,,"Let me preface by saying that I don't want to overstate what I think is really a rather modest difference of interpretation that you and I have.<p>I have read the paper, and much of their basic biology seems sound. They show convincingly that pancreatic ductal cancer cell proliferation does not differ between glucose and fructose at a variety of concentrations (figure 1).<p>They then compare pancreatic tumor to hepatic tumor to normal-ish tissues and show a series of metabolic differences when grown in glucose-containing vs fructose-containing media (figure 2). These changes include transketolase activity, ribose synthesis, and release of C13-labeled lactate into the media. Here, I have a bit of an issue. Nobody is claiming that our high-fructose diet causes us to have a glucose-free plasma, so it's totally non-physiologic to compare just glucose vs just fructose (which some of the panels appear to be doing in this figure, while others are comparing glucose vs fructose+glucose, which is a stronger comparison IMHO).<p>There are other figures; they are fine. I like their data. Where they lose me is with the claims that they make from their data. They show in figure 1 that there is no proliferative difference in Panc-1 cells between a glucose vs a fructose ""diet"" at all concentrations, but then based on data in figure 4 they claim that the TK-inhibitor oxythiamine reduces ""fructose-induced Panc-1 cell proliferation."" Well, which is it: does fructose induce Panc-1 cell proliferation, or does it not? Your answer will depend upon whether you like figure 1 better or figure 4. While these claims appear to be contradictory to me, it's also possible that I didn't read the paper carefully enough so please correct me if I missed something.<p>At any rate, just because this paper <i>cited</i> other work showing human studies (which it did), that certainly does not mean that this paper itself has policy implications. The human studies that it cited might have policy implications.<p>Especially given figure 1, which shows no difference in proliferation between cancer cells given fructose and those given glucose, I would have a hard time justifying policy claims with this paper.",1281329494

1587041,comment,1586757,1587009,0,0,dreeves,,,"I think I can make intuitive why the ""rent is forever gone"" argument is wrong.  Another way to state that argument is ""after I pay off the mortgage I own a house and live for free whereas if I'd rented the whole time then I'd own nothing and still have rent to pay"".<p>Quoting myself from the comments of <a href=""http://messymatters.com/buyrent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://messymatters.com/buyrent</a> ...<p>Imagine yourself 30 years from now with a house you fully own, with no more payments to make. Now imagine your alternate renting self who, instead of steadily paying down the principal on the mortgage, has built up hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity in some other investment. You still have rent to pay each month but that's also about how much you're collecting in interest on your investments. So the renter now lives for free just like the home-buyer.<p>Another way to say all this is that if you ignore price bubbles, taxes, personal preferences, and leverage then renting and buying are roughly financially equivalent. Not that you should ignore those things, just don't fall for the myths that it's a no-brainer decision.",1281329372
1587038,comment,1584988,1584988,0,0,eklitzke,,,"It seems like optical discs (CD/DVD/BluRay) are the right idea, they're just not made from stable enough materials. As far as I know, you could apply the same technology used to make optical discs to a more stable material like gold. Assuming that you could get the same storage density as a DVD (which seems reasonable, given that we have the technology/know-how to make 25GB single-layer BluRay discs), you'd need something like 500-600 disks (if you etched both sides). I'm a bit suspicious of my math here, but if my back of the envelope calculation is right a single disc made of gold would be something like 0.8 kg.<p>The nice thing about this solution is that there's a lot of existing knowledge about how to build and design optical media, how to build in parity checking, detect jitter when reading, etc. This could be relatively cheap to do in bulk also, if you found the right material (I just mentioned gold because I know it to be chemically stable, but there are probably better materials).",1281329306

Due to widespread belief in P ≠ NP, much of this focusing of research has already taken place.""<p>""Cryptography, for example, relies on certain problems being difficult.

However, the energy needed to travel back int time is the equivalent of a million Suns because that is the amount of energy needed to warp space enough so that time will reverse itself. And we found proof of this when we observed the black holes of two galaxies colliding. So, even if it were possible it would still not matter. Practically speaking, it would still not be possible to travel back in time.<p>My gut feeling is that if it were to turn out that P==NP that would not necessarily mean that all of a sudden we would be able to find the exact algorithms that make it easy to crack cryptography algorithms easily.",1281327116

Saddam Hussein had an inferior military to the US, but he could rule the country because he had no compunctions about doing things like gassing villages for opposing him. He was from the Sunni minority, disliked by the Shiite majority, but he had no problem putting down rebellions even after getting badly beaten by the US in '91.<p>So, as a rebel, your chances depend on the kind of leader you're fighting. If it's a Bush or a Louis XVII, you're in business. If it's a Saddam or someone like the men who put down the Jacquerie, not so much. In the limiting case, the powerful could simply round everybody they didn't like up and exterminate them, Nazi-style, if they chose to do so.",1281326731

I personally think this is best done in person.  When I need to communicate something important at work, I'll almost always ask a trusted coworker to help me read and edit my writing.  Without fail, they will see several things I missed.<p>I try to self-edit and, I can offer a suggestion from my own experience.  I strongly suggest using a pen on a paper copy.  This takes you out of the context in which you originally wrote the work-- your computer and keyboard.  You can step away from your desk and go somewhere with a different context.  A library, coffee shop, or outside under a tree are good places to rethink and rewrite.<p>And finally, I hope we'll see a revised version of your HTML5 paragraph-- you've clearly hit on an idea appealing to HN readers...",1281326480
