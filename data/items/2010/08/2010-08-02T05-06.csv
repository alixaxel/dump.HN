1566960,story,,,3,3,Kirvy,"Ask HN: What is the best way to implement a listener for web applications?",,"I am wondering what is the best way to implement a listener for a web application?
And how do large apps do this?<p>I can imagine a web application, e.g. php or ruby etc, that is linked to a typical database, e.g. mysql. 
The job queue is stored in the DB and another separate backend process polls this job queue - doing sql Selects
Upon detecting a new job, the backend then starts a resource intensive process, e.g. launch a virtual server, uploads file, start crunching data.<p>I guess polling is fine if it is not so urgent or the db is small.<p>But for faster response, is there a good way to implement a listener? 
It simply accepts the job from the web application, stores a copy in the DB and starts the resource intensive part. The whole idea is to skip the polling of the database.<p>Java has some useful classes but what about other web languages? 
Or am I approaching this in the wrong way? What are your experience in implementing this? Thanks",1280728438

I have a queue of projects that I would like to get to and when I have an interesting thought about them I document it in a project document but I never do development on them until I am done with my current personal project.

I'd assume that taxes are already included since that's part of what'd you'd consider when moving between areas, and is another area where you'd save by moving.<p>If we assume that taxes are included: Moving to Austin costs $20.9k in total salary. Total expenses would have to be $79,167 ($20,900 / 0.264) or less for the Valley to win out. If the hypothetical person saves more than $20,833 a year (after taxes since we're assuming those are part of the cost of living), having higher earnings is preferable to having a lower cost of living to increase the size of the savings. Many people don't save that much.<p>You also chose San Jose as the city for the comparison, when most people I know prefer to live in San Francisco, where the cost of living is even higher. Moving to Austin from San Francisco supposedly results in a 42.7% decrease in cost of living. You'd have to be saving $51,053 after taxes for moving to be a bad idea financially.",1280728138

It's cheaper than other cities and provinces to hire people, especially programmers. From everything I've read so far about the city, I think starting out is around 45k, then sr. positions is 60, and tops right out at around 70k for level IV guru coders. So, it's definitely not the Valley in terms of developer salaries.</i><p>The corollary is that the great programmers in Vancouver all move to the USA so that they can get paid effectively double what they would make in Vancouver. If you're good, it's also very easy on a TN-1. (I've worked with a couple dozen programmers from BC (Vancouver, Victoria) throughout my career)",1280725582

It's the same sentiment espoused by people who don't have time to design software properly, or test it, or do exception handling. The tool is an important part of solving problems, but having an elegant tool helps keep the tool itself from becoming a problem.
