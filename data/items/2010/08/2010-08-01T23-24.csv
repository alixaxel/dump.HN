In fact, I quite agree with you: structured formats are a good idea.<p>I, for one, would like to see --format options added to many of the standard Unix tools. I'd probably define --format= as a shortcut for specifying both --informat= and --outformat=. It would be great to have some sort of XPath or dotted object notation on the command line rather than hacking around with awk, sed, cut, etc.<p>Rather than:<p><pre><code>  ps -ef | awk -v p=$PPID 'p==$3{print $2}'

Do:<p><pre><code>  ps --format=xml | xquery ""/process[ppid=$PPID]/pid""

Or something like that. A bit more verbose, but far more understandable.<p>If I were to design the future, every tool would have metadata which describes which input and output formats it supports and prefers, so that most --format arguments would be optional:<p><pre><code>  ps | xquery ""/process[ppid=$PPID]/pid""

Have a look at FreeSwitch or Yate too. 2) If you don't feel like reading and understanding most of RFCs 3261, 4566 and some texts about T.38 renegotiation -- start looking for some experienced VoIP person to set you up with the basic gateway.

High appetite for risk and hunger for success/opportunity among young people. Lots of the best people are technical, and many come from middle class backgrounds.<p>2. Highly entrepreneurial society/culture.<p>3. Strong presence of many US Firms, VC and technological (intel, google etc..). Very tight communication lines between the Valley and Israel (many entrepreneurs and investors spend time in both places during the year).<p>4. Lots of highly skilled engineers and somewhat lower costs (by US standards).<p>5. A city that never sleeps and has wifi everywhere.<p>I mean this quite literally. You can go out at 4am to one of Tel Aviv's many cafe/restaurant/bars, order a shot of Jager, a wiener schnitzel with fries and a side salad, and an espresso to top it off, all while enjoying great wi-fi and being only minutes (walking on flat ground!) from the beach (where as opposed to SF, the water is actually warm most of the year).

1566325,comment,1565236,1565566,0,0,snprbob86,,,"""piping strings is dumb""<p>I used to believe this. I was simultaneously learning Bash and PowerShell. I <i>love</i> PowerShell....(when I am stuck with Windows), but I'd never trade in my Bash shell. Piping objects is cool, but in reality, what is it really? It's just a programming language with a terse syntax for manipulating iterators.<p>Let's compare...<p>Powershell:<p><pre><code>  Get-Process | where { $_.Handles -gt 200 } 
</code></pre>
C# 3:<p><pre><code>  Process.GetProcesses().Where(p => p.Handles > 200)
</code></pre>
Hmmm... what does piping objects even mean, really?<p>OK, so now why piping strings is interesting: forced serialization.<p>Every component of the transform can be debugged simply by deleting everything after that component. The new output goes to the screen or you can pipe it to a file. You get persistence for free. You can checkpoint your work and continue later. Imagine you are doing some very heavy duty processing that you only really need to do once. If you keep piping to a file along the way, you have backups and checkpoints.<p>What if you want to send the results to another server? You're going to have to serialize your objects. If your objects are arbitrarily complex graphs, how do you serialize them? It can get hairy, fast.<p>In summary: if you need to do arbitrary logic on arbitrary objects, use a programming language. If you need to transform some serialized data into some other serialized data: pipe strings.",1280704324
