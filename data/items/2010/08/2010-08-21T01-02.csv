And it's an attempt to legitimize the author's own fear of commitment.<p>> I’ve worked for a handful of companies over the course of the last 6 years. I started all of them with a fair amount of enthusiasm, but within 5 months of each I dipped into a depression. By 7 months the work was having a tangible effect on my mood and outlook, and by nine months, I’ve quit almost every job I’ve held.<p>Does the author <i>really</i> think that the next job will hold something different?  That somehow there's some magical workplace around the corner where reality never sets in and the inevitable drudgery of ""work"", creative or not, can be put off forever.  Pure fantasy.<p>""Ownership"" is missing the point.  If you believe you must define your creation or contribution in terms of some neatly measured production (like code or design) you are missing the point of your own existence.  If you think that there's some fixed body of work you have control and ownership over -- that you must defend and slave over -- you are missing the point.<p>Every second you exist at your job (and everywhere else for that matter) is an opportunity to create the world as you see it.  Every second is an opportunity to be creative, to express the person that you are in see that borne out in your work and with your coworkers.<p>The depression and negative outlook the author points to is a failure to <i>be</i>.  It's a shrinking away reality -- the reality of the opportunity and commitment that he faces each day he comes to work.  He does himself and everyone around him a great disservice by shrinking and turning away like this instead of waking up to what is in front of him.<p>I've been at my job for 8 years and there were many times I wanted to storm out in disgust or just not show up in the morning.  But then I realized that every job will be like this if I do quit, that I was bringing my own fear of being or committing with me wherever I go and <i>finding</i> perfect opportunities to manifest it.<p>I stood up and took responsibility for these fears and the negativity and said ""enough"".  I still occasionally find myself doing work that doesn't ""inspire"" my ""muse""... but it really is only a matter of perspective.  My muse can be inspired by change in attitude, but a positive conversation with a coworker, by seeing change manifest around me as it manifests <i>in</i> me.<p>I'm no longer defeated by this negativity. I no longer seem my work neatly delineated -- I no longer need to defend anything or pour enormous effort into some limited creative endeavor. The opportunities in front of me are always limitless.  Every second is created anew.",1282355823

That class of machines is a tiny subset of turing complete machines and that class of machines you refer to is irrelevant to the arguments to which you are responding.<p>When you argue that a simple (just a few rules of physics) emulator could, in principle, do the job -- quite right.

Some of what I've observed has been quite disgusting, and frustrating when the slackers get in your way.<p>You'll have to decide your own career path through this, weighing the situations you actually encounter.  I'd recommend using spare capacity to educate and train yourself further -- in things that interest you and appear to have a future, not necessarily their crufty, anti-pattern systems.  If your employer ends up actually using your talents, they win (and hopefully you do, too -- but beware).  If they don't, you're in a better position to move onto something better.<p>P.S.  While you're there, be open to learning about what other people do.  And when you encounter someone you really do respect, cultivate a good working relationship with them.  This shouldn't be forced nor manipulative; you'll actually enjoy working with them, and if you have genuine interest and some ability, they'll probably enjoy working with you as well.<p>You may have just found a mentor.<p>These days, it can be increasingly hard to make a (""Big Co."") career out of such -- the layoffs and inanities are just too great.  But maybe, and maybe it will lead to work that's genuinely interesting.  And when you're in a bind, you'll have some resources to reach out to and some people who have an interest in watching your back.<p>Countless times, I've been able to get ""the impossible"" done because I can pick up a phone or send an email to the effective (sometimes regardless of formal management) point of control.  They already know me and that I know my shit and don't BS.  Maybe also I've done them some favors, in the past.

Have them sit in on meetings and such, but no time on code, only customers.<p>+1 for that. Although I think having a full time support person might not be feasible for small startups, overall, I feel that customer support is grossly undervalued. Developers see tech support as beneath them. while management teams tend to view support as a cost overhead. Not only can great customer service lead to a extremely satisfied customer, it also helps close the feedback loop from actual customers back to development / product features.<p>and i say this based on my brief experience working in tech support.",1282353178

If an election is close enough for one vote to make a difference, you can bet that it will go to the courts.

But it's still possible, if you feel that it's net beneficial. I think another way to phrase your argument is ""By using my personal information to target ads and create more valuable search results, Google can subsidize some amazing products that I love. I would prefer to live in a reality in which such products exist, but can be paid for through some alternative means. Give me that reality, please.""

It is quite another thing to deliberately manufacture a net and then use that net to catch the last known passenger pigeon, and then publicly cook it and eat it, all the while knowing exactly what you are doing. That would be... <i>creepy</i>.<p>The other obvious point -- or you'd think it would be obvious -- is that the fact that (e.g.) our websurfing behavior is continuously monitored, collated, and sold to the highest bidder without our specific knowledge is ""inevitable"" only because Google and similar businesses work to keep it that way.
