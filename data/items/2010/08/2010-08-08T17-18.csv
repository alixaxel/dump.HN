They run their media through advanced heat/cold/light cycles to approximate how long the media will last.    There a number of vendors/technology providers out there that are working on this technology - see <a href=""http://www.millenniata.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.millenniata.com/</a>.    Electronics vendors do the same thing when creating 20 Year+ Lifetime components - Just heat it up to 85 degrees, then drop it down to -45.  Repeat over and over to advance the aging process.<p>I've heard that the LDS church / Vatican have both been interested in the archival media, and they have a pretty good long perspective, so might be worth checking with technologists in that realm.",1281290331

Chrome is fine for a single person, but for installing on a couple of hundred machines, the ""silent"" update is not silent to the network admin or anyone in a distance learning classroom.<p>I would really like vendors to allow updates from a local web server.

That's just appalling bad project management, which I think the U.K. regulator implied in its complaint (the ""experts"" knew of the control system architecture problems but management wasn't listening to them).<p>France has been technically quite successful in their nuclear power program (ignoring the experimental Superphénix) and was finishing construction of their last operating plant as late as the last month of 1999.

1585744,comment,1585085,1585462,0,0,zedshaw,,,"I agree, it is psychosomatic, although that's usually a term used by bad doctors to wave away real problems with people.  I think a better way to explain it is that your body is controlled by your brain, and if you control it wrong you can cause damage.  Same way if you punch or kick something wrong you can break your hand, if you spend 8+ hours a day typing with tension, poor technique, bad posture, and ignoring pain signals then you'll hurt your hands.<p>So yes, learning to control you body and how you use it is generally a good idea.  In general I think that's all Sarno's method does.  It just makes you focus on how the motions should be done in a more relaxed manner, rather than tense and harmful.<p>Combine that with the wrist exercises and you'll be even better off.",1281290254

1585731,comment,1585449,1585449,0,0,jordanmessina,,,"I've been an iPhone fanboy (I admit it) since the first generation.  I even waited in line for 13 hours for the iPhone 3g.  I've spent over $1000 on iPhones and accessories now (I've probably made most of it back considering I sell the old one when I get a new one).  I was completely dedicated to Apple and its magical phone.  But one day I got a little curious.  A friend of mine got the Droid and was in love with it.  I figured that I should at least give the Android platform a shot so as soon as Google announced the Nexus One for AT&T I had it ordered and in my hands the next day.  I must admit at first I was incredibly angry with the UI, it felt very clunky.  Also the touchscreen keyboard was awful and wasn't even close to the accuracy of the iPhone's keyboard.  After the first two days with the phone I was a little depressed that I had really just shelled out $500 for this junk.<p>I stuck with it though, and the Nexus One eventually grew on me.  What I started to realize was that it was a phone that wasn't built to be pretty or cute but rather useful.  For example, all alerts that came in I would know about via the trackball lighting up a particular color (I had red=text or missed call, green=email, blue=twitter @reply).  The status bar also made it very easy to see what was happening on my phone without ever having to actually unlock it.  Finally I didn't constantly have to unlock my phone, go to app X and see what just came in.  Because the marketplace is so lenient, I found everything I could ever want in regards to apps.  Wifi Hotspot creator,  LED Flashlight app, NES emulator, eBook readers, etc.  It's all there and the majority are free.  I never paid for one app on my Nexus One and it did so much more than any iPhone I ever owned.  Sure, the apps are never quite as polished but you get over it and start appreciating the functionality. On top of that, being allowed to put whatever I want on my phone by simply mounting the SD card is amazing.  Not having to deal with iTunes BS was so liberating.<p>Unfortunately, Jobs did an amazing job of hyping the iPhone4 and I switched back over.  I've never been more disappointed in my life.  I dropped maybe 2 calls the entire time I had the Nexus One.  Literally the first call I made on my new iPhone4 was dropped within a minute.  The antenna problem was real, and it almost ended my current relationship.  My girlfriend stopped talking to me on the phone and resorted to texts only.  Thanks Steve!  After being spoiled by the usefulness of Android the iPhone feels like such a toy.  You can only see one push notification at a time, if another notification comes in the last one is erased, I feel like they force me to be using the phone at all times or else I'm going to miss something.  I can't even switch back because I sold my Nexus One to my roommate, who rubs it in every chance he gets.<p>At least my free bumper came in yesterday.  Oh did I mention with the new bumper I can't use any standard 1/8"" headphone jack other than Apple's ear buds?  So every time I want to listen to music I have to take the bumper off...awesome.",1281289818

I'm going to try and take several weeks off later this year.<p>Maybe my writeup sounded worse than it is.

It can run in Canadian CANDU reactors, or be incorporated into the fuel mix in conventional light water reactors to get drastically improved fuel efficiency, or you can run pebble bed reactors entirely on thorium fuel if you're clever in your ball handling.

Pebble bed reactor designers have had 21 years to improve on that design, and they've not been idle. All real nuclear reactors have problems before you've had time to work out the bugs in the design.

1585700,comment,1584988,1585572,0,0,cstross,,,"The storage density of A-format mass market paperbacks containing dense UTF-8 text is roughly 4Mb/Kg. (A 400 page novel weighs around 250 grams and contains roughly 1Mb. Source: I went and weighed one of my novels, of known word count.) We can up the density somewhat by bzip2-compressing and then uuencoding (or similar); maybe 10Mb/kg is achievable.<p>Normal A-format paperbacks use acidic wood pulp for paper, but acid-free paper doesn't add a whole lot to the cost. So we get roughly 10Gb/ton, and the whole kaboodle comes in at roughly 500 tons. As the density of wood pulp is close to that of water, this approximates to a 10 x 10 x 5 metre lump. Quite a large time capsule, but not unmanagable :)<p>However. If we posit the availability of decent optical scanners in 50 years' time, there's no reason not to go denser.<p>We can print the data as a bitmap at 300dpi and be reasonably sure of retrieving it using a 2400dpi scanner. Let's approximate 300dpi to 254dpi, and call it 10 bits/mm. Printed on reasonable quality acid-free paper, we can get 100mbits/square metre, and that square metre will weigh around 80 grams (it's 80gsm paper -- same as your laser printer runs on). Call it 1.1 mb/gram. At this density, we can print the whole 5Tb (or 40tbits) on just 40 tons of paper, without compression; with compression, call it 20 tons. That's a 2.71 metre cube; just under 9' on an edge.<p>This assumes a monochrome bitmap. If we go to colour and use archival-quality inks we can probably -- conservatively -- retrieve one bit each of red/blue/green per dot, and it's probably not unreasonable to expect to get a whole byte out in place of each bit in our mono bitmap. So we can probably shrink our archive to roughly 2.5 tons of paper -- a pallet-load.",1281289040

I don't know if that's surgery, but you should at least talk to a specialist about your pain (not a general practitioner), and see what they say.  Also try to take a week or more off and not touch a keyboard or guitar.  If that helps then it may just be you need to change how you do things with your hands.",1281288939

Again, probably nothing you could have read about that would have warned you.<p>But I know of at least one person whose story I would love to read, if only he were around to write it, there might be a warning in there for some of us that really would make a difference.<p>> Perhaps the problem is the other way around: programming attracts such people, because it's a profession where you can be working alone.<p>Yes, I believe that is true.<p>>  If that is part of the attraction, no amount of offtopic warnings are going to help.<p>Not sure about that. As I wrote above, I have no evidence or idea of whether it would help, but <i>since</i> programming seems to attract such people <i>the</i> place to warn them would be in a place where those interested in their health would read about it, say a book about programmers and their health.<p>BTW, I'm upset at the way you're being downvoted in this thread, I'd prefer those that downvote to articulate their point of view instead of this silly piling on mob voting. The point you made was articulate, maybe unpopular but it definitely added to the discussion because it brought some interesting stuff to light.",1281287145

With a community such as this, I expected a lot more advice and personal stories. To be fair, I guess this did get posted early on a Sunday.<p>Many thanks to Zed for bringing it up the topic. I think it is always good for the programming community to hear different views on it. As we rely more and more on computers, mobile devices, etc., we're going to see these sorts of injuries more and more and I'm not sure the medical community knows how to deal with them yet.<p>I read HN sometimes and there are so many people doing full time jobs, then coding at home, then playing guitar on top of that! It is depressing to read because I'm lucky if I can make it through lunch without my arms hurting some days. I don't think people in my camp speak up enough (partly because we are trying to type as little as possible). I haven't played my guitar in years while I try to cope. I've been to some physical therapy, but found that it didn't improve things much short or long term. If you do visit a doctor (which you probably should), just be aware that they may suggest surgery. Personally, I don't think that is the answer to RSI in most cases.<p>I weight lift occasionally but I can't tell whether it is helping or hurting. I've always been curious about yoga, I just need a kick in the pants to get started. So, there's my personal story.<p>As far as advice, I don't have much since I haven't actually found something that works well for me. I read ""It's NOT Carpal Tunnel Syndrome"" which was an short, interesting read, but ultimately didn't help me with my particular problem. It does have good general advice, a section with stretching exercises and nerve glides, etc.",1281287065

They had a hard time finding other companies willing to invest in that area.<p>Airbus sells many airplanes. Boeing, too. It took a long time to go to fully digital control systems on airplanes.<p>I don't think any one wants a reactor to passively fail. That's a worst case scenario. If your reactor control system has to fall back to that, then it has no chance. The control system has a) to keep a reactor at all times in safe operation conditions and b) it has to work under failure conditions. If the core melts, then this is an economic loss of billions. The reactor in Finland will cost upwards of 6 billion Euros (last estimates I read were at 5.7 billion Euro). No one would want to have a core melting at such an expensive machine.<p>Read more here:<p><a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8138869.stm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8138869.stm</a><p><a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/27/nuclear-power-reactor-design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/27/nuclear-po...</a><p>This sounds even worse:<p><a href=""http://www.electricenergyonline.com/?page=show_news&id=138203"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.electricenergyonline.com/?page=show_news&id=1...</a>",1281287009

According to Wikiquote (<a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson</a>), the actual source is Stephen Leacock's <i>Literary Lapses</i>. (Side note: Leacock is the Canadian Mark Twain, though not nearly as sharp, which is about what you'd expect from a Canadian Mark Twain.) But <i>Literary Lapses</i> is in the public domain (<a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6340/6340.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6340/6340.txt</a>) and it's easy to verify that the quote isn't there either. So we have a misattribution squared.<p>I find this little domain of fake quotes fascinating. It's one area where web search is totally broken. Search any of these quotes (like the famous fake Gandhi one about ""First they ignore you"") and Google will happily serve you ream after ream of crappy web pages all repeating the same mistake. Or perhaps you'll get some pages saying a quote was Benjamin Franklin and others saying it was Einstein (they're both wrong). This is a weakness of web search: stuff that gets repeated often enough (as catchy misquotes certainly do - that's what they're optimized for) becomes the answer, drowning out the truth.<p>Presumably the antidote to social-proof-driven search is some kind of trust-based system. As far as quotes go, Wikiquote seems to be emerging as an authoritative place you can use to check up on things. But it's a bad sign that the above citation turned out wrong.",1281286952
