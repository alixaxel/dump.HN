The government loans you the money; interest is charged at CPI (so usually half that of commercial rates; my debt actually decreased at one point when Australia measured negative CPI growth!). To ensure their debt, it is compulsarily repaid as a percentage of taxable income - the higher your income, the higher the percentage goes (and yes, this does create situations where a payrise leads to a negative cash-in-hand outcome).<p>My debt topped out just over $20K. I graudated at the end of 2002, started paying it off in 2003 (ie, my first salary was high enough for the threshold) and it was paid off in mid-2009. I could have paid it off sooner, but the system means there are usually better uses for my disposable cash (mortgage, even cash deposit!). Still, it's good that it's gone.

1606290,comment,1606081,1606278,0,0,sidww2,,,"If P=NP, then conventional cryptography would be impossible. In particular you would have no public key cryptography so it would not be possible to transmit information securely over an unsecure channel without sharing a some sort of key beforehand. Think of what this will do to online transactions which rely on information like credit card numbers being transmitted securely. I'm sure other areas of the economy would be vastly affected too.<p>The one form of cryptography that would still be possible is quantum cryptography. But if I recall correctly, that requires that two parties already hold some shared secret before communicating.<p>Edit: In addition although it would be possible to detect if someone is eavesdropping over your communication, you still wouldn't have the privilege of being able to communicate securely regardless of whether your message is being recorded. 
This of course presumes that not only P=NP, but an efficient polynomial time algorithm exists for NP problems i.e. one which is say linear or quadratic or even cubic time.",1281916604

In this case, it would take China calling in its US loans to adversely affect the States' ability to maintain, and even extend their levels of debt.  For various reasons (the least of which is not that the US is the largest importer of goods from China) this isn't likely to happen.

The problem with looking at such a huge data set (this goes back to the late 19th century, is that the companies, industries and the world that we live in shifts significantly over time.  So the 'real' numbers are extremely important, but I'd have to do some more research to find out how his CPI calculations change from one era to another.  This is important because (to the best of my knowledge) there is nothing that says that the P/E ratio of a major industrial company in the 30s (thinking like Rockefeller, etc.) is equivalent to that of a big tech company now.  So as industries change, investment attitudes, etc. change, which will affect the overall P/E.<p>And as far as the market being expensive in relation to historics, again you have to compare apples with apples.

NP is the set of all problems that can be verified in time polynomial to the problem space with the use of a non-deterministic oracle.<p>Hold that thought.<p>If you have a list of <i>n</i> elements, you can search through the list and check if an element is in that list in <i>n^1</i> time.  If you have a list of <i>n</i> elements, you can check some property on a triplet of numbers in (at worst) <i>n^3</i> time, looping once for each member of the triplet.<p>I can check that there's a triplet that multiplies to 1337 mod 31337, in a set of <i>n</i> numbers, with three nested loops, and doing the modular multiplication in the inner loop, in <i>n^3</i> time.<p>Now!  What if there were a magic box you could use?  Whenever there are three such numbers in the set, it picks them out; whenever there are none, it just finds any three.  You can use that magic box, get the three numbers it picks, check it, and voila, you find your answer immediately, in <i>1</i> step instead of <i>n^3</i>.<p>So if a problem is in NP, you need a magic box if the problem is going to be solvable in <i>n^1</i>, <i>n^2</i>, <i>n^3</i> steps based on <i>n</i> inputs.  (They recently showed that Primality-Testing was in P; an <i>n</i> digit number can be factored in <i>n^12</i> steps. Large, but still polynomial, and better than the exponential-time <i>2^n</i>.)  If a problem is in P, you don't need the magic box to find it in polynomial time.<p>The magic box is the non-deterministic oracle.  The polynomial that expresses how hard the problem is, that's the polynomial of polynomial-time.<p>You know ""https""?  The security of ""s"" is based on how hard it is to factor two large prime numbers multiplied together, and we know it's in NP (just give me the two numbers, and I can check), but we don't think P=NP, ie we don't think there's an easy way to break all online commerce.

I have never been much into bookmarking, I have about 50 bookmarks now and the list is already unwieldy, even though it's categorised and synched. I just <i>never</i> look at them.<p>In Opera, you can see the titles, and you're lucky if you can make out the title of the item you're looking for. On historious, you just search for ""nginx ubuntu"" and it finds the document, even though the title may be ""So and so's blog | Webservers"".<p>Another thing is that, with historious, I don't have to think about where to put the bookmark. I just click the button and it's done, I can look at it later or not, it's always going to be there, even if I forget about it. I find myself searching historious first and Google later, as I usually find things that relate to what I want to do now which I had found interesting before but then forgot about.<p>Do give it a try, it's really changed the way I bookmark, and I love Opera to bits.<p>EDIT: Not to mention that I can create a custom search where typing ""hist <keywords>"" will immediately take me to the first result in my historified sites!",1281913888

It's the absolute worst of both worlds here; all the endemic poverty and crime of a big city, without any of the cultural and economic advantages.  So the Promenade was doubtlessly doomed to failure anyway.  Sad.  I actually lived on a third-floor walkup above it for a year or two.  I'm almost positive we were the only people who actually lived <i>on</i> the Promenade at the time.  I certainly never saw any others.  But there is a fine historical neighborhood two streets north and five east (the one where my current mansion is located) - populated by drunkards, the mentally ill, and drug dealers.

But if I look at other small Indiana towns I know, I can think of several with central squares that are still doing well (Paoli springs to mind, or Winchester), and New Castle's downtown died when the state closed down the street for construction for a year.  (Statewide mandates for width of state roads - they took out trees along the street, one of which my kindergarten class had collected money to pay for.  Oy.)<p>And certainly Richmond's overall economic decline started in the 30's and hasn't really gotten any better since then.<p>But my overall point is that pedestrian zones don't automatically turn into cafe-laden paradises, as much as we'd all like that to happen, and in America in particular that's less likely to happen than in Europe, largely (imho) due to our much lower density of population - itself due in part to automobile addiction.",1281913499

We also want to add Facebook integration, but its priority is a bit lower right now.<p>Thanks again, we add all ideas to our wishlist and are very happy to implement most of them (it just might take some time)!",1281913407
