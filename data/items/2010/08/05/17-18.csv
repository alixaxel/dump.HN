I have no illusions that this is equal to a business 15Mbps connection, which would be significantly more expensive. A T3 runs $3000 a month, best case. I pay $45 a month.<p>The original point that I disagreed with was the assertion that everyone should have a unmetered 6Mbps connection. Firstly, I don't want a 6Mbps connection -> I want a 15Mbps burst connection that best accommodates a normal user. Secondly that's enough bandwidth that if you filled it at Amazon's AWS, you'd be paying some $240 a month, and Amazon is at the crossroads of a number of primary connections, pretty much the cheapest place to possibly origin data.<p>Joe Homebody is many nodes down, through a lot of infrastructure and choke-points, and the cost for throughput is significantly higher: My neighbourhood has a large number of cable modem subscribers, and to aggregate the total sum up through each junction would lead to enormous bandwidth potential.<p>In the mobile space the situation is vastly uglier.

Good design takes a lot of time and iteration.<p>This is totally true, I paid $12,000 for a top of the line design on a site ~5 years ago, but that was after the business was already profitable and the better design/domain/branding would pay for itself.

The better design will help later, but it's the wrong place to put your resources if you have no users and no money.<p>Edit: Wordpress is totally decent and more versatile than people think.

There's something more fundamental to it than what can be encompassed by sweeping it under the carpet of ""style"".<p>Minimalism along with its cousins of Utilitarianism and Tufte-like information design all seek an elegance through elimination of components that are not vital to some singular goal of the philosophy.<p><pre><code>   Utilitarianism: capacity generation/utility\n   Tufte: information and interpretation\n   Minimalism: content and structure\n</code></pre>\nThe importance here is that given that our brains have limited capacity for attention, these philosophies help us the most so long as our goals reside near the goal of the designer. With a lot of other ""styles"" displayed in the article the goals were less practical and further from the end user with intent to express the glory of god or the power of a monarch. They are fantastically beautiful, but in those cases beauty is orthogonal to their function (meeting places and homes).<p>So that's the twist. You can make ornate, anti-minimal designs so long as their beauty lies at least somewhat alongside the purpose of the website. It's long been the maxim of web design that Users Spend Epsilon Seconds at Your Site and unless the purpose and content is clear like gunfire you're out of luck. But then you've got ""functional beauty"" such as that contained within detailed arts like typography. Each has a distinct utilitarian flair, but espouses a lot of craft via excessive care for detail.<p>So, some examples:<p><pre><code>   http://wufoo.com/\n   http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/royal/\n   http://blog.iso50.com/\n   http://joshuaink2006.johnoxton.co.uk/\n   (mbateman already mentioned Joshua Ink, but it's just a really good example)\n   </code></pre>\nAnd really, though it's not the same medium, the maximalist style of David Foster Wallace is from the exact same creche.<p>Of course, the catch is that with every added element, you take the risk of having your design run away from you. It's a viciously hard thing to do, I think, keeping beauty and purpose aligned.",1281028006

1578629,comment,1577992,1577992,0,0,aero142,,,"I think the goal of design is to make the aesthetics match the functionality.  In software, the greatest challenge is making something that at it's core is very complex, with all of the code that it takes to make it happen, and make it simple for the user.  The minimalist design represents this goal visually in the product.<p>But there are many other things where the experience or an emotional reaction is the goal, not usability.  For example, in music, if the focus of a song is a really great melody, then you want to simplify the surrounding parts so the listener isn't distracted from the melody.  This is similar to the modern design we are discussing.  In metal music, the goal is energy, so each part is very rapid and complex to give more energy to the song.  The drums keep driving, the guitar keeps moving, etc.  This is not minimalist because the goal is different.  Imagine a theme park.  The goal is fun and immersion.  So, the pathways in a theme park are not minimalist, they are winding and meandering and take you through the park where the journey is the goal.  All of these things exist to match the goal of the product.",1281027740
