This kind of thing is done via the system syscall interface. In fact, the more I think about it the more wrong he becomes. System call interfaces don't have any such thing as ""language dependence"" -- if you can't do a syscall in straight object code you're screwed no matter what language you're using. The syscall intrinsic in C and C++ is a nonstandard Linux defined relation between the OS syscall interface (per the OS designation for the ISA) and code being run.<p>Here's how you do a 2-arg mkdir:<p><pre><code>  push %rax
  push %rbx
  push %rcx
  movq $0x27, %rax
  movq $path, %rbx
  movq $mode, %rcx
  int $0x80

Here's how you do a 3-arg:<p><pre><code>  push %rax
  push %rbx
  push %rcx

  movq $0x128, %rax
  movq $dfd, %rbx
  movq $path, %rcx
  movq $mode, %rdx
  int $0x80

Edit: Hmm, maybe he was referring to overloading the <i>intrinsic</i>. That kind of makes sense, although there's a standard way to do that if necessary (first arg is number of args, just pop x off the stack after the call, see printf).",1282275082

IMO this term is best used to visualize how a model works (Amazon's long tail of books, Google's long tail of niche keywords and search results...), but when applying this concept strictly to a specific model to see if it's a long tail business it can yield biased conclusions. He cannot find one specific album on the store doesn't mean iTunes is a no ""long tail"" store. Or like when I cannot find a book on amazon it doesn't mean Amazon is a no long tail business. So rather trying to conclude if iTunes is a long tail business by looking for one specific item and see if it's available, a better and more precise way to do it is to look at the stats (quantity of ""niche"" songs sold compared to the more popular ones, revenue earned from those niche songs ...) to see if iTunes selling a large number of unique items in relatively small quantities",1282273301
