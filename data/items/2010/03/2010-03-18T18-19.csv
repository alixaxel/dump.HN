However, before accepting it, I would need to see what happens with negative <i>inertial</i> mass. Recall that, unlike electric charges, mass has a second role in physics beyond its interaction with one of the four primary forces. Specifically, it's the relation between force and acceleration. General relativity is founded on examining the connection between gravitational mass and inertial mass. If a body has negative gravitational mass, does that mean that it has negative inertial mass as well? Would this mean that if you apply a force on such a body, it accelerates in the opposite direction?<p>Also, regarding the astronomer that hung up: maybe he's gotten a lot of calls from pseudo-science cranks, and the author sounded like one on the phone.

The PC to my left has a video card with licensed H.264 that I paid for and free software that harnesses it, the Mac in front of me has both a video card with licensed H.264 and a licensed software decoder and I paid for both, the Windows 7 VM running in the Mac even has a licensed H.264 decoder that I paid for, the phone to my right has licensed H.264 that I paid for, heck the linux-based set-top box in the living room has hardware in it with licensed H.264 decoding and as I'm sure you can guess I'll point out that I paid for that license too. :)<p>""If H264 become standard, every browser will have to pay the license fee.""<p>Why? I just want Firefox to let me use the licenses I have already paid for.<p>All they have to do is defer to the appropriate operating system -level decoding support as many have suggested. That they are refusing to do so suggests to me that this has nothing to do with licensing fees and has everything to do with something else we've not quite uncovered yet.<p>At the end of the day, though, unless the Mozilla folks change their course I can easily see techies supporting family and/or business by saying ""just install Chrome"" the same way they used to (and to an extent still do, I suppose) say ""just install Firefox"" when their supported userbase complained about IE. The real risk now is that even if in the end Mozilla's issue is purely one of ideology it won't stop them from having become irrelevant in the process.",1268938621

1202129,comment,1201909,1201909,0,0,mdasen,,,"It's just a murky place.  To be honest, I think I believe Yelp.  SPAM is hard to figure out - especially when it's shill reviews - and it's easy to imagine an outsourced sales staff (working on commission) making all sorts of demands/promises to boost their next paycheck.<p>The issue is that Yelp has the incentive to be evil here.  That doesn't mean they are being evil, but incentive + coincidence == evidence?  It does to many people.<p>From what we've seen: Yelp is important to business since it's a site that creates a reputation for you.  Good reviews help you, bad ones hurt.  Yelp does some sort of SPAM protection to remove vindictive/shill reviews.  Yelp has the ability to manipulate all their data.  Yelp has the ability to ruin your reputation or create a good reputation for you through that manipulation.  Some businesses are complaining that Yelp <i>is</i> using that power and asking for money to keep a good reputation.<p>But there's hardly evidence.  There are no emails being posted showing someone asking for money and no recorded phone calls.  Reviews are disappearing and appearing, but we always change around data and sometimes algorithms are complex enough that you can immediately see why when you don't know the intent.  I mean, a week or so ago I saw an article posted 4 hours ago with 30 votes showing up lower than an article posted 6 hours ago with 24 votes.  OMG!  PG is manipulating HN for articles he likes!<p>Maybe.  But maybe it's more complicated than votes and time.  Maybe the age of each vote is used rather than the age of the article.  Maybe some of the votes were from SPAM accounts.  Maybe it uses karma to determine vote weight.  I could look up most of that in the source (SPAM stuff being absent there), but I just wanted to bring a relatable scenario into the mix.<p>If Yelp is manipulating reputation for profit, it borders on blackmail and they should be sued out of existence.  But I have yet to see anything conclusive that would indicate that.  To me, it looks like blundering mistakes - hiring a bad sales staff that lies; not making SPAM prevention and algorithmic changes transparent and understandable; etc.  Those are problems.  Being blundering and causing problems is something that one needs to address and it might be that Yelp is derelict in their duty (morally, legally, otherwise - I'll leave those bikeshed arguments for others).  And maybe part of it is hiring humans to read reviews and make determinations about shill level - we can all imagine sending out an email blast to 100 people asking them to rate us as 5-star on Yelp and then a deluge of reviews that were very short over a small period of time all being 5-star (and how that would look suspicious).<p>I think transparency is the key here.  Yelp needs to open the conversation up a bit and explain a bit better than ""algorithms do it"".  I know, once you tell people how SPAM prevention works, it ceases to be prevention.  Still, it's the reputation of businesses.<p>As for now, I'm willing to give Yelp the benefit of the doubt, but I hope the whole truth will come out in the future.",1268938141

We undoubtedly disagree on what things and in what ways, but I don't think the current systems and organizations are operating at their best, either. On most aspects of the larger problems am very undecided, but I have a particular bee in my bonnet over this issue because I strongly disagree with Mozilla's handling of the situation.<p><i>standards were a previously successful tool to avoid proprietary vendor lock-in</i><p>They still are. That's why we're talking about a single (albeit broad) format called ""h.264"", which dozens of vendors support and not dozens of different competing locked-in formats.<p><i>but they have since been captured by the very organisations they were meant to regulate</i><p>I'm not sure what you mean by this. To my knowledge, the primary participants in the relevant standards bodies have always been the same ones cross-licensing their IP. That would seem to make sense: You can't have interoperable standards if the parties won't share what they have, and the most reliable way of getting someone to share what they have is to give them something in return.<p><i>Making any royalty-free standard mandatory (e.g. Theora) is only an issue because of potential patent claims from trolls in general or MPEG-LA members specifically.</i><p>I disagree. Making <i>any</i> codec mandatory means mandating risk. In a standard, this means implementors agreeing to take on that risk--but the parties involved in HTML5 have not agreed to take on the risk of any codec. <i>Why</i> they choose not to is irrelevant from the viewpoint of authoring a standard. There is no sense in publishing a standard that is full of stuff which isn't actually standard. Trying to alter reality by altering the spec would not work regardless of patents -- it would just make otherwise compliant parties non-compliant, to no end but smug satisfaction.<p>(It's worth noting here that h.264 was never mandated by the spec. The parties that implement it have done so for their own reasons, without being mandated.)<p><i>Without that patent threat there is no substantive reason to not implement Theora (or any potential VP8 derived codec).</i><p>The same is true of h.264, with the essential difference that licensing allows the risk to be managed, even without patent reform. As in, today. If we had to hold up all progress until the messy problems of international IP law had been solved, h.264 would be patent-free by the time we were finished.<p>And this on top of the fact that there is very little technical or economic reason <i>to</i> implement Theora. It's just not that useful.<p><i>the groups who have refused to implement Theora have done so primarily because of influence brought to bear on them by MPEG-LA</i><p>On what evidence do you make this claim?",1268937065

1) You develop a deeper appreciation for the ""simple"" stuff.
It's like this: you turn a wheel around slowly to study its intricacies, appreciate its design, see the structure of the spokes, etc. Now, when that wheel is in high motion, you can thoroughly appreciate the motion and the wheel. So, yes, a CS/engg degree may help you in this respect.<p>2) Pair/peer programming. You can learn so much from observing a good coder at work. Even more importantly, get a big picture idea of data structures and algorithms even if you don't understand it completely. Ask your CS friends to explain it to you. Now, explain what you learned to your non-CS friends. Teaching someone else forces you to get to the core of a problem/question.<p>3) Funny thing about code prettiness. Share your code on Git Hub and ask your friends for comments. Or pick a simple open source project and write your own code. Then, compare it with the source and see how you could have refactored it.<p>4) Repeat 1-3.<p>Well, it seems as if you are comfortable enough with yourself to admit your true capacity. So, go out there and find yourself a technical co-founder someone smarter than you. Chances are very likely that you don't necessarily need to know how to write a kernel, nor does your co-founder. The only thing that matters is that you are smart enough to figure things out and aren't afraid of reaching out to people who do AND can point you in the right direction.<p>Well, if nothing works from above, sometimes it's just better to stick with something you are working on and iterate.

I put forth that the form of the invention <i>after</i> it has gone through that process of building a real protype will be qualitatively different than the theoretical one the NPE designed.  So, the patent for the theoretical device will be next to worthless to society because it doesn't represent the form of something that will actually work.  Yet, under current patent law the NPE would be able to extort money from the company that did build the actual working form.<p>One problem IS that NPEs should not be allowed.  There should be several requirements for a patent:  1.  You must produce an actual, working prototype.  2.  If some period of time (say, 2 years) elapses during which you're not physically producing copies of the device for sale, you should lose the patent right and it becomes public domain.  Trademarks have to be defended to be kept; patents should have to be backed with <i>production</i> to be kept.  3. Patents should be non-transferable.  Companies should not be allowed to own patents, only inventors; the inventor can give license to a company to make his invention.",1268935838

1202002,comment,1201761,1201868,0,0,barrkel,,,"Here's my explanation of Monads, assuming one knows the basics of modern imperative programming, and knows what a first-class function is (even thinking of it as a function pointer will do, if you don't).<p>Monads are essentially a design pattern, an abstraction, for dealing with items of some arbitrary type (call it ""a"") in some way.<p>Instead of working with values of type ""a"" directly, you work at one step removed. You hand the value of type ""a"" off to the monad, and it hands you back an opaque box (of type ""M a"") which logically contains your value. Now, instead of operating on the value directly, you instead hand the box a function that's supposed to apply to the contents of the box, and in return you're given back a new box with the function applied to the contents of the old box. That's basically it.<p>The interesting bit is that the monad - the box - sits between the function you're trying to apply, and the value it's supposed to apply to. That gives it the opportunity to do clever things. For example, the Maybe monad can keep track of whether the box is empty or not, and only apply the function you pass in if there's actually a value there. The List monad lets you apply operations to multiple values as if it were only one value (i.e. it's like an implied map). The IO monad takes in your function that's supposed to be applied to (e.g.) whatever was read from input, and hands you back a box that appears to contain the results of that operation. The catch is that the box is opaque - you can never look inside it - so there's no way for you to tell, from the outside, whether or not there were any side-effects. The IO monad can be looked at in another way: you can think of it as queuing up all the actions to perform on I/O, but actually building up an imperative program inside the box, which only ever gets opened up and evaluated after your program has finished its whole pure computation. (This is just a mental model for IO in the context of pure functional programming, with no side-effects.)<p>Putting a value into the box is the unit operator, also called return in Haskell. Passing in a function to the box and getting a new box in return is the bind operator, spelled >>= in Haskell, but simplified by do notation.",1268935345
