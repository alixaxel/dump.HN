With it being so easy to send out hundreds of ""e-vites"", as opposed to the effort/expense involved in sending nicely printed or handwritten invitations by mail, I can't be sure that the invitation was actually intended specifically for me, with any modicum of thought involved, as opposed to just being an email blasted out to someone's entire address book. So I tend to only respond to the ones where either I actually am going, or I have some reason to believe the sender wanted me in particular to come or give regrets if I can't (e.g., if it's a close friend, or I know I'm part of a smallish group of invitees).<p>I do agree that not RSVPing <i>and still showing up</i> is a breach of etiquette; a non-response ought to be treated as an implicit no, imo. But to help that along, it does pay to make sure to explicitly request an RSVP fairly prominently. Among the flurry of emails I get, an invitation that requires an RSVP, versus an open invitation that I can just show up to or not, aren't always that easy to distinguish (for example, I don't have to RSVP to show up to visiting speakers that my university sends me email ""invites"" to).",1268642494

1192426,comment,1192360,1192360,0,0,tsally,,,"I was having a discussion with my friend today on related topics and I couldn't figure out the answer to this question:  where does the demand for talent in the finance industry come from?  On a basic level, banks exist to facilitate loans.  Someone with money gives it to the bank.  The bank loans it out to someone who pays it back plus interest over a period of time.  At the end, the bank and the original investor get some return on his/her money.  The hardest part about this chain on events is picking people who wont default on their loans.<p>But clearly the demand for talent in banking is much higher than that.  These people get paid extraordinary amounts of money.  So where is that demand coming from?  What service is being provided by banks that warrants the compensation?",1268641434

I prefer trains whenever reasonable because airports are simply nasty and annoying. I spend much more time at airports than I do flying. The security theatre is frustrating and volume and type of stuff one may transport is very limited. The economical argument is volume. Once you have a train line running, it is extremely cheap to transport large volumes of people and goods. Having a train connection would make a lot of travel possible that currently just does not happen due to prices or volume/weight limits. Also, a two day train trip is much less stressing physically than a one day flight. On a train, you can reasonably walk around, interact with people.
