Another way of describing it is the US receives actual money, which can be spent now, in exchange for only giving ""promises"" back, which may or may not actually have to be replaced with money in the future.<p>So yeah. While debt for individuals, or in smaller amounts is often ""not good"", debt starts to get weird and quantum-meta-paradoxical when it is between countries and involves huge sums. Also, ultimately, China can't make the US ""repay"" them or cough up cash. They could threaten to start a war, but a war between the China and US would arguably be just as bad for them as for US. Potentially worse for them.<p>It's complex, so I won't claim this is a black-or-white truth. But these are some of the factors involved, I think.",1269575204

1220153,comment,1219952,1219952,0,0,johnfn,,,"Two thoughts about this.<p>First, this gives facebook a huge database of the Internet. Essentially, if they wanted to release a stumbleupon equivalent, they could. Or if they wanted to target ads even closer to your interests, they could. This makes me feel (more) nervous about facebook.<p>Second, I've always been really interested in finding the best webpages on the Internet. Unfortunately, this is another one of those metrics that conflates popularity with quality. If we assume that X% will press the like button (where X is different for every website), and Y people visit the site, then we have a total number of likes = X*Y/100. But since X only goes from 1-100, it's pretty easy to see that popularity has a much larger affect on how many likes a site will get than how good it actually is.<p>Essentially, the number of likes is a meaningless statistic (except to measure popularity).",1269573275

Git's toolkit took about ten minutes to get used to, but then I suddenly realized that it made <i>far</i> more sense than SVN. git add, git status, git commit -a. All repos are equal. Everything is small, and everything is fast. Really fast.<p>There's rarely a need for git rm or git mv, since they're implicit. Waaay better than SVN, where I could never remember if I had to move it by hand first or afterwards, and half the time committed multiple copies of a file I meant to rename.<p>The empty directory thing has never been a problem for me; my software creates directories as needed. You can always drop a .file in the dir if you really need it.<p>Branches work great. They're just pointers! Plus you can revert merges, and it just <i>works</i>.<p>I never rebuild the history, but I guess if I was working in a large team with complex patchsets I might. Our team of six seems to get along just great with a central free-for-all repo.<p>Gitk is ugly. No two ways about that. :D",1269572603
