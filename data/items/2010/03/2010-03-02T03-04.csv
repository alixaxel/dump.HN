1160562,comment,1159683,1159866,0,0,stealthyc2010,,,"> I have a few journalist friends (as no doubt do you guys) and pointed a couple of them at this.<p>Thanks for doing that. I hope you'll point them at this comment too.<p>> [...] you'll probably find that a lot of your target market  quite bitter and resentful that they've been reduced to this. [...] they just want someone who'll give them a honest day's pay on a stable basis to get on with what they love doing, writing well-crafted stories.<p>Yes. We talked to a ton of journalists before we got to this. Everyone had the same story (many bitter) that you outlined above. We are honestly not trying to screw anyone. We should have outlined the financials a bit better: 80% of all revenue goes to the content producers. This is a platform for journalists to earn a good living, not for us to exploit anyone.<p>We want to provide a good living to people who write good content.<p>> Not all journalists will necessarily be entrepreneurial sorts, and the ones that are will often be able to seek out geeky friends to help them out online anyway.<p>We're trying to add value for both kinds, not just the ones who can't work the internet.<p>> With that in mind, there are a lot of sites out there on the internet with too-good-to-be-true sounding propositions on how they can help you make money online, build an audience etc. Once burned twice shy with these sorts of operations - often it turns out they pay you peanuts to be a cog in the wheel of a SEO-spam factory which profits them more than anyone else.<p>We have come across a number of these - we dont want to name names - but we are the opposite. I guess the fact that we were trying to keep on the down-low made it seem sinister. Just the opposite - we are open sourcers and believe in transparency. It will be trivial to calculate how much revenue your content has brought it: multiply by 1.25.<p>> Even with the best intentions just to offer people better tools on a win-win basis, it's hard to avoid coming across as scammy or profiteering when dealing with people who're feeling unemployed and vulnerable career-wise.<p>Right, this is an important point. We'll work hard to make it seem like we aren't scammy at all (cause we aren't!).<p>> So, I guess what I'm saying is you might really want to make sure you stand out from the crowd of ""join our SEO-spam-factory""<p>Noted. We had hoped the YC brand would make us stand out from spammy-bastards, but I guess not.<p>> [...] if the tools being offered lock you inextricably into some company's hosted ecosystem, I'd be a bit skeptical
[...]<p>We are wary of this. We will build tools to automatically move off our platform. It wont be our first priority of course, but if people want to move off we will help them do it.<p>> Anyway hope that didn't come across too negative, I'm glad more people are taking on what's such a tricky problem!<p>Positive people won't tell you that you may be coming across as a spammy bastard :) Thanks!",1267502296

In other words, whenever you crawl a link, you feed the link to the developer's script which does whatever it wants with it. I've had plenty of ideas that would involve a web crawler, but I just don't have the time to customize an open source crawler. There are too many complications like not falling into infinite loops (such as a calendar type pages).",1267502195

As it turns out, about 40% of this is basically welfare from the rest of the world, but that is neither here nor there for the current argument. So, anyway, each Haitian is producing somewhere between $700 and $1,300 of value each year ... and likely eating 90% of that as food.

1160525,comment,1154611,1157737,0,0,techiferous,,,"Good point.  Intelligence may not be a primary factor in the choosing.  One reason why some people are vegetarians and others not is exposure to the information about factory farming.  So if you don't know what's going on with animals, you could be highly intelligent and not be a vegetarian.  Another reason is you could be intelligent and narcissistic.  You may know about animal suffering, but not care.<p>The reason I believe there could be a link (maybe a very small correlation; nothing big) is my own ""anecdotal"" observations.  I've seen how a lack of intelligence can keep people from becoming a vegetarian.  Often people don't address the issues in a well-reasoned, objective manner but react based on their emotions/desires (""but I just couldn't give up cheese!"") or more often, simply avoiding the topic altogether.<p>I have not once, ever, come across a sound, cogent reason for eating meat (barring edge cases--just talking about the typical case).  But I've come across many different sound arguments for avoiding eating meat.  The overwhelming truth and well-thought out arguments of vegetarians impresses me.<p>For more context, I wasn't always vegetarian.  I was raised with meat at every meal and I would complain if I didn't have meat.  It was ultimately the cogency of the argument for vegetarianism that converted me.  I would convert back if I came across an argument for eating meat.<p>So after years of hearing poor arguments from the meat-eating side and sound arguments from the vegetarian side, it makes it believable when someone suggests there might be a link between vegetarianism and intelligence.<p>(I'm actually quite impressed that this Hacker News discussion hasn't degenerated.  In my experience online discussions about vegetarianism often degenerate into childish snark.  Thanks for keeping it real.)",1267500745

""Traffic"" harkens to the Bad Old Days of selling eyeballs to visitors, but if you're selling software eyeballs don't make you money.  You can goose ""traffic"" by appealing to the desires of StumbleUpon visitors (7.5k in a month: that and $4 will buy you a cup of coffee), but that can lead you to pessimizing for the business.<p>For example, and I'm about to say something heretical: forcing people to give email addresses prior to use seems to be a bit of a win for me.  It filters out anyone who is insufficiently skilled with computers to type an email address, for one thing, and for another the opt-in permission many of my users give is empirically worth its weight in gold.<p>I also have anonymous ""guest"" signups.  They convert about as well as trial users from mainland China <i>and</i> they cause a disproportionate amount of my support headaches.

This is a subject he is very, very passionate about because he spent way, way too much of his time and energy on pathological customers at the bottom of the SEO market, which is filled with scum and villainy.<p>""Charge more money, get better customers"" is a repeatable effect I've seen in my business and in several other ones.  My anecdotal sense is that every time Aaron ups the price, the quality of his forums go up.  I'm not saying that to shill, its just that when folks got in for $50 we got a lot of ""I have a website about Nintendos how do I make $1 on AdSense A DAY?!?"" and now that it costs $300 a month it is mostly people with real businesses who have existing SEO strategies and want feedback on improving them.  This makes me happy because it means I spend less time writing newbie advice and more time writing intellectually interesting ideas for e.g. how to execute linkbait better.<p>I think this is probably applicable to most of the SAAS businesses here.  Every time I see stats published from a SAAS business -- every single time -- the most revenue comes from the most expensive plan.  That and the pathological customer bit suggest that one could probably just ignore the $9 / month crowd and concentrate on more well-heeled customers.  Some people will scream bloody murder: invite them to use your $9 / month competitors.  Now they're somebody else's problem.",1267499216
