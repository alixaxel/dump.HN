I get infuriated sometimes how hard it is to search for a specific term. I have to use all kinds of + and - signs in my search terms to get anything near a meaningful result and it is not straightforward at all to simply go to an English version of a Google site because Google insists that I must be Dutch and therefore only want localized information.<p>Of course they did not get worse because of the personalizing (though the location-based stuff absolutely has to go away - we have browser language strings for that, don't try to guess what I want if I have a way to tell you what I want), but I do think they did pretty well before they did all that, so I see no reason why DuckDuckGo can't as well and wish them the best.",1268729996

All of my clients are not from Elance/Rent-a-coder/etc. Most of them however sent me an email from a ""local"" community site of web developers.<p>I always tell me clients that I have a 8/9-hour day job. I update the client every few days through email. Sometimes I work at night and sometimes I don't. When I work at night, I spend around 4 hours maximum -- average is 2 hours. On the weekends, 6 hours. I was still able to go out with friends and have fun. Mostly TV time and video games were cut-off - except for a brief 2 month re-play of Diablo II :P<p>I do mainly web development / web design.<p>Right now, I am trying out a new career that doesn't involve the internet. But still though, on my free time I work on pet projects I have listed down a few years back.",1268729933

1195306,comment,1194757,1194757,0,0,apsurd,,,"In my mind, HN is intentionally built to be minimally social. It is also what makes this site consistently have higher quality content. This may be of some debate but I feel HN is slanted toward <i>doers</i>. HN is almost featureless but one of those features is ""noprocrast"" - a function that actually promotes NOT coming to the website. If pg wanted to slant toward information consumers he'd add rss and retweeting and auto post-to-my-thousand-social-media-services features. So it is in this way that any type of social media extravaganza would actually be counterproductive.<p>HN is wonderful the way it is imo and the fact that it actually takes effort to find things or get into to touch with other members is the reason why it is wonderful. Take your example. If you felt the need to add your opinion the the conversation or felt that a comment was so incredibly beneficial, take some effort to reach out to that individual via an email or his company blog, etc.",1268729430

I would do the school thing to get the grades but spend as much time as possible outside of school.<p>Work on projects which will get people to take notice of what you are doing.  Participate in open source projects.  Perhaps start a business you can do on the side.<p>One of the things I found most interesting about my school were the projects that the schools researchers were working on which they could spin off as businesses.  These researchers were willing to take students as interns and even eventual hires.<p>Many (most?) of this work is an interesting mix of tech and medical / natural / whatever sciences which went beyond my imagination.  You might look for these sorts of opportunities at your prospective schools and start networking early.

Yes, there's plenty of questionable offshore code factories on there, but occasionally I find some really talented, professional folks, and they rise to the top (and get booked) really quick.<p>If you take as many tests as you can and completely fill out your profile, it makes a world of difference in selling yourself. I'd also suggest pricing yourself a bit higher if you think you're good. I imagine you shouldn't have any problems making $300+/mo off it",1268727134
1195280,comment,1195229,1195229,0,0,gexla,,,"Sure, but it depends on what you are applying for.  The more niche, the less competition and higher pay.  Some people just aren't willing to pay much for anything, so avoid them.<p>The best way to land jobs is to be the best person for the job.  Some buyers are able to cut through the fluff and identify the quality.  These buyers aren't nearly as concerned about price.<p>The way to be the best man for the job is to have a strong profile in the area you are bidding for. For example, if you are bidding for Drupal jobs, then be a contributor and /or have some useful add-ons under your belt.  Express confidence that you are the right person in your proposal and back that up with your credentials.<p>Speaking of building add-ons, while using this method to build up your profile, consider selling something if it gets a lot of interest.  You might make as much from selling add-ons as your target for extra monthly income.<p>In certain jobs you may even outline how you would do the job and what tools you would use.  This works great for smaller jobs because it educates buyer on what you will be doing before you even get started.  This really sets yourself apart from the generic proposals.<p>There are certain jobs which might look decent but you can clearly see the buyer is going for cheap in an area that lower cost providers should be able to easily handle.  If you get this vibe and your rate needs to be higher then move on.  Usually these types have a low hourly rate posted.<p>Look for jobs with a fixed cost.  You can often beat your target hourly rate if you find something you can do fast.<p>Done right, all that competition won't matter much.",1268727123

I wonder why in western countries people often say that waking up makes the child cranky (I totally understand it can make parents cranky). Did you have to get up early to bring the child to daycare so that they did not get enough sleep? Did you not sleep in the same room as your child, so you had to get up and walk there, so that they were disturbed before you were there?
