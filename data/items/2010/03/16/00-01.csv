Getting all of those pages crawled must generate a massive number of continuations to persist.<p>I know that this is one of the reasons that vote-links look the way they do.<p>If that's not the reason, then my #2 guess is that getting the whole site crawled is moving too many comments into the cache.

By productivity, the ""subordinate"" is not necessarily subordinate at all. The working relationship may  be much more than of peers, where the pair of them manage to both get things done, and keep people informed of what is going on. It might even be that the subordinate in the traditional sense is anything but in the tangible sense.<p>What sucks is that the traditional organizational arrangement has a very difficult time representing this. It mandates a strict hierarchical arrangement of staff, even if the staff themselves does not view themselves as hierarchical.<p>Because, in this arrangement, one person is usually granted the ability to terminate the employment of the other, there is <i>necessarily</i> an adversarial component to their relationship. Even if they work as peers, one has to report to a chain-of-command about the other.<p>For people and teams who don't need this sort of arrangement, having it imposed absolutely sucks. But, because it so entrenched in corporate tradition, it emerges anyway.<p>I rail against it as well.<p>There are people who don't need it, but those who don't need or want this arrangement get it anyway, regardless of the detriment it causes. I get the sense this happens simply because of the perspective that it must necessarily happen, because people have all these preconceived notions about management and subordination that they have a hard time letting go.<p>I think we'd lose the adversarial perspective if we lost the notions, and that would be a good thing.",1268699867

I've never seen a bookplate on a non-library book. To me, the idea of marking a specific instance of a book as one's own sounds alien. The only marks I make on my own books are notes or marking important passages.<p>I doubt it surprises anyone when I say I don't understand what this guy is complaining about. He can still buy paper books and give them bookplates. Many people prefer paper to e-books, so it's unlikely that paper books will disappear any time soon.<p>He ends with, ""This books belongs to . . . no one."" I completely disagree. Digital media costs almost nothing to reproduce. Books are cheaper than ever before. Literacy is higher than ever before. There is more CC-licensed media than ever before.
