1196797,comment,1196297,1196592,0,0,bad_user,,,"I think you're mostly talking about the hardware compatibility, since the actual OS / default software coming with it, while OK, personally I've had lots of problems with it (including Samba sharing not working, wireless connectivity at a conference not working, Finder crashing on me, etc...) Not to mention that most multi-platform software packages are better supported on Windows (Flash, Photoshop).<p>Related to hardware problems, when coming from Linux, it may be quite true, but in case you're thinking about a future Linux-powered device, search for the ones that are compatible (for example Dell or Acer laptops are usually fine).<p>On both Windows / Linux ... it's much harder to do QA on hardware compatibility when your list of supported devices has all the devices ever created. Try installing OS X on top of an AMD processor.<p>The people I know that switched to Macs have done it because ...<p><pre><code>  * they want Unix and their company only allows Windows / OS X\n  * they love Linux but need commercial software (Photoshop)\n  * they want Unix, but hate Linux's problems\n  * they want to look cool\n</code></pre>\nThat last point shouldn't be underestimated. Almost every Hollywood movie that features a man/woman in front of a computer, it's from Apple.<p>I've never seen a single normal person that voluntarily choses OS X over Windows / Apple over Dell ... because of technical superiority or because of the lack of viruses (if they do, they saw it in an ad).<p>Normal users don't think about such things because normal users blame themselves when the shit hits the fan and they always have a friend that can fix it (over and over and over again). And when they buy from Apple, guess who are they're gonna call when their old webcam isn't supported or when some piece of software they've got from work isn't working :)",1268773163
