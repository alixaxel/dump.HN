Firstly, IE users are less likely to care enough to upgrade a browser, for the same reason they didn't care enough to look for a better one. Namely, it doesn't really matter to them and they're unaware of why it should. Secondly, Microsoft is a lot less pushy about software updates than other browser vendors.<p>IE7 came out 4 years ago (and then IE8 two years later), but despite what an enormous improvement it was to IE6, we're only now seeing IE6 finally start to fade away. IE6 usage didn't drop below half of all IE usage until around June 2009. By comparison, Firefox 3 had more than double the usage of FF2 within 3 months of its debut.

The purpose of the HTML specification is to standardize and formalize how pages are structure, not predict every corner case.<p>For example, many sites are now embedding videos, which is a heavyweight activity. So HTML is being extended to be able to say ""This is an embedded video"" so that browsers can handle the nitty-gritty details, not people who make webpages.<p>Disclaimers are not heavyweight. They're usually a single sentence. That's what I mean by ""too lightweight."" It's too specific because very few people have to put up disclaimers - yes, few people have to, say, embed video, but embedding video has more performance implications on the browser, and many people will view such pages. It's not worth the corner case for something as small and specific as a disclaimer. Lastly, the trend in HTML standardization seems to be ""formalize existing practices."" I don't think there's an existing practice for disclaimers beyond just putting a sentence or two at the beginning or the end.<p>Finally, I think that re-postings of a review could cause legal trouble beyond the original posting is a weak argument. And in the case of a re-posting, I don't see how adding a semantically tagged disclaimer would help - the HTML probably wouldn't be copied over, so the semantic tagging would be lost, and if the copier picked up the semantically tagged disclaimer, they'd pick up a plain text disclaimer, too.",1268763718

Often half the score isn't displayed yet, and it's impossible to look ahead. This made it difficult to actually play to the score at full speed. Would it be possible to do more aggressive caching/pre-rendering to make it smoother?<p>- You went to all the work to make a great store navigation UI, but the ""My Music"" UI is cover flow only. Even after downloading just a few pieces, it was clunky and slow to find anything. My Music desperately needs better navigation.<p>- The modal dialog that pops up in the store when done downloading is really annoying, especially because navigation is locked as its preparing to display. The download icon already has a badge to show the download status, why do I need the modal reminder? It just disrupts the flow.<p>Suggestions<p>- A very handy feature for students would be to show different colors for the different hands in the keyboard view, and show what finger should be playing the note.<p>- A difficulty sort in the store could be handy. Or at least a ""beginner"" category in the styles.<p>- I realize I can use the volume switch, but a mute button in the app would be nice.
