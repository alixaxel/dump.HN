It's true that many VCs will shy away from adult but not for the reasons you might think.<p>Whether or not YC will back your ""hack"" should be secondary to whether or not you can create a credible business. Youporn was a ""hack"" created by 2 guys and is now despised by the rest of the industry and is largey credited as letting pandora out of the box. They're also not rolling in cash. If you have a solution to ""solve"" the current situation adult publishers face then you've got something of real value.<p>The adult industry is in an awful state due to the rise of free sites and talent brain drain over the years. That makes for a perfect environment for companies to try and innovate in this sector and do what Apple did for music - but you've got to understand the business before you try to fix it. And being a consumer of the product is a lot different than creating a business out of it.",1268715642

And yet, only there you will find excessive violence, disease and rampant drug use. The reason for that is that by making it illegal the 'sex workers' as they're called get pushed in to being criminals, and that means they lose the protection that every other person is normally given. They can not go to the police when a customer (or their pimp) beats them up. They tend to have unsafe sex, the tend to use drugs.<p>Whereas in places where prostitution is legal prostitutes are treated no different from other professionals, they pay their taxes, they are protected by the law from their customers, instead of their pimps, they get regular medical checkups and so on.<p>With porn, it is similar. There are <i>lots</i> of people that simply enjoy it. Just like lots of people simply enjoy sex.<p>Looking at it doesn't make you go blind, it won't 'harm your family'.<p>As long as all parties involved in the consumption and the production of it are adults and are doing it of their own free will I have absolutely no problem with it.<p>As I wrote above, I have a website that has an 'adult part'. It was never my intention to be the webmaster of a site that is NSFW.<p>But when it happened I learned something about my self. That I'm probably more of a prude than I ever thought I was, mostly because the fact that I thought that these people were using my software for a purpose that I could not even envision were somehow betraying me.<p>But I learned over time that I was wrong.<p>They simply have a different viewpoint than I do, and they are - to put it bluntly - right, and I was wrong. And they are completely in the right to use the software that I put in to the world to use for whatever purpose they feel like, as long as it is legal.<p>They're in their own houses, they are safe from stalkers and other real life nuisances, and they enjoy what they do, be it that they're nudists or people that get it on in front of the cam, whatever works for them.<p>So, I learned to control my 'kill' instincts, and let go of it.<p>The practical upshot of that is that we have a website which is separated in to two portions, one that is non-adult, and one that is adult.<p>The non-adult cams are about 85%, about 15% is adult.<p>On the viewer side it is probably the reverse.<p>People are asked to label their content using a switch in the software, and any abuse of that switch (there are always jerks) is punished by a very permanent ban.<p>So, we all get to live in peace, those that care for porn, and those that don't.<p>As for my reasons for wanting to get out of this, I've been doing it for more than a decade and it is really time for fresh blood, besides that as I said I never wanted to be the webmaster of a NSFW site.<p>But that's my limitation, not one of the people on that site.",1268715606
