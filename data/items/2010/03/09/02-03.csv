1177335,comment,1176369,1177291,0,0,Xurinos,,,"<i>The bits were never a scarcity.</i><p>Software sellers have attempted to make them so with the use of legal wording, sternly-worded threats, and excellent politics.  Before it was easy to transmit things electronically, we had to pass around physical media that held them if we wanted to share with others.<p>Excepting people trying to inch out that extra cent out of people, nobody thinks there is something wrong with this sharing.  You can borrow a car, borrow a book, borrow an NES cartridge, even borrow a whole computer, and this is seen as socially acceptable (we learned the value of sharing in Kindergarten).  Sometimes you determine that you want this item for yourself, so you buy it, and you might not have bought it at all had it not been for your exposure to and enjoyment of it.<p>The problem with PC software is that unlike these other works of art, it is trivial to copy.  That should be a warning flag that a business model around software needs to approach things a little differently.  Sure, a good percentage of people will look for something for nothing and feel no guilt over it, will not try to compensate for it; in this medium, they will often succeed, too.  This is a fact of the technology.<p><i>The creative work and thousands of man-hours</i><p>This is noble, but do you really expect customers to offer up money for software because of the actions of somebody behind the scenes of that software?  I know when I browse games on the shelves, I am not thinking about the programmers, the artists, the voice actors, the publishers, or anyone else involved.  I am thinking of how fun I expect that game to be and if I can afford it this month.  I am also thinking of the brand of that game; for example, Ubisoft has disappointed me enough times with their MMOs that I refuse to be fooled again, no matter how cool it looks.  On the other hand, I am a consistent sucker for games by Square and Bioware.  Your average consumer does not place the same value on the workers as the workers place on themselves.<p><i>Companies aren't going to change their business model  because they don't need to. The games are still just as  good, people are playing them, they just aren't paying  for them.</i><p>This is a contradiction.  Admittedly, DRM is one way to change the business model.  It is working for some companies in the way it is implemented.  As you mention later, competition can demonstrate this model's weaknesses, but that is also the nature of business: you must keep evolving to meet the challenges of the times.",1268103313

That's certainly not the intended purpose,<p>Agreed, but that's what we're hackers for right ?<p>> and if that were a reasonable defense, what's to stop the spammers from employing it as an offense?<p>That they didn't have the URL, but the google bot did.<p>> As far as I can tell, you use a sitemap if your site doesn't map in the normal way.<p>Or if your site has crappy navigation, or if you want to comply with some countries' accessibility rules.<p>> Even then, it's not nearly as effective as a text site with any in-links - so much so that I wouldn't hinge any SEO strategy on a sitemap, and I wouldn't recommend setting one up to any new start-up founder.<p>Agreed, but we're not all <i>just</i> start-up founders, and even if we are we're not all above using the occasional trick to get an edge.<p>> Even if your observations on this are correct, then you are a very special case.<p>That's possible.<p>> It's also worth pointing out that it seems your site map was no defense until you took other measures, which wasn't clear from your original post:<p>""so at some point I shut that down and submitted the site to google""<p>The thing I shut down was the publicly accessible version of the map, so only google had access to the real thing.<p>> Responding to some of your points:<p>""I get about 50 emails daily confirming that the strategy worked...""<p>* This confirms that your site is indexed, but it doesn't confirm your strategy beat the spammers. It may be more of Google's algorithms deciding you are best, no? I can't say for sure obviously, but you might have fared better if you hadn't done this at all.<p>Google keeps something called a 'quad' list if I'm not mistaken, which contains a series of word ids in sets of four for every page that exists in their index. If certain sets of 'quads' are unique to your page then those are used to judge your page as original for that bit of content. I gather that quite a few of the 'random keywords spam pages' are built on that predicate. I'm not sure if that is outdated or even plainly wrong but it would explain the pattern in clone sites sometimes ranking higher than the originals simply because they got crawled earlier.<p>> ""Even today that crawl isn't 100% complete yet""<p>* Part of the reason for this is because your pages have a low-priority to be crawled, because they are submitted via a site map.<p>That's quite possible, but I'm not in a hurry. The project was huge and if it takes a year to get it indexed I'm perfectly content with that.<p>The 197,000 pages result in about 7000 unique visitors daily, the total number of pages is in the millions.",1268103300

Breaking this negative feedback loop is priority #1 -- debt can be paid back later, and if you've been breaking out your counter-cyclical toolkit, you've already lowered interest rates to near-zero so this is really cheap debt, 1% interest or lower -- if you produce any return at all, you've got a win in addition to the counter-cyclical effects.<p>Once you've decided to spend, you've got to decide how.  Giving money to people in lump sums (which was in fact about 40% of the bill, the bill was 40% tax cuts) is fast and simple, so it certainly has a place, but keeping people in a job is far more effective because you create externalities.  That job is producing something of value to the economy, that person is gaining skills/experience leading to future employability, and assuming that business is ok, their labor might lead to additional job openings at the same company later.  These are all sustainable improvements that build on themselves and contribute back towards that positive feedback loop.
