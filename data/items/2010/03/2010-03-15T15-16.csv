You can also use marital status or interest in having kids if you prefer... Doing background checks that are not strictly work related is a huge issue. Your example is work related, so I empathize with your desire to know about it. But looking into non-employment behaviour opens up a huge can of worms... For employees and employers.",1268668791

1193171,comment,1192737,1193119,0,0,jerf,,,"The evidence would abundantly suggest that merely being exposed to this idea in a course is not sufficient to guarantee that the resulting scientist will have any clue.<p>I see two problems here: First, by the time you get to that level of schooling, you've developed a ""resistance"" (for lack of a better term) to schooling. That is, you've long since internalized the fact that there are two worlds, the one described in school and the <i>real</i> world, and the overlap between the two is tenuous at best. Merely being told about this stuff in the school world isn't enough, you somehow need it to be penetrated down to the ""real"" world. Computer scientists get a bit of an advantage here in that after being told about this, their homework assignment will generally be to <i>implement</i> the situations described and verify the results. Computer courses are rather good at bridging this gap; most disciplines lack the equivalent and a shocking amount of basic stuff is safely locked away in the ""schooling"" portion of the world for most people.<p>This is a result of the second part of the problem, which is that the teachers themselves help create this environment. I went up the computer science grad school approach for this stuff, where not only do they show you the fundamental math, they make you actually implement it (like I said above). I got to watch my wife go up through the biology stats course, and they don't do that. At the time I didn't notice how bad it was, but the stats courses they do are <i>terrible</i>; they teach a variety of ""leaf node"" techniques (that is, the final results of the other math), but they never teach the actual prerequisites for using the techniques, and in the end it is nothing but voodoo. Students who consign this stuff to ""in the school world but not real"" are, arguably, being <i>more</i> rational than those who don't; things like confidence interval and p-values are only applicable in Gaussian domains, and I know they say that at some point but they don't ever cover anything else from what I can see. By never connecting it to the real world (very well) and indeed treating in the courses as a bit of voodoo (""wave this statistical chicken over the data and it will squawk the answer, which you will then write in your paper"") they contribute to the division between school and real.<p>So, I'd say two things: Those who say this stuff is taught in ""any college stats course"" are probably actually literally wrong in that it is possible to take a lot of stats without really covering this, and secondly, even if covered, it ends up categorized away unless great efforts are taken to ""make it real"" for the student, which, short of forcing implementation on the students (impractical in general) I'm not sure how to do. Most <i>scientists</i> seem to come out of PhD programs with a very thin understanding of this stuff.",1268667536

1193164,comment,1191861,1192099,0,0,thwarted,,,"You'd have be stupid to disagree with that.  But there's a difference between ""most efficient"" and ""efficient at all"".  I've seen Excel spreadsheets used to track orders, at a rate of 100 or so a day.  Then it gets too big so new spreadsheet files are used and the filenames are dated (using inconsistent date formats, making it difficult to find a spreadsheet for a specific date range, and none of the regular users thought to rename the files).  But finding historical orders is a nightmare because the order numbers are not based on dates.  And two people need to edit the same spreadsheet at the same time, or someone gets the bright idea that they'll be more efficient if multiple people can enter the orders, so someone makes a copy of the current master, and the changes never get merged in.  So there's duplicated data or data for overlapping date ranges in multiple files and no authority on which data is valid, it needs to be looked at every time to find out which one is the ""real"" version.  But even that's hard because columns have been added and removed and reordered on all of them.  And most of these issues are not even a matter of ""using the right tool for the job"", even though the root problem is just that; they are caused by not spending even a half-hour to think about things before doing them, and not having enough experience to say ""boy, this is a real headache to deal with"".  So inefficiencies get piled on top of inefficiencies, all in the name of automation.  And the few clueful people who are forced to use the system end up with a bad impression of computers.<p>If an ostensibly talented developer creates a system like that, they can remove ""ostensibly talented"" from their title.",1268667161

Email is useless without other people using Email.  So is a chat program.  Wave is useless without other people as well.  This is why Wave isn't based around Google, but rather, a protocol that anyone can use.<p>Consider that email was first 'invented' in the early 70's, and SMTP in the early 80's, emails adoption speed was comparable to that of a glacier in terms of todays adoption speeds.<p>Wave is such a big undertaking that even Google will have to work hard to move it forward.  But consider for a moment how much work is involved with email, and yet, today, how easy it is to integrate with your average website.  Indeed, we don't think about how much is built on email.  It's wide spread use lets us forget that it would be useless if no one else used it.<p>So yes, while the Google Wave client is still in its infancy, and Wave itself is still an early idea, the idea and what it represents is major.  Email, IM, Social Networking, etc, won't be replaced by Wave, much like none of these replaced Email as a means to communicate.  Rather, Wave will become apart of these means of communication.  Wave is the protocol that allows for this communication.<p>Something as simple as Hacker News comments could easily be a wave, and it wouldn't require us, the users to do anything, yet we could benefit greatly from Wave being apart of the system.<p>So every time I see someone complain about Wave, I can't help but think that they would have said the same thing about email when it first appeared.",1268666339

  Add up these 5000 variables multiplied by these factors to get the score
then I wouldn't believe it. But I think he said something much closer to (on p. 13 of the 98 paper):
  We tried a couple of combinations of variables, that we had hypotheses for. One combination gives a very accurate predictor (Table 1, Husband high negativity). Two others are also accurate (Table 1, low negativity by husband or wife.)<p>I think where the paper went wrong, and what the Slate article is criticising is the claim made in the second column of p. 16, where they do seem to put all the variables into a model and pull the answer from nowhere.
