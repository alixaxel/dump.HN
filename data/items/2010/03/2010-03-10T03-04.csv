Many smart people have dumb ideas that will never make money.  Art generally doesn't make you money (even some of the most famous artists were poor their entire lives).

If you are intelligent, you will find a way to be successful.  Any great college graduates that are stuck waiting tables have other issues.

It's this sense of entitlement that is ruining the US, not a devalued culture.<p>""Let me guess. You got really sick outside of the US and experienced another country's health system.

I would rather have the choice of a good system than be forced into a mediocre one.  Pretty much all of the people I know from Canada have come over here for any major surgery.  If the universal health care is so much better, why would this happen?<p>""We have the same problems and potentially life-wrecking bills.""<p>Universal health care isn't free.
