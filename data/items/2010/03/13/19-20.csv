The amount of code in production (this is something where langpop.com likely falls short: I can't think of any way of getting data on all the COBOL out there without paying through the nose for it) certainly counts for something in terms of popularity, but so does the language most people know some of.

I've used a lot of them, however there are some downsides.<p>1) By constantly making people feel good about themselves, you create a sense of entitlement and pride which can be very difficult to work with when you need them to stand down.

1189480,comment,1188046,1188507,0,0,mhartl,,,"There's nothing wrong with monetizing content, but I think the main issue is that Andrew didn't manage expectations effectively. If Mixergy had started with a hint of a commercial angle, it would have telegraphed the change and softened the blow. Instead, many Mixergy fans (including me) thought that Mixergy was a feel-good project ""giving back"" to the entrepreneur community, and we felt blindsided by what seemed like a sudden shift in emphasis.<p>That's not to say the balancing act is easy. I'm working on a Ruby on Rails tutorial project (<a href=""http://www.railstutorial.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.railstutorial.org/</a>) that definitely has an altruistic component, and it has been a challenge to indicate that it's not a charity. For example, although I'm giving away the HTML version of the book, I've emphasized that I'll eventually be selling a screencast version of the tutorial. I'm also offering ""Unlimited free downloads [of the PDF version] 'til the book is done"", which creates the expectation that I may eventually charge for the PDF.<p>Managing expectations is an art, and even highly capable people sometimes blow it. Imagine how much friendlier the reception to Arc would have been if pg had soft-launched it in '03 rather than writing essays about it for half a decade and calling it the ""hundred-year language"". It was pretty hard to live up to those expectations.",1268509899

1189473,comment,1189142,1189328,0,0,dasil003,,,"I'm really just beginning to learn Haskell while working professionally with Ruby.  My gut instinct is that with Haskell you have to put in a lot of extra effort but you are repaid doubly in robustness.  Obviously in real world scenarios there is a balance to be struck since a lot of code is just for throw-away purposes, or failure around edge cases does not affect the bottom line.  However I suspect that the lack of traction Haskell gets in the commercial software world is more a result of human nature than actual economics of long-lived software projects.<p>The reason I'm bullish on Haskell is because I suspect it can be a significant competitive advantage in a lot of the type of data processing scenarios that start out simple in a startup, but can become slow/buggy/unmaintainable over time.",1268509649

I think this is a good stat for open mindedness -- it's simply wise to personally use the best products out there.<p>It blows my mind when I see companies have a dogma that everything they do is the absolute best. While it is a good thing to believe in your products, it is another thing to be dogmatic in extreme ways about what products you should use.<p>I think the more extreme example of this is web stacks. Microsoft and Apple both seem to suffer from this not-invented-here syndrome around .NET and/or WebObjects, and the browsers they create. I speculate there are just massive losses in productivity there, simply because open source produces better web tools.
