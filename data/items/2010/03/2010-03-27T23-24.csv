1223939,comment,1222956,1223668,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> He's dealing with a self-described ""student of history"" who puts up a slew of easily-demolished false claims<p>So easily demolish them. I'm here for discussion, if I made a mistake, let me know. I said I wanted to hear and address opposing points of view, and I'm clarifying and trying to answer all the questions and feedback I get.<p>Actually, I'll be honest - the format I'm getting responses in is difficult for me to keep up with. People write eight questions/counterpoints. I answer all eight. Then they nitpick two of them and ask for all sorts of data and proof from me. They don't say, ""Hey, those six points you made? Those are good points, and I now agree."" They just ignore the responses and pick a single sentence or two that they can quote out of context and nitpick with. But I'm trying to address and answer them all in good faith - if someone takes the time to write an intelligent response to me, I'll try take the time to cite clarifying and supporting information.<p>So if I'm making false claims, please do point them out and let's discuss. I've stated, I don't know, 30-70 historical facts in almost 10 replies. I've given my personal opinions on governance based on those. If you disagree, jump in, I've had some really good discussions in this thread, and I'm learning, and apparently some other people are learning because they're voting up my comments and the people I'm discussing with, which is good.<p>> before retreating behind Well, gee, don't you think the British meant well in conquering and occupying your country?<p>Mate, it's called having a discussion. Someone has a drastically different opinion than me, and instead of just putting my fingers in my ears and saying ""la la la I'm right la la la"" I ask what their personal feelings are. The snark doesn't add much, but if you feel I'm mistaken, then go ahead and weigh in, point it out. If I'm mistaken on facts, I want to be corrected, and a couple people have pointed out other facts for me to consider and linked to them. If you don't agree with my opinions, do feel welcome to share your own, and perhaps I can evolve my opinions if you make a good case. Don't just say, ""slew of easily-demolished false claims"" without pointing out what they are - go ahead and demolish them. It doesn't hurt my feelings, and we all can learn from it.",1269734141

1223908,comment,1223287,1223287,0,0,mschaecher,,,"More of a UX suggestion, but I think you need to explain the purpose and why of the site better.  If it wasn't for your statement on here about what the site is meant to be, it would have been even less clear to me.  What is the value proposition?<p>The 'What's This' tip links and the 'About' section aren't working.<p>Under the choose your algorithm sections, when I select one of the choices it highlights the choice, but nothing else changes.  This leaves me unsure if they are not working or if I am doing something wrong.<p>There are also a lot of people out there who might not be familiar with the term algorithm, even less understand what they actually mean.  If you are aiming to reach 'normals' it might be helpful to use more common language like filters instead of algorithms.<p>Same thing with the copy where you describe the algorithms.  To me, it seems like you are describing more how the algorithms function...rather than how it will effect what I see as a user.  I'd say figure out in plain, concise language what the benefits of each 'filter' are to the user.<p>Terms like renewal rates, site voting power, and slow rate change don't convey to the average user how each filter effects them.  I think a good place for including and describing these terms is probably in the 'What's This' tool tip for that section.<p>I'm not sure what the purpose of the 'State of Social Media' section is.  What does that mean for the user?  Why is it important to the user?  What exactly does that information tell me?<p>The site source labels do look like buttons as tjpick mentioned.  But I would also add that the Reddit and Tweetmeme labels look/are the same at least for background color.  When I scroll the page almost all of the submissions are from Reddit and Tweetmeme, except for one for digg.  Since the green is so much more pronounced than the grays used on the other two, I feel like it is highlighting it as something special I should look at or click.  I would use the gray background color for all of them, and just use different colored font(maybe with a more pronounced font so colors(sites) are easily distinguished).<p>The gray description text is hard for me to read, in that I actually have to try and focus on reading it.  The submission time and user are highlighted which usually signals important information in context to the info around them.  Is that the important information you want to highlight?  Seems to me like those are second or third tier pieces of info, where text like the description, site source, etc., are actually the important/useful parts.<p>Need a footer.  Footer makes it clear that this is the end.  Right now it looks like the page just hasn't loaded entirely because I was expecting to be able to go through multiple pages.",1269733040

He is always protecting his neck, the vulnerability during communication.<p>2) The Body Language Expert reads into Schmidts rounded shoulders as meaning he is afraid of Jobs. Could be. However, as a geek at heart, this is the posture of one who spends a ton of time in front of a computer and doesn't get much excercise (not that I know that about schmidt).

In Apple's case, by shutting down preorders they generate press just because they're declaring it full. If you open a site to beta traffic with signup, then get coverage at a place like Techcruch, and shut down signups with only 10 users but don't delcare it, the press will think you're a hot item if you don't provide numbers.<p>That isn't exactly the case with Apple, of course -- they are a hot item.

If you claimed he was rubbish, I'd ask for supporting evidence.<p>But when you say ESR is useless, I can't name projects he's worked on like git, but that doesn't mean they don't exist - for all I know he might have worked on something I've never heard of, or something big I don't associate with his name.<p>So when you throw your dislike for ESR around, that cuts to the quick of the issue for you, because you already know why you dislike him. ""Oh don't read it, it's ESR"" is enough for you. To cut to the quick for me, you would need to say something like:<p>""ESR worked on Projects X and Y which both failed, his results aren't as good as his talk, beware"".<p>I hope all the people who upvoted you did so because they know why they dislike ESR and agree with you. I fear that the people who upvoted you did so because they know other people they respect dislike ESR and want to demonstrate their group membership credentials by supporting the popular view.<p>I don't hate ESR (as shouted in my earlier post) and I also don't like his patronising village elder tone, but I do like and can fit into experiences in my life the idea that running things from one person's head is the business equivalent of a code smell, and that the pain for them of changing it soon will result in smoother operations for everyone else sooner and smoother operations for them too later.<p>> for instance, note the timestamps on the comments<p>OK.",1269731765

It's fashionable these days to bash colonialism, but my understanding is that the British generally tried to do right by the people they governed. </i><p>Chaudhuri's take is pretty interesting.  He found most administrators to be generally capable and well meaning.  The ex-patriots living in India he found to be quite patronizing and racist.  They may have been well meaning, but in that ""Bauno cares about Africa"" sort of way.<p>GDP stats are created in a political sausage factory, you cannot take claims of ""12% growth"" or of shrinking GDP at anything like face value.<p>It's not fair to compare India to Japan, because Japan had a lot of human and cultural capital that India did not have.  Japan's low GDP in 1945 was a result of war time destruction, before the war it was an industrialized country that already was way ahead of India.<p>But it's also not fair to compare present India to colonial India, and claim that the current government is better because certain indicators are better now.  Life expectancy went up because of medical advances in other nations (penicillin, etc) that India imported.  We have no definitive way of knowing how a 2010 British ruled India would compare to the actual India.
