A FAQ allows one to explain something in a sort of dialectic, giving me not only the information I would have received just by reading the site, but also helping me to better understand the mind of the author. It acts as a summary of what the author sees as the most relevant points, or essential knowledge  and is arranged (usually) in a more readable format for me at least, than of the large paragraphs elsewhere on a site.<p>In fact, the OP demonstrates this value by writing his post in the format. He, likely meant to be ironic, but I was much better able to understand the intent of each segment of the article because it's title was in the form of a question. I knew going in, what I was supposed to learn from each segment.<p>I took studying classes back in highschool and I remember that they taught me to read books in several  passes. The first pass is to give you a general idea of what is being discussed to give you an opportunity to form questions which can be answered on the second pass. A third pass can be used to addr3ess any questions brought up by the second, and so on. This kind of learning is supported by FAQs in that they allow one to largely skip the first step.<p>IMHO",1270043431

However, it's certainly not inconceivable that such a correlation might be highly misleading. Here are two simple thought experiments to illustrate this.<p>1. Suppose that in every country, in every year GDP growth is exactly proportional to government spending the previous year. In other words, spending more produces immediate GDP gains. And suppose that government spending generally changes quite slowly, within certain limits.<p>Then low spending at the start of a decade will correlate with increasing spending over the decade (because of regression to the mean) and therefore with increasing GDP growth over the decade (because of the assumed relationship between spending and GDP growth). So we'll get a graph rather like that one despite the fact that the real relationship between spending and GDP growth is <i>positive</i>.<p>2. Suppose that GDP growth is entirely independent of government spending, and that it depends on some other characteristics of a country; that high-growth countries tend also to be rich ones (as they would, having grown faster in the past); that all countries would (with equal patterns of taxation and government spending) have roughly equal levels of inequality, so that poorer countries have more really poor people; and that government spending is dominated by attempts to give the poorest people a decent life.<p>Then the poorer countries will spend more, because they have more people who need government assistance to keep out of severe poverty; they will also have less growth (by our assumptions); so we'll see a correlation like the one in the graph, even though there is (by assumption) no causal relationship between government spending and GDP growth.<p>Of course these are both likely to be much simpler than the truth. But then, so is the model you're implicitly relying on if you point to the graph and say ""see, government spending inhibits growth"" without further analysis. (That model would be something like: GDP growth is purely a function of government spending over the previous decade, and nothing else.)",1270043208

It's built directly on the Prussian education system:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_education_system"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_education_system</a><p>""The Prussian education system was a system of mandatory education dating to the early 19th century. Parts of the Prussian education system have served as models for the education systems in a number of other countries, including Japan and the United States.""<p>""Seeking to replace the controlling functions of the local aristocracy, the Prussian court attempted to instill social obedience in the citizens through indoctrination. Every individual had to become convinced, in the core of his being, that the King was just, his decisions always right, and the need for obedience paramount.""<p>""The schools imposed an official language to the prejudice of ethnic groups living in Prussia. The purpose of the system was to instill loyalty to the Crown and to train young men for the military and the bureaucracy. As the German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte, a key influence on the system, said, ""If you want to influence [the student] at all, you must do more than merely talk to him; you must fashion him, and fashion him in such a way that he simply cannot will otherwise than what you wish him to will.""<p>But - no, I firmly reject that the Prussian system with its heavy importance on obedience is necessary for a healthy society. I think if they announced today that they're going to dump the entire U.S. education system at the end of 2011, no transition, no new programs, nothing - a better system would emerge by 2012.<p>>  He observes that you couldn't get many employees back in the day, before the Civil War - because they were all equally entrepreneurial - meaning that they'll only stick with you for a year or two before striking it out on their own.<p>People <i>should</i> move in and out of entrepreneurship and employment under others, based on what their preferences are at the time. The fact that starting your own business or working for yourself for a little while is seen as this huge deal in the States is a problem. People are in awe - ""you run your <i>own business</i>? wow..."" It shouldn't be such a big deal. You work for someone else if they've got a good thing going and you want to learn from them, or want more stability for a while. You save up some cash, and strike it on your own for a while. If you sell or close the business, maybe you get into working for someone else because you can make a meaningful contribution in their organization and the pace of work is slower and more enjoyable, or you want stability again. That's a more natural state of affairs. The current educational system with its focus on doing exactly what you're told to do is no good. We need something better.",1270042918

The way this works is that people will work less hard, or take less trouble to do more lucrative and presumably more valuable work, if their taxes are higher. The way <i>this</i> works is that people compare the effort they have to exert with the goods and services they can get, which assuming sensible exchange rates is basically the same thing as absolute income; so demotivation is, so to speak, a function of income; so to measure how demotivated our workers are by tax we should look at their taxes in absolute terms.""<p>(I don't know whether that's what Mankiw has in mind, but it's the most plausible argument I can come up with that looks at all like what he said.)<p>I'll also mention another argument for measuring tax per person, which I don't think Mankiw hints at at all but which seems at least as persuasive as his argument: the purpose of taxation is to provide the people with benefits, typically somewhat evenly spread across the population or a substantial fraction of it; so the benefit provided per person is roughly a function of tax per person.<p>There seem to me to be several substantial problems with (what I'm guessing to be) Mankiw'sargument, and also with the other argument I mention above, even if we consider only ""modern Western economies"". Here are some:<p>1. The prices of goods and services are not at all constant across countries. Unfortunately, there also isn't any simple relationship between these prices and GDP, so it's not clear how to correct for this. (If relevant goods have prices perfectly constant across countries, demotivation is a function of tax per person. If they have prices exactly proportional to GDP, demotivation is a function of tax over GDP. Neither of these simple cases is common.)<p>2. Some particular goods, including some of great importance for the sort of demotivational effect I think he has in mind, have prices that correlate very strongly with GDP. Notably, houses tend to be more expensive in more affluent countries and cheaper in less affluent countries.<p>3. It's well established that most people care a lot about status, which goes along with relative income. So one particular and important ""good"", namely one's level of relative wealth, does in fact vary more or less in proportion to GDP. This observation is relevant to both arguments: the demotivational force of a given level of taxation will (in so far as it depends on status) be determined by tax / GDP rather than tax / population, and the cost of ensuring that no one is too poor <i>in relative terms</i> will also be determined by tax / GDP.<p>4. The diminishing marginal utility of money means that the richer a nation is, the more effective an average tax dollar is when spent on scalable things (e.g., infrastructure) or benefits for the worse-off, relative to the benefit it would have provided if it hadn't been taken in tax. (And, hence, also relative to the demotivational effect of taxing it.)",1270042308
