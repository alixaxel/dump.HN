1178214,story,,,2,0,dhalla,"Ask HN: What are your strategies for marketing on FB/Twitter",,"There's a lot of literature out there on best practices and times to send out your email marketing, but I was wondering if there was similar thought leadership on social media tools such as the ones mentioned. I'd be interested in hearing whatever thoughts the community has but some specific questions I have include:
1. When is the best time in the week to share something with your fan club (kind of like how we know Wed afternoon is the best time to send out an email)
2. Have you found FB ads worked directing people towards your fan page and if so, why?
3. Are you more likely to get followers on twitter if you follow them first? 
4. Is it a good approach for a company to message back/RT people who have matched a keyword that you've searched.<p>Thanks in advance for any insights you might have",1268143177

You can't force any of your co-workers to leave with you, and if they're happy where they are most of them won't. If the company sucks, a Good Friend would try to take as many with him as possible when he found something better. That's just people helping other people out of crappy situations.<p>I've heard some people espouse the idea that there might be some ethical misconduct in courting [soon-to-be] ex-co-workers. I don't see any basis for that belief. Again, the most you can do is make an offer; if your company's staff is all going to jump ship when someone comes to them with vague and shakey musings about founding a startup together, that should really tell you something about the company you work for. There's nothing wrong with making a proposition, imo.<p>I have worked with people who have signed oppressive contracts. I find it deeply sad that some people have done that. Neither of my co-workers from my last job would be available if I wanted to proposition them, as they are both engaged in multi-year contracts which state departure before Month Year is punishable by big, big financial penalties. Only for the employee, of course; the employer can terminate them at its leisure without any responsibility according to these documents.",1268142970

TechCrunch is one of the biggest blogs on the planet; they're not using a generic template.  While the design isn't copy and pasted, it is clearly really heavily influenced- imagine if a site did that with, say, TC articles.  That would be plagiarism.  Why is copying a design any different?<p>None of these alone are definitive, but together, they make a pretty good case:<p><pre><code>  - Search on top left, with a button titled ""Search""
  - #CCC box around the header
  - Header: Logo/Ad on the top, links and icons on the bottom; partitioned the same way
  - Spacing and style of the navigation is really similar
  - Three article images across the top: images are both 203x155, and the box has a blue padding and darker blue border.  Both are named #header_features, inside a #col1 (admittedly, naming conventions might be a WP thing).
  - Boxed in articles with the title and author/date on left; comments + social media on right (this is admittedly generic.. but it does have a TC feel to it)
  - Article meta data and the article itself are split by a dotted gray line
</code></pre>
It was designed by ""YourCustomBlog,"" and their portfolio (<a href=""http://yourcustomblog.com/wordpress-design-portfolio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yourcustomblog.com/wordpress-design-portfolio/</a>) indicates it wasn't just a ""customization"" (meaning, it was a made-from-scratch design, not a modification of an existing template.",1268140763

Extreme examples include 1937, when capital in the US went on strike and we had the Recession of 1937–1938 and didn't really recover until WWII changed the game.<p>In serious times of trouble, can you point out examples where this has worked in more than the short term?  It didn't for the US in the Great Depression, and Japan is now nearing the end of it's second lost decade (we through they were pulling out of it, but that turned out to be a side effect of the world wide bubble that popped a little later this decade).",1268139775
