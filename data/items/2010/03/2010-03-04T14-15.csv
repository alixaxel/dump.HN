1167058,comment,1166638,1166953,0,0,jayair,,,"I think the relationship between IQ and effort is due to two factors upbringing and our understanding of the self. The upbringing factor is easy to see; a smarter child doesn't work as hard growing up since he isn't challenged enough in school. You went into this in your article.<p>The understanding of the self however is a little more tricky. The more we understand what makes us happy on the inside, the more the value of the world on the outside decreases. You mentioned becoming a CEO; I think a person with a high IQ who has a good understanding of him/herself has a pretty good idea what he/her wants. And there is a very little chance that the ""CEO"" position can offer all or most of that. Jobs and positions in the real world rarely translate perfectly to what we want in our minds. Also, smarter people do a better job of synthesizing their future in their minds; they tend to look farther into the future. So essentially they are looking at the future wondering, why do I have to work harder to get to a position that offers very little of what I want.<p>You can argue that the CEO position is really quite valuable and that the smarter person should want it. But a side effect of their  ""easier"" upbringing also means that they don't have the desire to work hard for things.<p>I think the biggest part of working hard is to trick your brain into thinking you want the outcome that the hard work is going to bring.",1267714789

We tend not to believe in the next big war or economic swing; we certainly don't believe in the next big software revolution.<p>2. Because we don't believe in technological change (we only say we do), we accept bad computer products with a shrug; we work around them, make the best of them and (like fatalistic sixteenth-century French peasants) barely even notice their defects — instead of demanding that they be fixed and changed.</i><p>Collorary: If you want aim for something world-changing, you need to aim high enough that most Slashdotters won't immediately get it and say ""meh.""<p>I think this level may be out of the reach of most startups now.

It's like a brilliant lisp coder vs a mediocre C++ programmer. The C++ programmer will be much faster than the lisp programmer in achieving some task using C++, simply because he has past training.<p>So basically, the effort put in over time will keep you ahead of any competition, unless a person of superior inherent ability also decides to put in effort in the same area you are in.<p>Will an ambitious person always find something to challenge their abilities? I know many people who are ambitious - they talk about money all the time. But if you observe their actions, they are basically doing nothing, or doing something unimportant and easy.<p>I'm not convinced there is a correlation between ambition and an active search for things that are difficult to do. I'm sure there is such a subset of people, but the proportion compared to those who are content with not challenging themselves, I believe, is low.

1167017,comment,1166638,1166638,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"From Hamming's ""You and Your Research"":<p><pre><code>  You observe that most great scientists have tremendous
  drive. I worked for ten years with John Tukey at Bell
  Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day about three or
  four years after I joined, I discovered that John Tukey
  was slightly younger than I was. John was a genius and
  I clearly was not. Well I went storming into Bode's
  office and said, ``How can anybody my age know as much
  as John Tukey does?'' He leaned back in his chair, put
  his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said,
  ""You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know
  if you worked as hard as he did that many years.""

  I simply slunk out of the office!

  What Bode was saying was this: ""Knowledge and productivity
  are like compound interest."" Given two people of approximately
  the same ability and one person who works ten percent
  more than the other, the latter will more than twice
  outproduce the former. The more you know, the more you
  learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more
  you can do, the more the opportunity - it is very much
  like compound interest. I don't want to give you a rate,
  but it is a very high rate. Given two people with exactly
  the same ability, the one person who manages day in and
  day out to get in one more hour of thinking will be
  tremendously more productive over a lifetime. I took
  Bode's remark to heart; I spent a good deal more of my
  time for some years trying to work a bit harder and I
  found, in fact, I could get more work done. I don't like
  to say it in front of my wife, but I did sort of neglect
  her sometimes; I needed to study. You have to neglect
  things if you intend to get what you want done. There's
  no question about this.

Even with more modern Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, installing and then uninstalling something (say, kubuntu-desktop, to pick an example that happened to me recently) does not leave your system in the same state it was before you started.  Instead, you get (to a GUI user) bizarre random configuration changes, and programs that worked may now not work (or vice versa!).<p>Basically, as someone who switched back to Linux from Mac recently, Synaptic and the Software Center (and why there are two tools that show different-but-overlapping package sets is another WTF) are full of surprises and why-did-THAT-change?! moments.",1267711952

1166920,comment,1166638,1166884,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> Disarming a knife holder is NOT easy.<p>It is. I have been trained in unarmed combat and it is <i>relatively</i> easy with a little training. I personally would be confident of disarming, with minimal or no injury, someone unfamiliar in handling a knife.<p>The first thing to remember is that if you take and maintain control of their wrist it is very hard for them to attack you - and harder to actually do serious damage. Usually they then focus on trying to regain control of the knife - at which point you either reach over with a spare hand and pressure point them into releasing the knife or you hit the solar plexus or whatever is within easy reach - really hard.
EDIT: personally I would drive the heel of your hand into their jaw. It's an easy hit, hard to dodge (as you have their wrist) and big impact.<p>> There is a lot of bullshit in martial arts claims. Being able to dodge bullets, is obviously one of them.<p>Agreed. I think the Hunter story is probably a parable - but Morehei Ueshiba did dodge bullets according to historical accounts [1]. Note that dodging bullets here means he read their body signals and moved <i>out of the path</i> he knew the bullets were going to travel. Still good timing though. Body signal reading is one of the basics of Aikido.<p>> But if you become so cocky you decide to drop your hands and rely on your reflexes, you will be caught by even the worst fighters.<p>Ah... boxing. No disrespect intended here but boxers do get so cocky :D And your right that's where it fails.<p>Martial arts is about discipline. It also trains you <i>not</i> to use reflexes. <i>ever</i> That will get you killed.<p>This comes back to where I mentioned above that waiting to be attacked is the worst move: because you do then have to rely on reflexes to respond. If your attacking your always ahead of your opponent (unless they are also skilled)<p>My personal survival training highlighted one thing: the mantra in a situation where your going to have to fight is - Be first, Be sudden, Be brutal.<p>1.<a href=""http://martialarts.jameshom.com/library/weekly/aa043000.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martialarts.jameshom.com/library/weekly/aa043000.htm</a>",1267711554

For instance, you could give up some speed, using virtualization.<p>If such hack is not available (patents?), it is always possible to come up with a set of rock solid supported devices, might be with some cooperation from hardware vendors. It is exactly how Apple solved this problem, and it seems that regular people are happy to accept such restrictions, as long as everything works <i>great</i>.<p>Right now, the problem is that if you install Linux on your computer, the official story is that ""Linux supports more hardware than any other OS"". Last time I checked (6 months ago), though, hibernation is still problematic, and you have to Google to ensure that your printer will actually work.<p>As for the UI. To be honest, it is not a technical problem. There will be some technical work involved but it does not matter that much. Linux development focuses too much on technicalities. (I write it as software developer)<p>The biggest issue are fonts. Every time I launch Linux, my eyes hurt. Few hours of work are required to get fonts right and they are still not that good as on OS X or Windows. There is a lot of typography know how available right now, and I bet you'd easily find a top notch typography agency or folks to solve this problem.<p>The second issue is design and basic usability. You do not have to rewrite everything, initally. The things I mean is fixing many small issues, such as mismatched padding everywhere, and UI inconsistencies, as well as running serious usability studies to find how regular people cope with the basic tasks.<p>I think it would be the best to pick XFCE for such improvements. Exactly like big corporations picked WebKit instead of Mozilla's engine. XFCE is modular, still relatively small, not that bloated as GNOME, and you could fork it without too much hassle.<p>Also, it helps a lot that most of the world switches to the web. You longer need to write all possible tools, except good integration with the web. I dream about something like transparent Google Gears integrated into the WM.<p>Paradoxically, I'd start work with porting TextMate to Linux. VIM or emacs are a bit too hardcore for regular developers, and there is no good editor on Linux for dynamic languages, which is light weight, nice and works perfectly within a minute, or two. Developers are crucial part of the infrastructure and Linux does not attract developers with eye for usability.<p>I agree that I might underestimate the costs. I don't think, though, that it is going to take more than $50m, and money is not that big problem, actually. The biggest problem is to realize that current Linux experience sucks a lot for people who do not want to spend their valuable time tweaking settings. The improvement is enormous but it is merely a start.<p>As for multi billion corporations that started and failed, it is not true. Right now, Linux's development is focused on getting servers right. The corporations succeed in this area. RHEL is de facto corporate standard. No one relatively big, except medium-sized Canonical, cares about your mother's experience.<p>BTW. To be honest, I was very surprised it is only $1.4 billion when I read it. Given the scope of the project, I expected few times more. But this is me.",1267711286

But you can lose the value of the patent both at the negotiating table and in the courts if there's a belief you won't enforce it or a belief you suspect it's unenforceable (e.g., if you seem to worry by using it aggressively, you could have it challenged, and lose it).<p>First, as alluded to in the article, note the word ""need"":<p>> <i>""Perhaps it’s a by-product of the suit Apple is engaged in against (and initiated by) Nokia. Apple’s counter-suit against Nokia involves some of the same patents at play here, and perhaps Apple’s lawyers have concluded that they need to enforce them against someone like HTC in order to use them in their counter-suit against Nokia.""</i><p>Second, to quote a non-neutral party, note the phrase ""lax attitude"":<p>> <i>""But neglecting stick licensing has two problems. First, it results in a loss of potential royalty and damages revenues from infringed patents. Second, it undermines carrot licensing of both infringed and noninfringed patents.
