A few years ago Japan increased their money supply by 30%
to dig themselves out of their depression and it failed to work. So increasing the money supply I doubt will work any better here in the U.S.
All those people now being foreclosed on should have had their loan applications disqualified. That responsibility falls to Washington to regulate, not the Federal Reserve, and the biggest scream that ""you can't do that"" would have been Washington, not the Federal Reserve I believe.",1268701683

How about Gmail Labs, which didn't exist 2 years ago, but now lets you skin Gmail, use keyboard shortcuts, embed youtube videos, etc. etc.? Calendar integration, a better text editor, embedded photos, multiple simultaneous attachment uploads w/ progress bars, better filters, incrementally better spam protection, plus the fact that I now have 7.5 gigs of space in my inbox, all while fending off attacks from Chinese hackers?<p>I think you grossly underestimate the amount of things they've accomplished in the past year, and the number of people it takes to run a service this popular. Facebook releases with grandiose redesigns, prompting temporary revolts among their users. Gmail improves incrementally, so much so that I can't imagine living without it as my primary e-mail client, but the sense of novelty that comes with a massive redesign is lost. Personally, I prefer Gmail's approach.",1268701643

So freaking what?<p>""Evidence"" that flimsy wouldn't stand up in a local bar  argument, much less a court of law. The records are still completely and totally anonymous. No names, no addresses, no way to identify anyone...nothing but a strong statistical correlation to a set of ratings in a database.<p>It sounds like they have a problem with the power of predictive modeling and not with the handling of anonymous data. Esstentially what they are saying is ""if we know a little about you, we find can out things that we didn't know with a very high degree of accuracy, but no certainty."". Duh.

In fact, customers already are faced with the decision of ""3G"" vs ""3GS"" when they buy an iPhone.<p>What this suggests is that the solution for Android will be to have some easily-understandable number or naming scheme to roughly classify the power of the phone, so apps don't have to list compatible phones en masse.   For desktop software, most people basically used the required and recommended CPU speed as such a number. Even though it didn't really capture the full nuances of whether an app required more RAM or more CPU, it was a good enough rough metric.",1268701349
