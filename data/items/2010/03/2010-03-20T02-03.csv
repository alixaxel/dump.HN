There's either a different way of doing it, or you can drop down to native code if you must. The latter is just generally not a great idea.<p>JavaScript is an OK language, but it's syntax is far from superior to Objective-C's. More importantly, syntax is irrelevant. What it lacks are features. Features like code importing, and dynamic message passing, and native classical inheritance. Those features (and more) are available at the language level in Objective-J.<p>Not sure what you mean by ""native browser rendering"".<p>The docs aren't great, for sure.
