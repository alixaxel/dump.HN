I think more often than not, instead of a <i>young</i> startup having positive net income, they either have (a) some kind of funding, seed, angel, or VC, or (b) they have some great revenue generation opportunities they can take advantage of (which would also up their valuation).",1269143855

There may also be coding standards to follow, and (ideally) some documentation for new code.<p>If you omit these things when you submit a patch or issue a a pull request you may still think you're doing the project owner a favor, on the premise that something is better than nothing, but reviewing your submissions and checking that it is correct, and possibly cleaning up your code and adding tests, may end up being more work than it's worth.<p>Git and github have removed some obstacles to contributing, but there are still assorted details one has to look after.",1269143757

For me, I simply enjoy the challenge of building something, working hard, and ""seeing where it goes"".  So keep your expectations reasonable.<p>I worked hard on a startup for ~2 years, starting in college and for about a year while I held down a 40hr/week job.  It was pretty clear that after multiple iterations and a splintered team that it wasn't going to succeed.  I know near the end I took a good week off to mentally disengage and try to look at it from an objective perspective as possible.  I talked it over with my co-founders and we ultimately decided it was time to pull the plug.<p>Oddly enough, my first real business venture was a success, and my second one was a failure.  To me, giving up was much harder than succeeding, because I'm not one to give up easily.  I learned a lot from that failure though and am proud to admit to the people who ask that it was a failure, because it's an excellent story.",1269142611
