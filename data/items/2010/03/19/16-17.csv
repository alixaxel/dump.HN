1204553,comment,1204505,1204505,0,0,snitko,,,"It's not the problem of lyrics vs words in the first place. It's a problem of lack of musical education. Give a person a guitar or a piano and within a year she starts paying attention to the composition and performing skills. And her tastes may change dramatically too. So in a sense, I consider ""listening to words"" not as an alternative point of view, but rather a lack of musical training. Sure, words may simply be bad, but they alone usually cannot make song good or bad, while music composition and performing definitely have this power.<p>Also, please do not think of Americans that way. People in general tend to ignore music because they don't have a proper training. Same here in Russia. Same would even be in Japan. I would even rank Americans and Europeans higher, because they're naturally exposed to different quality music a lot more, than any other culture.",1269017867

1204504,comment,1204067,1204067,0,0,anatoly,,,"I applaud the effort, yet deplore the writing. I looked at the first few pages and was dismayed. This isn't a book I would recommend to anyone with no knowledge of graph theory who needs to pick it up.<p>The authors make no effort to connect to someone who either doesn't have the math background, or forgot it since they did their math courses in college X years ago. Look at the very first sentences: they intimidate almost willfully. Before we're ever told what a graph is, we're told that it's very hard to define and there are ""directed graphs, weighted graphs, multigraphs, simple graphs and so on"". Why? What possible benefit is there of saying this except to intimidate? I don't yet know what a graph is - or probably I do intuitively but not exactly. I'm not going to remember all these words!<p>Then ""we start by calling a ""graph"" what some would call an ""unweighted, undirected graph w/o multiple edges"" "". Again, why? What's wrong with saying this five pages on, after you explain something about direction, multiple edges, maybe weights? The tone seems almost hostile in its dryness.<p>Then the definition itself is a perfect specimen of a definition aimed solely at a professional mathematician, who is almost never the intended audience of this book (I assume). An ordered pair of sets? Why? Suppose that I remember well what an ordered pair of sets is; if I'm not a mathematician, I almost certainly don't have the intuition that it's just a shortcut way of specifying ""V and E"". There's no important reason to define a graph as an ordered pair; it's just a formalistic convention. You're not going to be writing out proofs in ZFC about graphs. Even the Sage examples in the book don't follow the (V,E) notation. Why not just say something like ""a graph is defined by a set of vertices V and a set of nodes E, where each node in E connects two vertices in V together""? And immediately follow up with a simple example/picture? And then, after the image is clear to the reader and they understand <i>what it is that you want to model mathematically</i>, then talk about formal ways of representing it, and maybe, if you really want to use it, remind the reader what a cartesian product is, and so on.<p>When you say ""Elements of V are called _vertices_, or _nodes_, and elements of E are called _edges_, or _arcs_"", why not add ""equivalently"" after the ""or""-s? Again, someone who last read a formal definition of this kind X years ago - or never - is not going to <i>immediately</i> understand that you're just introducing synonyms. They're gonna go ""huh? so when is it vertices and when is it nodes?"" at least for a few seconds. Why do that?<p>In fact, I would say that any reader who's at home with the language and the meaning of this definition will be a reader who definitely already knows what an undirected graph is, formally. In other words, someone who needs this definition will almost certainly have to struggle to understand it. This is the opposite of what you want from a definition.<p>And all that - just on the first page!",1269016647

Then since most entertainment is about non-utopias (such as wartime or criminals), we must condemn billions of peoples for producing said entertainment or consuming it.<p>>  That demonstrates a serious lack of empathy.<p>What exactly should I be empathizing about? Should I feel what the psychopaths (don't) feel? Should I sympathize with their victims? (But I don't see how pondering whether Jobs is a psychopath is bad; in fact, victims of all people should be most interested in spotting psychopaths from afar.) I know what it means to empathize with tsunami or earthquake victims, but I'm really mystified as to what you mean that word to mean. To me, your comment looks like a rhetorical tissue of exaggerations and applause lights (<a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/jb/applause_lights/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/jb/applause_lights/</a>).<p>> Seriously though, I don't think a psychopath would have as much interest in changing the world as a young Steve Jobs did, nor would a psychopath name something after his daughter or adopt her into his family.<p>These are much better points. But there are counterpoints; if we go into family relationships, we might learn from Wikipedia:<p>> She [Chrisann Brennan] briefly raised their daughter on welfare when Jobs denied paternity, claiming that he was sterile; he later acknowledged paternity.",1269016389

Emacs can do a momentary highlight of the opening paren/bracket whenever you type the close of the pair.""<p>NO. Sorry but you're doing it wrong. Relying on the editor to highlight parentheses is a highly inefficient and error-prone way to work. It's distracting, it wastes mental cycles and inhibits flow.<p>The correct way is to configure emacs so that when you press a certain key (in my case, right shift because I configured my keyboard so I can activate left shift with my thumb), emacs inserts ""()"" and puts the cursor in the parentheses. No need to remember or count closing parentheses this way.<p>It's been a really long while since I last counted parentheses for ANYTHING. Like, let's say I write a let with one variable, and the value is a really deeply nested expression and now I'm done with it and I want to write the body of the let. What do I do? I DON'T COUNT PARENTHESES. I go back to the opening parenthese for the variable declarations of the let, then I skip over that form (the variable declarations) with C-M-f (forward-sexp), right to the body of the let. Then I use C-j (newline-and-indent) and then I can write the body of the let. (if the value form is really long I might skip a few parentheses and use C-M-b to get back at or near the opening parenthese of the variable declarations).<p>So, executive summary, you walk the structure but you NEVER count parentheses. Like, once every four months I might screw up and delete a parenthese and then the editor and me are both pretty confused, but it's such a total non-issue. And even then, I don't count parentheses a lot because I try to walk the structure by skipping over forms and see what works and what doesn't, and I might tell emacs to reindent some of the code and I immediately see what's wrong. With a proper structure editor, unbalancing the parentheses couldn't even happen.",1269016293

You could have a data-access layer written in JavaScript that when run on the server pulls from the database, and when run on the client pulls it over a REST interface. You could do jQuery-style DOM manipulation on the server for the initial page state, serialize it to HTML to pass to the client, and then do further manipulations on the client using the same code base.

Your IDE will do that for you.<p>We need IDEs to deal with ugly syntax, and we have ugly syntax cos we've always had ugly syntax, but we then use IDEs to write the ugly syntax.<p>And then I hear people deride VB, Ruby, and Python for it's lack of curly braces and parens.<p>So, I don't think IDEs are the answer. I think better syntaxes are the answer. For example, I used Textmate's easy HTML completion shortcuts for a long time. Then I found HAML, and I didn't need to close tags anymore. I use Sass, and now my CSS doesn't need ; or {} anymore.  Same with CoffeeScript.<p>C#, Java, Lisp, Perl, JavaScript are all great powerful languages, but I just get really uncomfortable hearing people defend the syntax with ""just use your IDE"". We're programmers. How come we're not interested in saying ""hey, let's fix these things!"" If the argument is ""IDEs make you more productive in language X"" then doesn't that say something about language x?<p>Just some thoughts.",1269015542

Why not teach people to respect everyone else's views no matter how vile?<p>Respect the racist's views, it makes them feel better -- who cares it if may cause them do evil.<p>Respect the scam artist's views, he feels that what he does is right.<p>etc..<p>Just because most people claim to believe in magic and fairy dust doesn't mean it's true, and if they are offended because you:<p>1. Don't believe in the same fairy dust they do\n2. Point out errors and inconsistencies in their views\n3. Behave in a way inconsistent with their views, that poses them no harm<p>Then maybe they aren't as firm in their beliefs as they thought.",1269014716

However, the comments on the article are very eye opening, providing a glimpse into the confusion and technical illiteracy with which people approach the internet. It's not just elderly folk, either, there are a lot of young people (judging from their photos) as well, putting a big, gaping hole into the myth of youngster technical competence.
