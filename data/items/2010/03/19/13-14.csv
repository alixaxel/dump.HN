I can take sick leave by simply emailing that morning and letting them know that I'm not coming in. Sick leave accumulates and is paid out when you leave the employer. The beauty of this is that there is absolutely no stigma associated with taking time off work. If you're feeling over worked then take a 'mental health' day. No one will ever question you for it or demand to see medical certificates etc.<p>On top of this of course we also have ""long service leave"", which I assume every country has. It equates to 11 weeks paid leave after working for 10 years. So basically every 10 years a teacher can look forward to around 20 weeks paid leave (if the leave is taken between Christmas and term 1 break).<p>And at $78,000/year the pay isn't bad either :)<p>Basically it's the perfect job for someone who is also working on a startup.",1269006891

Is he a liar, well I'm with Dr House (a fictional medical consultant) on that one - we all lie in some measure. Here Murdoch is spinning the standard lie equating theft (illegal) with copy infringement (tortuous) in order to enhance peoples guilt.<p>They are markedly different. Equating them is, as I rather cicuitiously said, intellectually dishonest. Theft denies a person the possession of the property, copyright infringement does not.<p>Copyright as it has been formulated, to encourage movement of works into the public domain in return for a limited monopoly, is a fantastic legal device. But the likes of Murdoch have perverted this deal - I don't deny content creators a right to profit from their work. However, the major corporations and the governments that have acceded to their demands have denied the free enjoyment of much work which should by now have entered the public domain.<p>The terms of copyright should have reduced in-line with lower cost reproduction methods but instead it has increased. If there is any theft involved in all this it is theft from the public domain.<p>Intellectual property is not really a ""new class"" of property it has been around for centuries and began precipitating into law with Queen Anne's Statute in the early 1700s. It is simply a reflection that a man should earn from the fruit of his labours whether they be physical or ethereal fruit.",1269006501

When you toss those three components together, you have the EPUB ebook format.""</i><p>I think that's just the overdetailed Wikipedia blurb transcribed into lazy-tech-journalist-ese.

Also, for those working for others (rather than selling commodities directly, as the farmers during the free silver movement)  ones paycheque does not always keep pace with inflation.<p>The rich don't keep their assets in dollars, they keep them in things like stocks and realeastate, which tends to float with inflation.<p>Inflation hits the middle/upper middle class by bumping us up in income tax brackets.  If you are fortunate enough to have skills that are in demand, you can expect your wage to rise with inflation, however, tax brackets move much more slowly, so you end up paying more in taxes.<p>As for the lower middle/lower class folks, people who aren't in high demand jobs, well, their pay quite often lags inflation by quite a lot.  (in fact, some people see this as a positive of inflation. It's very difficult to issue pay cuts to employees without major morale issues.  In inflationary times, simply not issuing raises does the same thing in an almost passive way.  Good or not, it's no fun for the worker who sees his buying power shrink.)<p>Of course, inflation hurts those on fixed incomes the most.   Who knows?  this might be our way out of the social security mess?   but yeah, it's going to suck for the people depending on that cheque.<p>So yeah, personally, I think that this idea that inflation helps the little guy is... outmoded.",1269005116
1204056,comment,1203542,1203686,0,0,_debug_,,,"> I wonder why.<p>My take on it : The level of chaos in India is extraordinary. It is ubiquitous: the traffic, the government, and the sheer number of people being the top three things that come to mind. On top of this, the justice system is defunct. In such a situation, prayer comes naturally. Faith and arbitrary belief are mechanisms to alleviate the stress and restore mental order, to lend a semblance of ""reason"" and rhyme to the working of a world that seems so arbitrary and cruel. They dull the mind but they act as an antidote against the external chaos.<p>I would guess that a sense of security and control over one's life and religiosity are anti-correlated, in any country. I would suspect that the poor, the indebted and the very ill are more likely to be religious.",1269005101

If someone wants to pass a new law and the body of law is already at the limit they'd have to push for something to be repealed first.<p>As a downside, though, this might lead to obfuscated and confusing laws as legislators try to fit as many ideas as possible into few words, rather like code with lots of three-way operators.<p>As we're all subject to all of the laws on the books, even though no one could possibly read or understand all of them, this would be a much more fair solution.<p>The Icelandic example has, in effect, a similar cap. There can be no more laws than the law-speaker can remember. Capping the size of the body of law would be more like the Icelandic example than sunset provisions.

1204031,comment,1203542,1203686,0,0,ajju,,,"IMO three things contribute to higher superstition.<p>1) People are more religious, even in the younger generation. (Having said that, it is important to note that religious != fundamentalist for most young, educated Indians. At least in my circles, religious folks will 'pay respects' to any place of worship they pass by including churches, mosques and temples of various types.)<p>2) Education in America involves a lot of critical thinking. In many classes you are specifically required to challenge an author, debate and you are encouraged to contradict the teacher. There is almost none of this in India. To me, this is something of a tragedy. I went to a small, secular school with excellent teachers (relatively speaking) and I can count on one hand the number of teachers who encouraged debate in class. It doesn't help that many 'good' schools in India are run by religious organizations like the Catholic church or religious trusts.<p>3) Until not too long ago, luck was a big factor in success in India. Opportunities were few and far between. When efforts are de-linked from rewards, I suspect many people start subscribing to superstitions.<p>Edit: I thought of one more reason: 'Respect for elders' really means 'disagreeing with elders is rude' in India. Put together with a much closer knit society, this means that your elders are going to chide you constantly for disagreeing with them, and pretty much going to take it as a personal insult. Suddenly it becomes very hard to develop independent beliefs. I was fairly lucky growing up in a family where we had all manner of debates, including on religion, but I believe that's pretty atypical.",1269003906
