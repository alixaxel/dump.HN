Yes (this is something the author totally failed to mention BTW.)<p>The benefit to going to SXSW is to see / meet people in your space. The most important part is just being there, and getting awesome introductions. The noise is totally outrageous. I don't think anyone launching a product (including us) would be able to make huge waves unless you already had nice little buzz going.<p>SXSW is amazing because everyone from SF, LA, NYC, Austin, and a million other places come together expecting to meet people.<p>One last thing - Nick posted this comment: I am part of the mid-to-high-profile blogger/media crowd; I'm entitled, but I know how shitty I sound saying that I'm entitled. We're the crowd who demands VIP access.<p>Dude you are so lame it hurts. All these parties were the same. Do you really need to get drunk and have awkward social media conversations at 3 AM?

And if you lose the netbook, it's no big deal.  $300 and you have a brand new one.)<p>The problem with the iPad and devices like it is that most of my activities in front of a computer involve typing; writing or programming.  Just sitting and reading content is nice, but that's what the Kindle is for.  And if I need to type, I need a real computer.  So the iPad is the form factor that I would like to carry around, but it's worse than a Kindle for reading and worse than a netbook for computing.<p>I also have a portable music/movie player, and a phone.

While we can't always stop the cognitive biases from occurring, we can avoid situations where they occur. For example when choosing a candidate for a job you want to make a decision before comparing with other people's opinions to avoid the bandwagon effect.<p>However some you can actually mitigate, just by knowing they happen. For example everyone has loss aversion - where we overvalue the loss of something in compared to how much we value gaining from it first place. By knowing that you have loss aversion you can focus on thinking about how much you actually gained when thinking about how much something will cost when you lose it to get a more ""real"" estimation. For example I'm giving up a business I've been running for years - it's painful to do and something I've been putting off, but I can mitigate the pain but genuinely examining what benefit I've gained, not just making the decision based on the vague ""I don't want to give this up"" feeling. It works for lots of things; relationships, jobs, etc...<p>Personally I do it mostly because I like control. I don't like not understanding my decisions.

You can bend behaviour with the odd law but not that much.  Governments have tried to stop sprawl in tons of ways but they don't have much success.    However, we can try to examine where it's going and plan what can be done within the context of what's possible to do",1268971668

Given the difficulties with measuring relative talent at that level, this is a really hard case to make.  (You could try to do it by A/B testing two different hiring processes...)<p>In fact my inclination is to believe the opposite.  People who are more excited by the culture, co-workers, and problems that Google has are generally willing to take that drop.  Which is a sign that they will fit in better here in the long run.",1268971644
