A hiring process is bad only if it leads you to hire incompetent people or -- to be more precise -- people who you later regret having hired.<p>> <i>ignoring experience by offering salaries or positions significantly below candidate's current levels in the industry.</i><p>I've heard Microsoft also does that. Though I don't know their rationale, I think it's in line with these two assumptions:<p>1) There's a large variation in skill among programmers\n2) There's no strong correlation between programming skill and years of experience<p>So while newly grads with no work experience will likely get an above average pay in those companies, more experienced people might take a pay cut.

If it's a hacked device (even something just inserted into the USB) it can type anything to our computer, issue commands, make it download stuff, sniff passwords, etc.   It takes a lot of work to make a computer secure enough that you can plug a non-trusted keyboard into it.

It would destroy liquidity, and do little to alleviate risk, since bankers would not be assured of making sufficient income to offset the cost of bad debt. Furthermore, profits from banking would be so low as to fall below the level of transfer earnings, that is to say banks and bankers might well be able to make more money doing something else and would have no incentive to operate, and the economy would go the way of North Korea (unless this system were implemented and enforced globally).<p>Since people always want money to do stuff, the demand for credit would likely be filled by illegal lenders charging usurious rates (although there's a reason I cut up all my credit cards...), and profiteering would ensue. Such illegal lenders would probably not bank their gains starving the system further of liquidity - a case of bad credit driving out good, so to speak. I imagine the likely result would be that the government would become the biggest guarantor of loans and cronyism and other kinds of corruption would become endemic. Doubtless you don't intend for this outcome, but I can't help feeling your proposal would rapidly result in a soviet-style economy, which I can attest from first-hand experience does not work very well.<p>Incidentally, not only is it illegal for an individual to lend money that does not exist, it is illegal for them to lend more than a certain sum of their <i>own</i> money at interest, I believe under the same laws that require investor accreditation.",1268968844

I now do the ""creating new stuff"" for myself at my startup.<p><i>If the talent is trying to make itself irreplaceable - like say, only one person knows how something works and they do not like documenting it or training others. It shows insecurity of the person who does not want to lose the job, which is bad for the organization as well as for the person.<p>Bad for the organization because, if the person either wants to quit or cannot turn up for work, a crucial piece of work cannot be completed.<p>Bad for the person because, though the person might think he/she is crucial for something work and cannot be fired, they are making themselves tied up to the work and hence cannot be promoted to better opportunities.<p>A talent should learn and grow. And then to teach others and make them grow. And keep repeating the process. If there is not much you can learn to grow, then quit and join some place where you can.</i><p>This is from my first link to HN (545 days ago)..\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=309262"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=309262</a>",1268968196

If I was more risk oriented I would have probably made out much better than I have, but whenever something works I become ultra conservative about it.<p>Investing in other peoples ventures is one of the ways in which I try to cure myself of that, it's been slow going and my 'batting average' so far is not fantastic but it still works for me.<p>It splits the 'fight to go back' from the 'fight to go forward', I literally write off the investment the moment it's done and from there it can only go 'up', not drag me back.<p>And it gives someone else a chance to fight their way out of whatever hole they're in.",1268967727
