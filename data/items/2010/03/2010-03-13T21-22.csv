It's just a different market. You earn more money and spend more money, but on average it's the same proportion.

- ""Rentacoder does not have skilled developers from western countries. What it has are freelancers from countries like Romania, India, Pakistan and Russia.""<p>Nope. It has developers from all over(I live in Lebanon). Freelance programmers are simply programmers that don't work exclusively for one client.

Roughly 8 months into it, i was working with start ups and people were contacting me directly even though my rates are not the cheapest.<p>I no longer look for gigs on RAC, but its certainly a viable lively hood if you're picky with the projects you take on.

I am completely behind the ""Look at this site I made"", but the ""in X hours"" part confuses me.<p>1) Persistance is one of the most important traits for an entrepreneur.  We're in an ADD society, and things do not happen overnight.  It's easy to throw together a website, but it's more difficult to stick with it, refine it, get people using it, and most importantly, get them paying for it.  These posts often strike me as demonstrating ADD, moreso than anything else.<p>2) It feels like misplaced gloating.  I think it's great that you're smart, entrepreneurial, and able to create prototypes quickly.  But it's really not worth gloating about how fast you can put up a prototype, most people on this message board could do the same if they weren't working on their real ventures. If you absolutely insist on gloating, it would be better to do so about how many millions of users you have, how many millions of dollars you made, or how many days you were able spent on a beach last year.  If your weekend project can achieve high marks in any of those categories, then I'd definitely want to hear about it.<p>3) Is it an attempt to demonstrate intelligence/ability?  In today's programming landscape, there are so many automated libraries and frameworks that it's pretty easy to put almost anything together (want to put up a site that links satellite images, recent macroeconomic trends, and real time XYZ events, no problem).  Combining some subset of available frameworks and libraries doesn't demonstrate intelligence or ability, even if you can do it in a weekend.<p>4) If it is really that brilliant of an idea, don't rush it.  Go in stealth most for at least an additional weekend, and thoroughly plot out how you'll turn this into a feasible product.<p>5) Is it an attempt to demonstrate how entrepreneurial you are?  A better way to do that would be to pick one random idea, have the confidence that it's so good that you are willing to commit yourself to it 100%, pursue it regardless of what other people are telling you, and make it work.<p>6) Is it an attempt to get into YC? If this works, then maybe I'd understand it more.  There seems to have been more of these over the past few weeks, so maybe that's what's going on.  Although, it seems to me to make you appear more ADD than entrepreneurial.<p>I'm completely behind your entrepreneurial aspirations, but I'd rather you really commit yourself to something, work out the kinks, get users using it, then post ""Look at my startup"".  Then I can have faith that you've really thought it through, and it's more worth HN's time to really understand what it is you're trying to do so that we can make some valuable recommendations or questions.",1268516403

1189679,comment,1188917,1188917,0,0,megaduck,,,"We've been here before.<p>After the implosion of the Japanese asset bubble in the early 1990s, Japan set effectively 0% interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy.  This led to what's known as a 'carry trade', where investors would borrow free money from Japan, and then invest it in higher-yield investments abroad.<p>After the collapse of the American equity markets in 2001, higher yields were hard to come by.  So, all that liquidity went looking for a new home and largely landed in mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, and their associated derivatives.  Of course, a lot of these investments yielded only a few percent, so investment funds would often leverage up 20x-30x to get a respectable rate of return.<p>When those investments started to unwind, they unwound <i>hard</i>.  The end result was that the Japanese carry trade contributed to the eventual devastation of the American financial system.  Which, ironically, means that we now have 0% interest rates.  The great cycle continues.<p>Now, the Japanese carry trade certainly isn't the whole story, and there's a lot of other factors that were in play.  However, there's no doubt in my mind that the BOJ's 0% interest rates helped us dig the hole that we find ourselves in today.",1268516384

That's a marketplace estimated at 10 Million users, and only a few hundred thousand are actually buying anything. In fact, android users buy about $1 on average of apps per month, while iPhone/iPod Touch users spend about $5 a month, and that's an ecosystem with fast-approaching 100 Million users hungry (and more importantly, willing to pay) for content.
