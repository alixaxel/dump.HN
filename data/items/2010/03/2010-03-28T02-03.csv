1224132,comment,1224071,1224128,0,0,astine,,,"I'm with Fowler on this one as well. If you divide out parts of the logic of a single complex function, you can take it one level at a time. Furthermore, if you've divided it well, you can more easily reuse logic. Having a single monolithic function is like having a single monolithic program: usually a bad idea.<p>Granted, I don't like spreading related logic over several files, but that is Java's fault.",1269745195

Nowadays, almost all relational databases (except, of course, MySQL) support XML columns.

1224122,comment,1222956,1223017,0,0,csomar,,,"> Say what you like about colonialism, but this kind of shit never happened under the British Empire. They'd come in, kill the local armies and resistance, then they'd start building roads, hospitals, and schools and generally managing their territories fairly well.<p>If they are coming for good, why do they kill the resistance and the local armies? If you are going to offer free services that benefit us, why do you need armed soldiers? You Don't! If you want to make use of our resources for our benefit, so that won't really be a matter for 99% of the population, they'll be happy.
Point two: Resistance didn't exist before colonialism, it appeared after and it was a result of colonialism.<p>Question: British contributed in the Iraq War. What was the result? Roads, schools, hospitals? No, but hundred of thousands of deaths under the US and British army, more violence than ever and a corrupt political system.",1269744552

""<p>Huh?  If indicators are used to prove life is worse off now in Africa say, then of course indicators can be used to prove life is better now in India. Besides, I used  ""indicators"" for life 9 years after the British left. Penicillin doesn't account for  dams and roads and schools and hospitals and no more famines (for example).<p>Besides, I was explicitly countering lionhearted's (original) claim that India had <i>devolved</i> from colonial rule, an assertion for which there was  (and can be) zero evidence provided, but  a lot of people here accepted and voted it up. So it seems ""colonialism was a good thing"" is a popular idea among people who were never colonized.

I'll just say that the British were probably better than the other colonizing powers. (The french had a presence in some parts of India for a while and were no worse than the British, but Germans or Belgians would have been worse I guess.

The codebase is rather volatile (coming back to it after a few months required a lot of extra work) and the documentation right now is definitely poor.<p>That said, I think Chef has a lot of potential. It's just waiting for a solution that brings it all together. I'm highly looking forward to the upcoming opscode-managed Chef server. I'd like to see something like Heroku, where deployment is simple and easy, but is based on community-provided recipes (instead of Heroku-provided addons) and is closer to a fixed monthly cost (to provide the chef server) instead of a per-server-resource cost (dynos).<p>As for the article, as other haves stated, it largely talks about how Puppet is more established. The only points that matter to me are #3 and #9. #3 seems to be a direct result of Chef's entry into the market and the value of #9 seems arguable.<p>So, to summarize:<p>* Puppet is definitely more established and better documented<p>* Chef is not there yet, but has (in my opinion) more potential for the future",1269742440
