Audiobooks - I subscribe to Audible.com and get books audiobooks from library and occasionally Librivox. I listen on my 20 minute commute, while I exercise, and when I'm doing mundane tasks like the dishes or cleaning.<p>2. eBooks - I put the icons for Stanza and GoodReader on the homescreen of my iPhone. When I find myself about to tap a game or feed reader or YouTube or whatever I check myself and ask myself if I'm in a good state to read (e.g. awake enough, have more than 3 minutes). I don't feel like I'm denying myself the entertainment of another game of Doodle Jump as much as consciously encouraging myself to opt for something that I generally find to be more satisfying.<p>3. Books by the bed. Nothing new there. I sometimes squeeze in a little time to read real, paper books before bedtime or when I wake up.<p>I haven't turned down the thermostat, alienated people, ordered stacks of library books or blocked any blogs (though I have drastically reduced the number of blogs I subscribe to).

At that point, a supportive and cushioning shoe would be less stressful than barefoot running.</i><p>I am not sure this is true at all. Yes, it is really hard to toe-step if you lack the muscle to support yourself, even though exercise will eventually strengthen you enough, but to go from that to asserting that heel-stepping is therefore better is a stretch. I would imagine that weight sufficient to force me on my heels would be highly destructive on joints (<i>hence all such problems obese people face.</i>) If you consider such weight pushed down on an unstable surface - which is what a cushioned shoe is - without the necessary ligament- or muscular control to maintain posture, the leg is virtually guaranteed to be constantly misaligned.",1267559559

The complexity is still there. It's just well hidden under intuitiveness. But the important thing is that os x didn't get there simply by having less features. Stripping away things doesn't always help make it better. Consider a video encoding tool. You could make the software easier to use by making it a file picker and a encode button. But this easier is relative to the user. You're definitely sacrifing some power. But if you hide advanced controls you can simplify th ui but removing often unused controls while keeping power features like codec selection available. But it's not just about simplifying by removing any and all features that a single group finds unecessary. It depends in your users. Ideally, all the power with all the simplicity.",1267558818

The sales prof's tell you to segment, segment, segment. Get a target market and focus on it like a laser. Classic Crossing the Chasm type stuff -- b/c the idea is that one segment will exponentially grow because of network effects. i.e., focusing on one market segment enables you to build up a brand and product awareness in that niche. People in that niche talk amongst themselves and then you get more market share b/c they refer each other to your service. Contrast this with the approach of focusing a little bit on a variety of segments. You never build up enough critical mass in one segment; consequently, you get less return on your investment of time and energy, and, overall, less total market share. This, in a nutshell, is the segment, segment, segment approach.<p>Contrast this with what I call the 'agnostic platform' approach. There is likely a better term for it, I'm just not aware of it. Build an awesome product that appeals to everyone. Have your marketing messages clearly spell out the features, advantages, and benefits of the product, but don't segment. e.g., think of some of the successful companies that have done great in the recent past (Twitter, Scribd, YouTube etc.) These companies (at least from what I can tell) didn't segment early on. Facebook, on the other hand, did. They were clearly focused on colleges from the very beginning, and Ivy league colleges in particular.<p>Finally, the approach we are taking is the BOTH approach. We are building an agnostic platform, but going after specific market segments at the same time.<p>Any thoughts on which approach is the best? Why? Any helpful experiences/tips in increasing adoption on an open/agnostic platform? I've asked these same questions to MBA profs and others. Most of their knowledge seems tied to traditional sales processes. In their minds, it seems the jury is still out on which approach is the best. I get the impression that they think the both approach is fine, but that we'd be better off if we instead segment, segment, segment.<p>Hopefully this discussion will help others out who are also in the process of nailing down their adoption/sales strategies.",1267557695

And some who are gregarious find that it is a tendency that interferes with their goals.<p>The pressure for people to be gregarious is intense, though, and it is harder for those who aren't natural social butterflies. The natural tendency might be for someone to soak up an enormous amount of time reading. Because of the pressure to constantly be socially on-call, they have to make the choice seem much more deliberate. As a result come off as someone with an anti-social disorder. The result would be the same, but because we brand the end as less than desirable, they get cursed for their means. Either way, they get patronized, which simply isn't conducive to anything but antagonism.<p>This may not be the thought pattern aaronsw is following; I don't know. He might be actively fighting a natural extroversion because his goals don't align with his extroverted nature. I'm rather strongly introverted as a natural tendency. He may make a deliberate choice, while I drift, but am forced to make it seem at times a deliberate choice. Same ends, different means.<p>Nevertheless, the net you cast to catch him caught me as well. I suspect I have much more to understand about the naturally gregarious frame of mind, and would enjoy a discussion toward understanding.

1162231,comment,1160993,1161829,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"I think there is a deeper unreasonableness. What would a truly scientific hiring process look like? What might a large organisation, such as the British Civil Service do to make sure that it hires the right people?<p>One idea is to score candidates on many measures (100?) and make use guessed weights to guide initial hiring decisions. A decade later the organisation can compare the initial assessments against the hires subsequent progress up the organisation. This leads to a re-assessment of the weights.<p>Notice that the new weights were computed from the poputation of hires, not the population of candidates, and the hires were chosen using the old weights. The new weights are causing the organisation to hire people that it would have rejected in the past and it has no solid data on how those people would have performed in the organisation - it didn't hire them! There are other problems. The whole approach has too many parameters to calibrate it reliably from the data available. The linearity implicit in a weighted sum is implausible, a more sophisticated model with the number of variables squared or cubed is clearly required. The time scale on which the success of the hiring decisions becomes apparent is long, decades. It is the time scale on which things change. So the new scientific weights might be no better than rebooting the whole process with new, guessed weights.<p>My point is that organisations don't have substantial reasons for their hiring decisions. They have a process because they are forced to chose, and they consequently have procedural reasons for their hiring decisions.<p>A small organisation, such as Fog Creek, that has scientifically trained personnel, may be well aware that it hires the wrong people. Those in charge know that they hire the wrong people and that they cannot fix the problem. They also know that business is competitive, they only have to do better than their competitors, and since the problem is pretty much impossible, their competitors cannot fix it either.<p>The serious answer to the hiring question is ""We don't know how to chose. We make wild guesses and then pretend that we have good reasons for them so that we don't feel too bad afterwards. The whole topic is really embarrassing. You shouldn't have asked.""",1267557161

Given that their goal is to sell product, process foods are designed to have texture that rapidly breaks down into easily swallowed mush.<p>Here is an experiment.  Get a some chicken and cook it yourself.  (If you need an easy recipe, try <a href=""http://www.recipefiles.org/view_recipe.php?id=551"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.recipefiles.org/view_recipe.php?id=551</a> - my kids love it.)  Buy some pre-cooked chicken from a fast food restaurant like KFC.  Attempt to eat pieces of both chickens.  You generally will need to chew the chicken you prepare yourself about twice as much before swallowing.  The reason is that the preparation for the fast food chicken involves breaking down all of the internal texture of the chicken while injecting a mix of sugar, fat, salt and water to plump it up and make it more tasty.<p>If you want to look at this another way, stop looking at processed food as food.  Look at it as a drug delivery system.  The drug is a combination of sugar, fat and salt, and easy administration of the drug is an explicit design goal.",1267556953

1162219,comment,1161743,1161743,0,0,raganwald,,,"One of the more interesting games I've seen is coöperative poker solitaire. In poker solitaire, you are dealt 25 cards and lay them out in a 5x5 grid. You try to make the best possible poker hands. The general scoring works by trying to make the bets possible hands working down from a royal flush. So if you have the cards for a royal flush, you have to make that. If you have the cards for a lesser straight flush in the same suit but can't make the royal flush, you don't have to make the lesser straight flush.<p>Anyhow, the really interesting game is a coöperative two player variant. Thirteen cards are dealt to one player, twelve to another. Players cannot see each other's cards. The player with thirteen places a card on the table, then turns alternate. Once played, cards cannot be moved. At the conclusion of the game, the cards must be arranged in a 5x5 grid. So technically the first two cards could have three blank spaces between them diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.<p>Pairs cannot communicate via any means other than the cards they choose to play. So to play well, pairs generally work out a system for signaling what they have, i.e. opening with a strong card and so forth.",1267556848
