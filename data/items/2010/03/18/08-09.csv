Talk about exaggeration.<p>Yes, for <i>some</i> people Hitler had some virtues (as they do Genghis Khan,  Mao Tse Tung, Stalin, Che, Lenin, George W Bush) which <i>they think</i> are worthy of being admired.<p>"" I guess the story with the name Osama in Muslim cultures is similar.""<p>You are wrong.<p>There is a rise in babies being named Osama <i>after</i> 9/11. I thought that was obvious from the context. Sorry if I was  not clear enough.  Arab and Pakistani teenagers wear T shirts with Osama's picture on them. There are large numbers of people who think Osama Bin Laden is a heroic figure. You (and I) think he is a homicidal maniac. Other people don't.<p>You can always find <i>some</i> people somewhere who admire the mass murderers of history (including Osama, Mao , Stalin and  the British who created concentration camps in the first place), as compared to those whose ancestors were massacred. It doesn't mean much.<p>Germans expecting all Pakistanis to hate and abhor Hitler as much as they do is like some Pakistanis expecting them to love Osama Bin Laden.<p>So yes the world doesn't always have prejudices in lockstep with your own, and sometimes admire people you abhor and vice versa.

As a German, who as a matter of fact doesn't feel particularly guilty about things his great-grandfathers did half a century before he was born, I'd like to know how you come to such a peculiar opinion. Evil is less evil if you can blame someone else? It's okay to revere mass murderers as long as you're not the one who let them come into power?<p>Your point about children's names is almost the textbook definition of a straw man, and I think you know it. Many German children are named Joseph, but that name has a long cultural and religious history, and no one in their right mind would associate that with Stalin. I guess the story with the name Osama in Muslim cultures is similar. However, if Pakistani parents name their children Adolf, a name that has no cultural associations in Pakistan whatsoever except being linked to a brutal mass murderer, then that's at least a little bit cringe worthy.<p>(I wonder if Godwin's Law applies to a discussion that's already about Hitler in the first place, and if a factual discussion about such a topic is even possible...)",1268902292

1200794,comment,1200389,1200748,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"<i>Last time i checked there a lot of video services out there with subscription/premium service.</i><p>Vimeo doesn't charge to <i>watch</i> videos, so far as I know, and that's what triggers the licensing exemption.<p><i>But think about it, what will happen then? MS will support wmv by default, Apple will support Quicktime by default, Mozilla theora.</i><p>If HTML5 were to mandate Theora support, that part of the spec would simply be ignored by browser vendors who don't want to support Theora. Thus the mandate or lack of mandate in the spec produces no practical difference whatsoever in the end result: Apple's browsers would do H.264, Mozilla's browsers would do Theora, etc., etc.<p><i>But on a phone?</i><p>Again, it seems unlikely that anyone other than Mozilla will bother with Theora on mobile devices. Apple and Nokia have already taken pretty clear stances against supporting Theora, for example, so what good would it do to put a mandate in the spec? It'll just be ignored.<p><i>As i told you, this is not technical, it's political.</i><p>You seem to have a misunderstanding of how web standards actually work; without buy-in from the companies which will implement them, the standards might as well not exist at all. That's why HTML5 currently doesn't mandate a video codec; originally it required Theora support, but several major players basically said ""if you leave that in there we're just going to ignore it"".<p>Since this is a recurring problem with what you seem to be saying, what's your solution? Any approach to video codecs must take into account the fact that browser vendors can't be forced to ship an implementation of any particular codec, and will make their own decisions independently of what you might like them to do. As far as I can see right now, delegating to the operating system's media framework is the only way to get the sort of broad support that's needed, since those frameworks have to ship with a wide range of codecs already.<p>(and, honestly, the manual codec install really only turns out to be an issue with Theora; Windows and OS X both ship pretty much everything else out of the box)",1268901529

Most people have read it, and most think it is a turgid bit of prose.<p>(2) Why should Indians (or Pakistanis for that matter) have the same level of Hitler Phobia and/or Holocaust guilt Germans have? I thought the German ""guilt"" was all about how Hitler and co misled  <i>their ancestors</i> into The Holocaust and other dirty deeds. Indians and Pakistanis were colonized by the British at the time of WW2 and many of our ancestors fought against the Nazis and the Japanese. (Some of them fought <i>for</i> the Nazis/Japanese trying to attain independence for India from the British).<p>Nutshell: People who had nothing to do with the Nazis or the Holocaust and for whom the Nazis and Hitler were ""people far away"" fighting and winning aginst an oppressive colonial power don't have as much of a bad reaction as people who were invaded/ruled/slaughtered  by them.<p>Big Deal.<p>Genghis Khan built mountains of skulls during his invasions but would Germans blanch if they saw a Muslim with the name ""Genghis"" or ""Timur"" or think his name  is inappropriate?<p>As something to chew on, many babies born in the Middle East / Pakistan etc are being named ""Osama"". An <i>American</i> child with such a name would find social situations  difficult I imagine. No such stigma in Pakistan. At some point will we see a headline ""Saudis cringe at Osama's popularity in Pakistan""?<p>To be even more controversial it could be argued that Bush and co ""killed a million Iraqis"" for no real purpose. Should all Americans hate and abhor W? Stalin and Mao were responsible for more deaths than Hitler Should Chinese be  surprised that some few Americans think Mao  was ""cool""?<p>fwiw I personally thing Hitler was a charismatic and thoroughly evil person. Most Indians who are aware of actual history feel the same way.<p>But I am also aware concentration camps were ""invented"" by the British during the Boer War and the large scale deaths of non combatant Boer women and children in these camps could be called genocide if it happened today.

Apple having a few patents in the pool just makes a janitorial-sized line-item in their budget even cheaper since they get payments back too. Apple has paid to license a suite of codecs for every install since the dawn of Quicktime (though they charged $20 for an MPEG2 <i>encoder</i> for a long time), supporting h.264 <video> costs them nothing — they already paid a nickel for your iTunes install.<p>Dirac is terrific, but it'll be another few years before it's ready; and it'll be much longer before the available bandwidth and demand for quality exists — it'll pick up among people pirating 1080p video, but it doesn't scale down enough for the youtubes of the world.<p>QuickTime is not a codec and never has been, it's a container, which happens to have been standardized as the MPEG4 container, because it doesn't suck ass like everything else (save Matroska). WMV is mostly a container too — they had a good 'proprietary' WMV codec called VC-1, but they got pwned with submarine patents after they lobbied it into the HD standards war.",1268899441
