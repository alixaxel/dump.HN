These are actually pretty easy to solve, but one thing always stands in the way: big, corrupt government.  \nSo, how would we fix that using games? well, notice that the governments run on the labor/consumption of their people.  Since lots of people have already 'escaped' to virtual worlds due to the addictiveness of the games and/or the economic depression occuring in real life, governments are able to steal less and less from their people, thus they have to get smaller (or print more money/hike up tax, which pressures people to withdrawal).

It is from a very different view point than what I usually hear. My needle is new, but I have been selling them for over two years, on line, in some stores and at state fairs and events. There is a huge market for them. A needle is the most ubiquious of tool in the world. It is used in surgery, to mending, crafts, to fishing. The design I came up with has a very precarious geometry to keep the thread inside and not snag the material you are sewing. The technology to make it did not exist fifty years ago. I also have just been written up in a newspaper in Denmark and my website sales have gone through the roof. Maybe the Danes sew more than the Americans.",1268956442

He bit off more than he could chew, though. If he hadn't allied with Japan and made a few strategic decisions better than he had, Germany would still have most of Europe today. That's not my point, though. My point is that, had Hitler been a successful conquerer, he wouldn't be nearly as hated as he is. Maybe that success would have involved slightly less ambition (but the same amount of genocide). As far as the brutality and genocide go, the main difference is that Hitler was so damned <i>good</i> at it. If you want to kill off 10 million people, it's far more cost-effective to enslave them and work them to death, isn't it?<p>On the other hand, consider the white domination of North America. The Indians were set against one another in various wars. If a tribe or band was defeated they were either exterminated or forcibly relocated to reservations. Treaties were repeatedly signed and broken--if we relocated a group of Indians to a piece of land that ended up being valuable, we relocated them again. We weren't organized enough to set up concentration camps, but we had enough room we could give them parcels of worthless land for reservations. If we didn't enslave them directly, we bought slaves from Indian slavers, which only led them to more warfare, so the winners could sell the losers as slaves. Incidentally, this is also how white people ruined West Africa.<p>Once white people achieved their ""manifest destiny"" over North America, they really didn't seem to care too much about all the genocide and mass murder and racism involved. Even today, a lot of them don't.<p>Incidentally, the German people turned against Hitler as soon as he started losing. I don't know that they really cared much about the genocide yet, but they were mad at Hitler because it was Hitler's fault that allied bombs were landing on their houses. If Hitler won, no one would have really questioned or cared what he did to get there, or why there was suddenly so much room in what used to be Eastern Europe for them to move out into.<p>""Hitler was no rational politician - he was a racist and mass murderer.""<p>You keep acting like this is any kind of unique distinction among imperialists and conquerers throughout history.",1268954194

Also this pretends to be a reproduction of the milgram experiment, while the conditions are very different. Obeying to a show hostess and obeying to a doctor isn't the same thing, and shouldn't be analyzed as being the same.<p>- Going further in my first point, while this is supposed to be scientific, it obviously is not. But even the motivations of the show are unclear. Supposedly it's there to warn us about the dangerous power of television, while it's actually obvious that the show is using the very mechanisms it's supposed to denounce. People act shocked while they satisfy those very appetites of violence and voyeurism. How clever.<p>BTW I'm french, and watched a few extracts of the show, but i didn't have the occasion to watch it in full. It looks very fakeish, and very disturbing too. I guess the minimum the show director could do is display some proofs of the veracity of the show.<p>Sociology, and human sciences in general, ought to be something serious, in the process and in the display.
