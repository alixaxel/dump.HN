Whistle the tune and people think of A. Later artist B creates a derived work, perhaps B orchestrates it or adds words. For example Gounod's Ave Maria based on the Prelude I from Bach's 48 Preludes and Fugues. It gets more interested if B moves things along in a big way.<p>For a while the new version eclipses the old. But has B borrowed A's work, or stolen it? Time passes. Time's cruel erosion of reputation wears down both A and B. Eventually only one is widely remembered. If it is A that is remembered, the cognoscente think that B was the lesser artist who metaphorically borrowed A's work. If it is B that is remembered, the cognoscente think that B was the great artist, who metaphorically stole A's work.<p>Borrow/Steal is the verdict of history, choosing to remember a single artist.

1165615,comment,1165471,1165542,0,0,nostrademons,,,"""I know patents cause trouble, but what about the case where a patent helps an entrepreneur get the value out of an invention when big corporations steal it, market it, and make money without giving the inventor a dime?""<p>Patents don't protect against that.  Problem is, filing a patent takes time, money, and attention that are in very short supply in a startup.  You can file to protect your inventions - but if you do, that takes time away from more important things like getting the money you need to stay in business.  And patents generally need to be filed <i>before</i> the invention becomes public (you have a year grace period in the U.S, but no such boon in the EU).  If you gate your launch process on the speed of the patent process, you won't be launching much.<p>That's why Google's first patent wasn't filed until 2003 (<a href=""http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6526440"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6526440</a> - the PageRank patent is actually owned by Stanford, since they were Page & Brin's employers when it was invented).  And many of the initial EBay inventions - online auctions and reputation, for example - were never patented, because the 1 year grace period had expired by the time they got around to it.  Patents are something you get once you become big and have extra money lying around, not something you can afford as a startup.",1267660249

That problem exists outside the world of patents and software. Monsanto patents seeds and those are just strings of DNA which are essentially just <i>four</i> characters repeated in a seemingly random order.  And yet farmers lose their farms over those strings of four letters. Not because they were even choosing to use the seeds, corn is just pollinated by the air and some of that code got into their crop as it blew in from the neighbors' field -- a farmer who <i>did</i> use Monsanto's DNA.  It's absurd, I know.<p>One case on the not absurd side of the spectrum, is, as it turns out, the original case that ruled software could be patented in the first place.  It was by a guy who had to fight, iirc, all the way to the supreme court to protect his right to patent his software invention.  I'll try to find a link, but is a true story indeed.",1267660004

Mark seems like he's really making an effort to be a ""product"" person, which open source could use more of. Bravo!  (And this has always been reflected in Ubuntu, which I really appreciate.)<p>Some nits: The new font is a step backward. The softness of the old font was both distinct, unique, AND comfortable.  The new one is not as unique. And I don't think will age so well. (Plus, fonts and logos are not something that need an overhaul as often as themes and campaigns. I just think it was maybe too soon to overhaul the font. It was a strong brand.)<p>I LOVE the new colors. Yeah, there's an Apple overlap, but I don't think ""APPLE!"" as soon as I see it.<p>Window controls on the left: I don't like it. I have desktops on all three major OS's, so it's not because I'm trained for one way or the other.  There's just something that feels better about them being on the right.<p>Overall: I'm giving it all a chance, and will jump in with both feet when it's released, without undoing the major changes.\nThe main point here is: They really care and have a vision.  Whenever somebody makes a tool/OS/webapp/meal with a really specific vision, i always give it the benefit of the doubt, and try it THEIR way, not bending to my preferences or instinct to add salt/take off the tomato/go to my favorite theme/etc.  When I don't try stuff with that trust, i often miss out.  I hope Linux users give it a fair shot, even if stuff feels funny at first.",1267657337
