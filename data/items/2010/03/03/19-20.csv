I don't like a lot of games that are popular.<p>Chinese poker isn't very popular really, you'd be hard pressed to find a casino that spreads it. I played it a decent amount when I was playing poker for a living, but it was more like 4 guys just found an open table and played.<p>Blackjack's easy because the dealer can play like an automaton, and the game moves really, really fast. If your game could have a dealer algorithm (like Pai Gow) you might be able to sell it as a table game. Breaking into that is extremely hard though.",1267642824

As far as I can tell there is one man in the entire world who works on stable distributions (like normal distributions, but with tunable skew and heavy-tailedness parameters), which have been quite useful for me.  If you have or believe you have data that has subtle dependencies among the random variables, you <i>could</i> use a copula but multivariate Archimedian copulas are hard to compute with (far as we've been able to tell, at least), copula fitting is a research problem, and copula choice is black magic.",1267642816
