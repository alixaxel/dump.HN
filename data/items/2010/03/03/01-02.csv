Fog Creek has a policy of not divulging their reasons for denying an applicant a certain position. Joel has given his arguments about why that is sound, so I will not bother to repeat them. You keep assuming that Fog Creek should know that it would be safe to make an exception in your case and getting offended that they choose not to. The fact is you should not be an exception.<p>To make this as clear as possible, suppose you were trying to get pain killers without a prescription.

I don't think I agree with this example, though:<p><i>He might, for example, ask students to recite the letters A through J as fast as possible, and then the numbers 1 through 10. Each of those tasks typically takes around two seconds. Then he asks them to interweave the two recitations as fast as they can: ""A, 1, B, 2,"" and so on. Does that take four seconds? No, it typically requires 15 to 20 seconds, and even then many students make mistakes.</i><p>That's not a fair comparison. When I quickly recite the numbers from 1-10, I'm not figuring out which number comes next each time, I'm reciting an incredibly well-rehearsed script I have memorized. Same with the letters.<p>I <i>could</i> memorize the sequence A-1-B-2-... Then I bet I would be able to recite it in 4 seconds.<p>To better capture the ""switching time"" that purports to demonstrate, you'd need to interleave two tasks which each require that kind of ""next step"" generation. e.g. Time someone giving every other letter and the square numbers, for instance.<p>It's pretty easy to determine the sequence for each of those, and it's unlikely that someone's memorized the whole thing already.",1267580794

This way they relate their problem solving and the solutions they find. For example when they decide that their program needs to write a file, they go and look for information on how to write a file, take it and implement it in their program. Conversely someone who goes through a tutorial of how to write a file does not have the situational reference to call upon to remember that accomplishment. I have found that individuals who learn programming via tutorials general do so through a good deal of repetition.<p>I have taught two people to program from scratch and I did so with both by finding a project that they wanted to do.
