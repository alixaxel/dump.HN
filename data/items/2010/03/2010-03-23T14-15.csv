1213040,comment,1212788,1212788,0,0,Frazzydee,,,"> China’s biggest cellular communications company, China Mobile, was expected to cancel a deal that had placed Google’s search engine on its mobile Internet home page<p>> China’s second-largest mobile company, China Unicom, was said by analysts and others to have delayed or killed the imminent introduction of a cellphone based on Google’s Android platform.<p>> One major Internet portal, Tom.com, already had ceased using Google to power its search engine.<p>Now, I'm not sure of the business arrangements made, but it sounds to me that Chinese companies are repudiating contracts because of pressure by the Chinese government.<p>If true, this looks really bad on China for foreign investment.  The government can, on a whim, cancel your contracts with Chinese companies, and steer public opinion using news agencies.  Not to mention risk of your IP getting appropriated.  That's not the kind of environment foreign companies like to work in.<p>The Chinese government is, I think, looking very childish right now.",1269356379

It only took about twenty minutes.  During this phase I ate lightly - small bowl of cereal every morning, dry garden salad at lunch, mid-sized dinner.  Drank mostly water and black coffee (a few cups a day) with rare exceptions.  I was heavily informed by BripBlap's ""101 Thoughts on Losing 100 Pounds"" here. [1]<p><i>Muscle building phase</i><p>For the second phase I added more protein to my diet and started exercising regularly: 3-4 bodyweight strength exercises on Monday/Wednesday/Friday with walking or tabata squats for cardio on off days. [2] The bodyweight exercises  (and the walking for that matter) were key to helping me stick with the workout regimen.  I could pull it off without needing to commute to a gym and often I didn't even have to shower afterwards so I was able to pull off a 15-20 minute low-intensity strength workout during work hours.  The hokey-looking ""King's Court"" exercises peddled by Matt Furey helped me out here. [3] I also purchased a $20 pullup bar that I installed in my home to add a fourth bodyweight strength exercise to the King's Court.<p><i>Maintenance phase</i><p>Here is where I've rather screwed it up.  I got overzealous about the strength conditioning and began eating more and more to cover the calorie / protein debt I was building up by doing so many pullups, pushups, and squats.  I had visions of huge muscles!  Unfortunately I came through the holidays in 2009 with a larger diet and a steadily shrinking exercise regimen.  I'm now up to 190 pounds, walking a few miles a week, and only able to do 3-4 pullups in a single set.  I'm resetting my goals now and just aiming to keep my weight down with a little bit of strength work where I can fit it in.  I'd love to be chiseled but I am not quite able to give up the simplicity of my earlier diet and low-impact workout phases.<p>// Edited to add the grim realities of the maintenance phase //<p>Bottom line: At age 27 I dropped from 220 pounds to 175 and I built up from 0 pullups and 5 pushups to 40 pullups a day and 30 pushups a day without a gym or a complicated diet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bripblap.com/2007/101-thoughts-on-losing-100-pounds/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bripblap.com/2007/101-thoughts-on-losing-100-poun...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nRgSFShqOU&feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nRgSFShqOU&feature=relat...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.cbass.com/Furey.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbass.com/Furey.htm</a>",1269354032

A small horizontal movement, or effectively unlimited vertical, does work on most methods I've seen (though horizontal is arguably more important).  However, as the phone seems to allow 3D in both orientations, it probably can't handle either direction's angle changes very well.<p>Personally, I like head-tracking better than limited camera angle, primarily because it lets you look ""behind"" things by changing your viewing angle.  Stereoscopic 3D alone doesn't allow that, because you're looking at a fixed image with depth.  It's also cheaper to render the image, because you don't need to do it twice (or more, if you want to allow additional viewing angles).<p>I'm actually <i>really</i> surprised I haven't seen fairly frequent head-tracking for the current generation of consoles, imagine how well that would sell for single-player games, even if it's only subtle shifts (which are all you need to get a 3D feel).
