Many people in that third category care about making money in an abstract sense -- it's a game, but it can be a long-term game. They don't care about the cars or the status symbols. They love building wealth, but not for wealth's sake.<p>People who don't understand long-term relationships are not actually in the long-term game to make money. Usually they just lack some emotional intelligence. People who 'get it' develop good, long-term business relationships, because they know that to be a successful businessperson and make lots of money you can't just rely on short-term contract-type thinking.

You don't have enough to ""change the world"" but working is almost pointless etc.</i><p>I'm sorry to hear about your friend, but if you ask me, the ""almost pointless"" excuse is pretty pathetic.<p>All else equal, being rich gives you strictly <i>more</i> options, and therefore the means to make work <i>more</i> meaningful. At $6m net worth, you own your own time and can work or play at will, in pretty much any industry you desire. Also, your career is going to be much better if you're rich because 1) upper management assumes you work hard because you actually <i>want</i> to do so rather than have to, 2) you get better jobs and projects because people want to buy your family's connections, and 3) most importantly, you don't have the ""fear of the boss"" that middle-class people do, so upper management sees you as more independent and confident. I've worked on Wall Street at desks that send more money across the table every day than most rich kids' trust funds, and even there, rich kids advance faster, primarily for reason #3.<p>In the for-profit sector, working is <i>actually</i> pointless for 90+% of people in it, who will never appreciably advance and only go to work because they have to. Being unusually talented or wealthy gives one a chance to not be caught in that trap and to do ""pointful"" work. So I don't buy into the bullshit excuse that his trust fund made working ""almost pointless"". Not in the least.",1269370000

Phone's running Symbian, WinMo, BB-OS, Palm, etc. have been allowing the user to run apps without a nanny/gatekeeper for ages with no ill effects.

Is it O.K. if the RIAA decides that ""to control the user experience"" you're not allowed to rip CD's to your iPod? And of course, there is the easy counterexample that allowing users to freely choose their applications (that whole free market thing) hasn't seemed to have hurt the legendary user experience of OSX.<p>What particularly bothers me is the combination of the strict restrictions in the iPhone App store and the App store being the <i>only</i> way to load an app on the phone.

1213641,story,,,2,1,sjwalter,"Ask HN: Review our webapp: QFile: File sharing for our satellite network",,"A bit of background is in order.\nI work for SSi Micro (www.ssimicro.com). We're a dynamic little company that's responsible for building (from the ground up) a satellite network that delivers broadband internet to some of the most remote communities on earth, scattered around Canada's Northern territories.<p>One of the problems our customers face is that of simply sharing files. A customer in Iqaluit wants to share some big presentations with a customer in Inuvik, for instance. The usual path for the file transfer is this (suppose the user is attaching the file to an email):<p>User's home in Iqaluit -- (NextNet NLOS microwave link) --> baste station in Iqaluit -- (Satellite modem, bounce off our geostationary satellite) --> our uplink in Ottawa.<p>Now the file is stored in our main email server in Ottawa. Now the recipient checks their email, and it's the same path, but in reverse: Ottawa -> Satellite -> Base station -> home.<p>This is really slow and inconvenient for our users, and depending on how saturated our satellite link is, a long upload can time out.<p>We've decided to solve this problem with what we hope is a simple-to-use webapp that manages file transfers in a far more optimized way. Here's how it works:<p>The user logs into QFile (http://www.qfile.ca) and uploads a file. Instead of having the upload go to the base and then immediately over the satellite, the upload first goes directly to the base station. (Each community has a local instance of a QFile server.) The benefit of this is that the user sees a much faster upload time (our microwave links are not terribly fast, but they're a lot faster and more stable than the satellite hop). Once the base station receives the file, it immediately begins to deliver it to our main QFile server in Ottawa. Once the Ottawa server receives the file, it uses a multicast transfer to transfer the file to every other community in our network. This way, when any other QFile user goes to get the file, it's already on their local base station and they don't have to deal with the slow hop over our satellite.<p>The webapp is our attempt at a really simple file manager/""publishing"" interface. The file manager is required because, well, users have to be able to manage the files they've uploaded. The ""publishing"" interface is (again, we hope) a simple way for the user to share the file with other users: Public (make a link anybody can click on), Email (email the link to a user for a one-time download), Slideshow (drag a folder of images onto here, get a link to a slick slideshow of those images), Workspace (invite a bunch of people to a workspace via email, and then update files as you wish and they're notified and can see all the files), and Facebook (push individual images or folders of images to your Facebook account).<p>We've been working really hard at making this a simple interface to what is a difficult thing to explain to our users (answering the question, Why wouldn't I just use dropbox? with a network diagram showing satellite hops and ""pushing to the edge"" isn't really that friendly). We'd love to know what you think.<p>http://www.qfile.ca<p>I've set up an account you can use to give QFile a whirl:<p>username: qfile_test<p>password: test/account",1269368846

I would be surprised if H1B's and other programs have no effect on wages and job opportunities in this field (though I know some counter that they don't).<p>One argument I imagine people make is, assuming H1B and other visa programs suppress wages, and this in turn retards the desire for young Americans to get into these fields, why is this a problem?<p>I suppose one could argue that restricting immigration will lead to higher wages, which ultimately will lead to more engineering students, but at a much higher expense. Ultimately this won't be globally competitive and is unnecessary when there are plenty of students from elsewhere in the world who will do equal caliber work at much lower cost.<p>I suppose one could argue that, but I wouldn't. Intellectually though, I'm hard pressed to say why our engineers really should be American born in larger quantities than they are today.
