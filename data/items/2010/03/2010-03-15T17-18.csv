You need to invest in many deals; I have been told that profitable angels do 10+ deals a year.<p>3. Low-end slices are typically $25k and up. It's a lot of work for companies to wrangle a large number of investors so minimizing that number is to their advantage.<p>4. It can take YEARS to return anything at all. I've invested in 24 startups since 2007; one exited so far.",1268672706

Most of the rest of the linked blog post is Tim explaining why he thinks Android's better than iPhone (and/or why he thinks Google is better than Apple). None of that material is new or noteworthy, none of it is new coming from Tim (he's expressed opinions on the subject before) and none of it will be unfamiliar to anyone who frequents <i>any</i> geek-oriented forum.<p>As I write this there are 48 comments in the thread here on HN. 40 of those 48 comments are the same Android vs. iPhone arguments everyone here has seen more times than they can count. Of the other 8, 3 are related to the process of how Tim got his new job. So that's a whopping 45 out of 48 comments which have nothing whatsoever to do with the actual bit of news announced in the linked article.<p>Which raises a couple questions:<p>* Is that really what you want from HN?<p>* Is a one-line summary of the article, minus the flamewar fuel, more or less useful than the actual article?<p>* Gee, Brain, what are we doing to do tonight? <i>(Answer: The same thing we do every night, Pinky: argue about Android versus iPhone!</i>)<p>(and for completeness' sake, yes, I flagged this link)",1268672607

If you take some time, do your homework, and make the right investment then the payoff could be quite good.<p>2. I understand your frustration. There's just nothing out there for the beginning angel. As you can tell from most of the answers here-- there really isn't a good answer. You're too rich to have the money sitting in a bond fund, and too poor to be Paul Graham. You're stuck in the middle, and the investments market (right now) doesn't have a home for you. You're also a prime target for some get rich quick investment schemes, so you ought to be careful.",1268672569
