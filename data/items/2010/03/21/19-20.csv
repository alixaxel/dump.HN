If there is any disappointment at Google with Android, its related to the direct to consumer model, and not the phone itself.<p>Today (in the US), most consumers purchase through retailers (wireless carrier stores and 3rd party retailers), and the phones are directly tied to specific carriers.  The Nexus One was an attempt to marginalize this model by providing a direct channel together with a menu of carrier choices for the consumer to pick from.  So far, the sales of the Nexus One show that direct to consumer hasn't worked.  However, as the choice of carriers available for the Nexus One is just now more plentiful, its a bit premature to judge whether the al-la-carte carrier choice will have significant impact.<p>The problem I see for the Nexus One is that its now approaching middle-age for a mobile phone, and newer phones are certainly going to emerge in the coming months that steal the attention.  So the al-la-carte carrier choice model may be too late in coming to have an impact, and therefore may not be the force for change in how consumers purchase phones and choose carriers.",1269200654

He claimed that software engineering is an immature field and that we will eventually learn how to apply engineering principles to get more reliable programs.<p>When I countered that you mostly don't even know what you're modelling and that the design state space is much larger in software, he retorted that all sorts of things can go wrong with just a single pipe in a chemical plant but that it doesn't stop reliable plants from being built.<p>But he didn't get it: that pipe is a component in a well understood framework. It's nothing like the unexpected things you get in software. The software equivalent is that of a buggy component whose specification is well understood - if you rewrite the component, you'll get what you expect. In software, proper specification is the rub.<p>I have worked with many electrical and electronic engineers (I studied CS) and not one of those engineers was on average better at writing reliable software. They did try hard to specify their systems in advance, but the actual systems soon started diverging from their specifications.<p>I grant that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but it is equally wrong to keep maintaining in full faith (and without convincing evidence) that software development is an engineering discipline.<p>I have never seen anyone argue convincingly for nor against the engineering approach in software.

It wasn't.<p>The insurers colluded with the providers to set artificial, market-oblivious standard prices for procedures on a region by region, hospital by hospital basis. From what I understand, prices were often set by allocation schemes negotiated between the payers and the providers, with no apparent regard to the actual cost, supply, or demand for the procedures. At the same time, even as they managed to drastically distort the pricing of health care, insurers apparently negotiated special payment processes directly with providers, thus creating not one but two artificial tiers of pricing.<p>It's meaningful to talk of ""sugar daddies"" and ""insurance"" only when there's a real market for health insurance. But no such market exists. For mainstream medical procedures, for the standard of care that Americans expect (a visit to a doctor, completion of the lab work the doctor requests, some form of radiology, and then a procedure or perscription to resolve whatever comes out of that diagnostic work), unless you are either willing to play chicken with the providers and say ""no"" when they try to collect debts, or willing to pay <i>incredibly, drastically inflated prices</i> for basic procedures, there is no way to get care without involving your insurer.",1269199085
