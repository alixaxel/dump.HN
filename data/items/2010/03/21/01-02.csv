I really, really hate labeling a type of music by the physical techniques used to generate the sound, I think it's a terrible way to think about the scene. (Though I aggressively concede that I seem to be in the minority on that view.) To me, your point is basically equivalent to saying that classical-style music with saxophones in the orchestra just isn't classical music anymore; I am sure you would disagree with that characterization and I'm not saying it's objectively true, but it's not part of how I think about musical classification.",1269136386

1207347,story,,,4,0,apsec112,"Paying young people for their performance",,"""Now companies increasingly have to pay employees market price for the work they do. One reason is that employees no longer trust companies to deliver deferred rewards: why work to accumulate deferred rewards at a company that might go bankrupt, or be taken over and have all its implicit obligations wiped out? The other is that some companies broke ranks and started to pay young employees large amounts. This was particularly true in consulting, law, and finance, where it led to the phenomenon of yuppies."" - http://paulgraham.com/credentials.html<p>As a college student who has been looking at entry-level law, consulting, and finance jobs for a while now, I really don't think this is true. These organizations pay young people ""a lot"", but it's ""a lot"" only by middle-class American standards. By <i>internal</i> standards, these organizations pay young people a pittance, in comparison to what they pay their senior people.<p>I would certainly agree that, during the 1980s, there began an increasing trend of job-hopping: working at a new company every few years, instead of working at the same company for forty years or more. This, notably, did <i>not</i> increase salaries; median salaries in the US, adjusted for inflation, have not risen at all since the 1970s (cite: http://www.eurotrib.com/files/3/051014_US_median_income.jpg). However, it probably did lead to the top performers getting paid more, and the bottom performers getting paid less. It also accelerated the breakup of large unions, whose bargaining power was diminished when companies found it increasingly easy to hire and fire at will.<p>This trend, even though it is real, does not really apply to consulting, law and finance, because these organizations are run very differently from the rest of the economy. For one thing, they operate as <i>partnerships</i> rather than public companies- the profits the company generates go directly to the high-level employees, rather than to outside shareholders. This insulates these companies from any threat of outside takeover, which was a major motivation for the destruction of the ""corporate ladder"" during the 1980s.<p>Secondly, they are all professional services companies, where the high-level people do sales and schmooze clients, and the low-level people do all the grunt work. A salesman can be measured directly by how many customers they bring in and how many deals they do. A low-level grunt, on the other hand, is much more difficult to measure (see, eg.: http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-in-investment-banking-by-slacking-off-and-pretending-to-work-hard/, which describes how to get ahead in investment banking without actually doing a lot of work).<p>As a result, the top people in these industries get paid <i>spectacularly</i> more than the newer, young people, frequently more than <i>ten times as much</i>. A new investment banker, just out of college, can reasonably expect to make six figures (http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/investment-banking-salaries-mcdonalds/). However, the top people, the Managing Directors, get paid seven up to eight figures. It's the same thing in consulting: you can make $70,000 straight out of school, but the partners will make $500,000 or $1,000,000. And in law (specifically corporate law), the starting salary may be $160,000, but the salary after five years is more like $400,000, and the partners take home millions.<p>And the higher salaries of these young people doesn't really reflect their value, in most cases; it just reflects the fact that they work an insane number of hours. If you're an investment banking analyst making $100,000 (including bonus), but you have to work 100 hours a week, that comes out to about $19 per hour, which is not much at all for someone with a 3.8 GPA from an Ivy League school (most of these companies only recruit at top schools).<p>So, why do these salaries seem like ""a lot""? Probably because most Americans have little contact with the upper class, and don't have a good idea of how large it is, or how much money the people in it make. When most people think of ""rich"", they think of people like their neighborhood doctor, who makes around $150,000 a year; in comparison, making $100,000 just out of school seems like a lot. However, if you look at the actual numbers (cite: http://www2.physics.umd.edu/~yakovenk/papers/EPL-69-304-2005.pdf), 99th percentile income in the US is $400,000. If we define the ""rich"" as the top 1% of the US population in terms of annual income, that means that there are <i>1.5 million</i> rich people in the US. By this definition, there are more rich people in the US than Muslims, Hindus, or Buddhists (assuming that the children of the rich also count as ""rich""). The <i>minimum</i> income needed to be rich is $400,000, and the <i>average</i> income of a rich person is more like $700,000 or $900,000. So these law, finance and consulting companies certainly don't allow young people to join the ranks of the American upper class, even if they do get paid $100,000 a year.",1269135101

If you need a certain number of XP to pass the class, and you don't gain enough at a critical juncture in the course, do you get a chance to make it up?  Doing away with the time component of class based instruction, where exams are administered at given, set times, and you just need to prove that you know the material come the last day of class, would be an XP based system.  I've had teachers do that before.  Really, expecting students to make specific progress at a specific rate over the semester, as codified in regular exams, is a way to avoid having to deal with teaching different things at different times to a group of students, in the name of efficiency.",1269134145

Yes, getting the merchant account is majorly annoying (went with FirstData).<p>The fastest and cheapest way to set it up is Paypal subscriptions - I have done this many times using their IPN notification system.  But I'm afraid to do it again because they keep screwing over websites (google it for the horror stories), so while I'm tempted - it's probably better to go the Spreedly/Chargify route at this point.",1269133978

It appears to me that what happens is that at some point, a thing that once required an exercise of self-control to resist no longer does. It is as though the weight has been lifted, not that our strength has increased.<p>The chronic adaptation, in other words, is habit. The process of intentionally breaking old habits and establishing new ones seems to always be particularly taxing, but maintaining an established habit, regardless of what it is, is easy. (Ignoring external factors, of course.)<p>With that in mind, it would be good advice to conserve the limited resource, or at least acknowledge it's variable availability and adjust your expectations of your own abilities in accordance. I'm certain there are many among the ambitious folk of HN who have taken on too many new and exciting challenges at once only to find that they turn into new and exciting chores that we can't even force ourselves to do, instead turning to the things that <i>don't</i> require self-control instead.<p>We call that procrastination and treat it like a challenge to overcome, too, but if it's a symptom of <i>depleted</i> self-control (and not a weak self-control ""muscle""), then we'd be better served by being miserly about how we spend it than by taxing it unnecessarily. In that sense, there is a meta-adaptation in how you consciously manage your attention.",1269133966

You could probably be integrated in a day or so.  They are mainly geared toward downloadable software vendors, but I just use the ""serial code"" field as an Activation Code that the user enters into their profile page.<p>BMT Micro's royalty rate is around 10%, have awesome customer service, and just added a recurring option.  The main downside is limited control over the template.  I would also look into FastSpring since they are newer and seem to have more flexibility with the store configuration.",1269133397
