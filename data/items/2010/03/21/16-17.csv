If you're the average company making a Rails website, you'll get by with common-sense optimizations, database indexes and the like that you'd have to do in PHP anyways. I've worked on probably a dozen Rails apps and have only ever had to resort to horizontal scaling and memcached once.<p>I think the key is that developing the app and scaling the app can be separate tasks. If you do it right, for the lion's share of your app code is still focused on the app, and all the caching and whatnot is handled elsewhere. In PHP, if you had to use memcached it would be a massive change that would touch every corner of your codebase.

Afterwards, shopping will get easier.  You will be able to look at a rack of clothes and say 'wrong color', 'wrong shape', 'no..no..no..yes, I will try this one thing on'.

Additionally, pretty much all online news sites collect demographics that feed the ads that are displayed for the user. Ads are not targeted for the general audience like that in the print format.<p>In the case of wsj it would seem they are offering more generalized content in order to reach a wider audience to compensate for a potential niche audience saturation.<p>I think paid is definitely the future for news sites. Ad revenue brings in no where near the amount of revenue a paid subscription can generate per user. The question remains is there a hybrid model that can do both in a similar way that the airlines have pricing tiers on their seats to fill the planes (not everyone will pay for a first class/business seat, but that class generates way more money than all of coach). WSJ is doing selective free content and has a free registration that allows you to see a surprising amount of content, but what you get is not predictable (meaning when/if/what subscriber content will eventually be visible to the free registrant).<p>I would like to see a mainstream newspaper test a strategy where if you want the current news you need to pay, but over time (as less paying subscribers are interested), it is released into the free space to monetize potential ad revenue.",1269187683

""<p>Actually, this speaks to me personally. The yuan is not really fixed to the dollar permanently - it's been climbing gradually over the past several years. As an American in China, I have done just as you have said - I've gradually moved as much of my cash to RMB as possible and enjoyed each time the gov't raised my purchasing power back home. As I now operate a business here and am paid in RMB, I personally look forward to it happening again in the near future.<p>Also, I think, at least in the short term, you are right. Increasing the value of the yuan will noticeably damage the average Joe's quality of life back home. All those little 'made-in-China' things that you buy without even noticing will suddenly become more expensive. Which means you will get less of them. Which means you will have less of the stuff that you are accustomed to having.<p>In the long term, I think a floating Yuan is probably healthy for all parties involved - for the US, because <i>some</i> of the imported Chinese goods will be produced back on home soil and for the Chinese because it will foster more domestic, service-oriented consumption (i.e., a modern economy).",1269187579
