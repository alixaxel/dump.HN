When they get to the point where someone might, the notion of them turning down $100MM won't seem so funny anymore.<p>Similarly, DHH isn't writing ""don't sell your business if you burn out"". If you burn out and you can't fix it, do right by your team. DHH is critiquing the notion that you should build to flip, and the notion that there's great honor in doing that repeatedly. It's undeniable that there is a mythology around ""serial entrepeneurs"" who repeatedly flip companies.<p>You know what would be incredibly boring? A DHH post that anticipated and acknowledged every special case and every objection. ""What if someone offered you $1Tn"" is an especially b o r i n g objection. One of the reasons people read DHH's articles and don't read ours is that we write things like ""Of course, if someone offers you $100MM, you should blah blah b l a h b l a h"", and he doesn't.<p>It is also OK for him to be wrong.

1216394,comment,1216255,1216255,0,0,Perceval,,,"Steve Jobs <i>was</i> a serial entrepreneur—starting Apple, then Pixar, then NeXT, then returning to transform Apple.  Maybe he didn't want to be at the time, but in his Stanford commencement speech he said (with the benefit of retrospect) that getting fired from Apple was one of the most important events in his life.  Here's what he said:<p>""I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.""<p>Now, Steve didn't flip Apple, he didn't sell out.  But the point is that he did start over from scratch.  37signals are right that building a business for the principal purpose of flipping it is probably a perverse goal.  But being a serial entrepreneur is not a bad thing, and Jobs is precisely an example of why it's not a bad thing.",1269454165
