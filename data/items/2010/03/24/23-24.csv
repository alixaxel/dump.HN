They came up with some things that involved taking poisonous metals as a ""cure"" but I privately went to a meta-cognitive therapist instead.<p>The result was that I can now ""ignore"" the errant part of my mind with the more usual, conscious ""executive"" part (I don't know all the terminology, sorry) but enjoy the fruits and spontaneity of what the uncontrollable side has to offer <i>when I choose</i>. It works, because I couldn't be much happier or productive now! :-)<p>I spoke with friends who had depression and were taking reasonably pedestrian drugs like Prozac, and while they were ""happier"" in the typical sense, ultimately they were <i>less satisfied</i> with life because the drugs dampened their vitality in a way they couldn't define.<p>(I know, a serious overshare, but that's part of the deal ;-) I suspect the majority of people have these sorts of issues at times, but society has entrained most people to keep it under wraps.)",1269474975

I rarely, if ever, see anyone who actually talks extensively with Chinese international students or who does business in China claim that the level of totalitarianism in the PRC actually causes anyone to live in constant fear of the government. Most likely this is a combination of regular Chinese citizens not caring and the government not being the evil empire some commentators appear to think it is.<p>I agree China needs to open up more both because of basic human rights principles and also because well-executed democracy is an excellent guard against government corruption, but I'm rather frustrated by the lack of attempts to understand the motivations and viewpoints of the PRC.<p>At its core, can you really blame the PRC for putting social stability first when it's at the head of a country that's seen constant civil war, invasion, and been on the wrong end of Imperialism since the end of the Qing Dynasty?
