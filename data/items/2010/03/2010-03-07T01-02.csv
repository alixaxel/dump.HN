If you show up early to get a good seat you end up watching generic advertising while getting popcorn etc, then in the theater before showtime you get the same generic advertising.  Then, at the stated movie start or a little after you get 7-10 minutes of higher quantity advertising, then 5 to 15 minutes of movie previews then the movie.<p>So, if you show up early enough and you really can watch a full hour of advertising before the movie starts.

The space that gets sold through third parties is the crap that your own sales team just couldn't manage to sell.

They understand their own niche and can establish ongoing relationships with advertisers. Advertising online is just done incredibly poorly relative to real advertising.",1267926562

This could even be highly automated like it is now, where the catalog available to you would be based on the nature of your content and the catalog could provide you with estimated rates based on historical data.<p>In my opinion the key distinction is that you're directly serving ads as part of your content, instead of embedding some arbitrary external content into your pages.
