1172160,comment,1171927,1172069,0,0,romland,,,"<i>If ads are discreet and respectful of the viewer then I'd certainly be prepared to stop blocking them.</i><p>I can only speak for myself but a solution does not seem that far off (at least not to get me to see your ads). While I agree that some sort of code of conduct may be a good idea, I don't really see it working out in the long run what with everyone always being willing to sacrifice good will for a quick buck.<p>That said, I use NoScript in Firefox and I run it for other reasons than blocking advertisements and I don't have an ad-blocker installed. If I white list a website it means I made a deliberate choice to trust whatever it is going to throw at me. The most important thing here is that I did <i>not</i> allow any third party to serve me some random code (plain markup is fine). I have no way of telling whether the site I just white listed in fact knows what their external advertisers actually serve. And this is proven again and again by how site owners expect visitors to contact the site when they see an ad that is intrusive so that they can ""nuke it"". This to me makes it a no deal.<p>To kill two birds with one stone: Serve your advertisements from your own servers and if I want to read your content I have to make a choice whether to trust you and your webserver(s). If you violate my trust then I will go elsewhere and I am no longer a waste of your resources and you are not a waste of mine.<p>If I have for some reason decided to not let you run dynamic content on whatever device I am currently on you simply have to respect that or I leave. You still have the opportunity to serve me static ads, surely that's got to be worth something. You don't know my reasons for not white listing you (as this article states as well). What surprised me about this link was that I did not see a single advertisement on the page. This means they are all using JavaScript or Flash. Sorry, your loss. And eventually my loss as well since the website might not live to see another day due to lack of income.<p>Incidentally, easy white listing [of script execution] for sites is also the only thing stopping me from switching to Chrome today.",1267909190

When the Facebook app platform first came out a few years ago, I whipped up an app that integrated with Amazon associates in about a week's worth of time.

Companies like Microsoft and Apple get some time with politicians easily, and make the pitch that they just want to protect the competition from reselling functionality that they offer. I can see a lot of dumb politicians supporting that idea, especially when compared with the pharma industry. And then we anti-software patent guys come in -- first, we'd be lucky to get a couple seconds to say hello. Second, our pitch would be that software patents stifle innovation, rather than grow it, but would have little proof. Also, every other technology industry has a patent law, so the Congressmen would be like, ""Why not software, too? Why should that be so special?"" And if you try to tell them that sometimes there's like only 4 optimal ways to do a given task sometimes, and therefore we shouldn't be punished for it, they just wouldn't grasp that concept. If you run to the Republicans, they would consider you anti-capitalist. (And I say that even though I mostly vote Republican.) If you run to the Democrats, they would say that these big companies like Microsoft and Apple bankroll their campaigns, so there's no way they would not support those proprietary agendas. There's no way out except through the courts.<p>In our agenda, we come off as a bunch of disorganized geeks, and politicians don't seem to mix well with geeks, especially disorganized ones.

For years before ad-blocking became widespread, the more tech-savvy users complained and warned that the more aggressive ads became, what with popups/unders, talking ads, etc., the more likely they would be blocked. (I seem to remember we were poo-pooed by the marketers saying that ""real users don't care,"" though this may be a nerd-chip-on-shoulder revisionist memory.)

With AdBlock Plus, you hit the drop-down and choose Disable on foobar.com, but it requires an active interaction to seek that out. GlimmerBlocker for the Mac is even more buried (as it's a proxy, it's in System Preferences.) Maybe switching to putting placeholders where the ads <i>would</i> be with a short message and a single click to whitelist would make it a little easier for users to both see how many ads a site's pushing as well as whitelist the site with the minimum amount of effort?
