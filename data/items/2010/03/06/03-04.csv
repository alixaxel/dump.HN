It only really works well for that social set up.  If mom is not primarily a homemaker (with maybe a part-time job) who can shuttle the kids around, suburban sprawl is very isolating for kids -- or anyone else who doesn't drive/can't afford their own car (the poor, the elderly who can't safely drive anymore, etc).  American demographics have changed and most ""family units"" no longer fit the nuclear family model.  So suburban sprawl serves a great many Americans quite poorly, regardless of their opinions of cars or lawns.<p>MZ: wannabe urban-planner who got sidetracked along the way.",1267847528
