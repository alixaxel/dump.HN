If HTTP and HTML didn't exist, we would be compelled to invent them... as we were fifteen years ago when we <i>did</i> invent them.<p>However, HTTP and HTML <i>do</i> exist. And all these other tools are already built on that common platform. So exactly what are we trying to further standardize? What remaining problem are we trying to solve?<p>Because the remaining technical barriers to publishing the same text on (e.g.) Twitter, Flickr, and Blogger are very few: A bit of login hassle (ameliorated by persistent cookies), a bit of copying and pasting. You can automate even more of these keypresses away [1], but I suspect that such efforts are approaching the point of diminishing returns. Because the ultimate bottleneck to publishing the same content on multiple platforms isn't really the time required to paste it. It's the time required to <i>recraft</i> the content to fit each different medium, and the (far longer) time which you must spend <i>living</i> in each medium's community before you learn the difference between what is locally appropriate and what is painfully tone-deaf.<p>---<p>[1] See, e.g., <a href=""http://www.janrain.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.janrain.com/</a>.",1267768411

1168909,comment,1167817,1168442,0,0,lmkg,,,"It's not just that Steam has carrots and Ubisoft used sticks. The point of introducing a stick is to hit the people who are misbehaving, so that they'll want to stop. But Ubisoft is inconveniencing the paying customers more than the pirates. They're using the stick on the wrong people altogether! That creates an entirely backwards incentive scheme.<p>Meanwhile, DRMing a game through Steam makes it more convenient for the consumer rather than less convenient[1]. They turned the protection scheme from a hindrance into a feature, and a desirable one at that. Most importantly, the carrot wasn't just stapled on to sweeten the deal, the features of Steam are leveraging the DRM itself. I have never heard anyone say ""man Steam is awesome, but they should take out the DRM""--it's an intrinsic part of the additional features. That's what makes it so impressive to me.<p>[1] There are tradeoffs so YMMV, but the tradeoffs are easily worthwhile for the majority of players, which is Good Enough.",1267767164
