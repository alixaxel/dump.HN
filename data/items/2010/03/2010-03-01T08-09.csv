For each exercise, I do 3 sets of 8-12 reps and increase if I can get to 12 or decrease if I can only do 8.<p>I think one of the biggest errors I see at the gym are people NOT pushing 110%. No gains will be made unless you push yourself to the max. The way I judge a successful workout is how hard it is to lift my arms up to shampoo my hair in the shower afterward, how much my legs feel like jelly walking down stairs after, etc. I also love feeling sore the next day. It equals muscle fiber recruitment. Diet also has a big impact, but... I won't delve into that here.<p>I'm also starting to add in a bit of cardio post-lifting so I can get below 10% body fat (post lifting is the best time to run as your body is in the optimum state to burn fat), and just bought a pair of vibram fivefingers in preparation. Excited! Research barefoot running if you haven't heard of it, it is enlightening.",1267433896

There's a few things that you can't do with a Terminal, such as seeing and easily editing all the info from Get Info at once, or most things involving the use of a contextual menu - especially seeing what programs are in the Open With list (there may be a launch services related command, but you still can't pick one without typing another command (open -a Application file).

1158352,comment,1158166,1158268,0,0,hendzen,,,"While I agree in general with the content of your first paragraph, your second paragraph has some inaccuracies that I found bothersome.<p>1) You claim that ""weighted dips and pullups"" combined with ""jogging up hills a few times a week"" amounts to a complete exercise regime. As far as dips and pullups go, the average person would benefit much more from a simple weightlifting routine like Starting Strength. Additionally, HIIT(High Intensity Interval Training) is a far more effective than steady-state cardio.<p>2) You state that the average person should pursue Olympic lifts if they want to ""take it further"". Olympic lifts are some of the hardest exercises to perform correctly, and can be dangerous when attempted by untrained novices. While this makes for good competition, this is impractical for the average trainee. The complex movements involved in performing Olympic lifts can be broken down into more isolated sub-movements, e.g. military press and the power clean rather than the entire clean and jerk. These sub-lifts are far easier to master, and thus more worthwhile to any trainee not looking to compete in an Olympic-style lifting competition.",1267432589

1158320,comment,1157527,1157960,0,0,davidw,,,"Exactly.  As someone who has done the occasional professional translation from Italian to English, here's what you have to go through:<p>* You have to understand the original text.  Not just 'get it', but completely understand it.  That includes understanding just what sort of bucket excavator a 'benne' is, or that an 'area golenale' is the area between a waterway and the levee, often where there is a curve in the river.  And you often have to be precise about these things; my Sicilian friend knew that 'golenale' was something to do with a river, but since they don't have a lot of waterways like the ones in northern Italy, wasn't able to really describe what it was in detail.<p>* Once you have completely understood and digested the article, you have to rewrite it in your language.  You can't just copy the structure of the original, because the tone and timing may well be off compared to what would be natural in your language.  Sometimes, you just plain have to be creative with what you're writing, because it's more important to convey a sense of something than an exact translation.  I once did a translation for a goldsmith in Vicenza whose original Italian text went off on how some piece was a ""festival for all five senses"" or some such nonsense (you're supposed to chew it?!), and had a whole article like that, which I had to basically write in a similar style, but adding 'flowery crap' that worked in English.",1267430947
