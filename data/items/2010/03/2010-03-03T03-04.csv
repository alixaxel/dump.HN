By Loren Feldman, on March 2nd, 2010<p>Well it seems we have yet more about Crunchgate to discuss. I thought we were all done with this. It really is the gift that keeps giving. It seems our newest character in this pathetic tale is some guy named Sam Odio. Seems Sam owns Divvyshot. Sam’s also an idiot, see he’s the guy who Dainel Brusivlosky wanted the McAir from for reviews on Techcrunch. He says he never got it for him though. Good for you Sam. HIS FRIEND DID GET DANIEL AN IMAC though for coverage. Right Sam? Anyway, Sam wrote a big woe is me blog post about how I outed his crimes with Jason Calacanis. Only problem is it never happened. A lot of people knew that Sam was dirty and weak. Many people know of his story with Daniel Bru. I had 3 different people tell me in fact. Amateurs like these guys tend to have big mouths. Especially dopey ones with shitty iphone apps.<p>Knowing how weak and stupid someone must be to be in this situation to begin with I knew I could scare this guy into confessing his evil ways. I tweeted. “You have 24hrs.” That’s it. That’s all I said. Well, when you are guilty and stupid that’s all it takes to make you cave, because that’s exactly what Sam did. Sam, you are a weak dishonest dope. You were played by Daniel Bru, and now you were just played by your own guilt.<p>All I needed to do was give the mere suggestion that Sam might get caught and he confessed, and that’s what happened here. Social engineering FTW!! Sam you need to stop crying. You are weak, dishonest and stupid. I can’t imagine these traits help you with building quality iphone apps.<p>The real story Sammy boy is not you, but which one of your friends BOUGHT DANIEL BRUSIVLOVSKY AN IMAC FOR COVERAGE ON TECHCRUNCH?<p>C’mon Sammy the truth will set you free. WHO BOUGHT DANIEL BRUSIVLOVSKY AN IMAC FOR COVERAGE ON TECHCRUNCH?",1267588799

If your dataset is two columns, x and y, a normal index could limit the xs efficiently, or limit the ys efficiently, but it couldn't limit both at the same time.  This means you'd always have to do a scan over a large number of irrelevant records.  The R-tree lets you get at the pair efficiently; you can get 2,2 without having to also look at 2,0; 2,1; 2,3; 2,...  This is the performance benefit; if you want to know about all the coffee shops near 2,2, you can just retrieve 2,2 and not have to look at the rest of the dataset.  If you need to implement wrapping, you can just retrieve the squares on the other side of the jump when someone requests records near the jump.  This probably behaves differently for ""things on earth"" than on arbitrary two-dimensional datasets, so it is left as an exercise for the reader.<p>I assume.

1163311,comment,1163068,1163068,0,0,jsz0,,,"Looks like a straight forward patent money grab. Apple just has to win on a few of these patents to negotiate a license fee with HTC. With one win under their belt they can extend it to other handset makers without too much trouble. All the sudden Apple is making some money off every cell phone sold as dumb phones disappear and get replaced by SmartPhones (or they just get smarter and infringe) Obviously Apple would never license iPhone OS to third parties so this seems like an attempt to simply license some of the technologies instead. I don't know the math but just based on the huge volume of cell phone sales alone it's gotta be worth a ton of money. If Apple loses in court other handset makers just continue to use these technologies and nothing changes. Unfortunately that's how the system works. Apple share holders were probably not too happy about the prospect of leaving all that money on the table.",1267588081

1163308,comment,1162520,1162520,0,0,jamesmcintyre,,,"When Google released the Nexus One it revealed another very important strategic imperative for offering Android free of charge.  Google realized that all the smartphone manufacturers were scrambling to build/acquire mobile operating systems that would stack up to the iPhone OS. These handset manufacturers were vulnerable, in other words, to the kind of offer Google would present to them in the form of the open source Android OS.  They needed what Android had to offer and the risks involved with sacrificing so much leverage over to Google (by relying on a third-party company for a key component of their product) did not outweigh the benefits of the collusion-like behavior all these manufacturers planned on partaking in by together building-out a large mobile app store that could champion iPhone's app store.  Now that Google has released their very own handset, the Nexus One, it's obvious why Google wanted as many Android handsets in hands as possible: higher the market share, more developers willing to build apps, the more apps in the Android app store the better the Nexus One looks in light of iPhone's enormously successful app store, the more Nexus One handsets Google will sell.<p>Google has always explained that they give Android away because it will encourage more usage of their web services.  But after Nexus One, it's obvious Google has more of a vested interest in Android than just ""the more people on the internet, the more money Google makes"".",1267587963
1163307,comment,1163039,1163039,0,0,warfangle,,,"While SQL can scale, I think this argument is a little spurious.<p>I truly dislike the NoSQL stance of ""never SQL;"" it has its place, and its place isn't necessarily at the twitters or the facebooks of today. SQL scales very well with datasets that make sense for RDBMS. CRUD style applications. Core business apps. Data that doesn't necessarily need to be mined furiously. Trying to shoehorn, say, a high-volume message system or intensely self-referential (graph) dataset into an RDBMS is a recipe for disaster, however. Many of the performance issues people see with RDBMS seem to stem from this, I believe.<p>If your app is hugely real-time datadriven and the datamining (if necessary) can be offloaded to cron jobs, a K/V store is great. And can scale very quickly and relatively cheaply.<p>If you're doing something hugely relational that, if loaded into a SQL server would require an immense number of self-joins (I'm looking at you, graph analysis) that must be done in real-time and not offloaded to a cron job, a graph database is probably the way to go. They're harder to scale to a huge amount of data, but certain datamining tasks are made much easier - and don't require distributed map-reduce execution. Scaling will get much easier once some systems come out that use k-means (or similar) to cluster and shard the data. That kind of smart scaling would be nigh impossible on either a KV store or a traditional RDBMS. Google gets away with it with BigTable because they can throw so much cheap iron at it - a truly brute force solution. The same solution that needs to be taken with RDBMS when you shoehorn datasets into it that don't make sense.<p>Emil Eifrem (Neo4J) said it best in his presentation ( <a href=""http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/342947902/presentation-graphs-neo4j-teh-awesome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nosql.mypopescu.com/post/342947902/presentation-graph...</a> ): NoSQL doesn't mean Never SQL, it just means Not Only SQL.",1267587952

For a lot of us working at web scale or on interesting new problems, an RDBMS won't scale.

I think this Google Trends chart captures my impression of the relationship between the two languages, though: <a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=php%2C+ruby&ctab=0&geo=us&date=all&sort=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends?q=php%2C+ruby&ctab=0&ge...</a><p>In addition, although you're definitely right in that there must be much more PHP documentation out there, you're not going to have much difficulty Googling for Ruby errors either - just because there will be fewer results doesn't at all mean that there won't be <i>any</i>. Just like in any other programming language mainstream enough to be considered a good language to learn on, any problem you have in that language will have already been experienced by someone else, and there'll almost definitely be an easily found Google result that'll solve that problem.<p>If you're really on a quest to create web apps and you'd like to invest in knowledge that'll help you and your webapps grow, I'd really strongly recommend learning Ruby (or Python) over PHP.<p>edit: on closer examination of that Google Trends chart, it looks like a good chunk of the Ruby results are from non-programming-related hits, but I'd still be willing to bet that the overall trend is the same.",1267586660
