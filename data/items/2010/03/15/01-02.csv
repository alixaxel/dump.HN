The backup plan had the same customer development steps in it -- it just moves along slower.<p>The main problem is getting distracted with funding, not finding it. I can always self-fund. People come to me to ask for help with making teams perform a lot faster. Hopefully I've built up a bit of a good reputation and that makes my phone ring. The problem is -- getting involved with other teams takes time and energy away from my own team and startup.",1268618397

So it must be the idea: they aren't getting it.<p>We emailed a few YC alum to review our application last month, and they all said we were a great team. One loved the  idea, one liked it, and one had no clue about the market (wasn't familiar with Facebook and quizzes). Our idea targets young people (12-25 yrs). Which leads to my thinking, that because they're unfamiliar with it (YC partners too old, would never do facebook quizzes), they brushed it off? One other issue is that they prefer built out products with users. We only had a working demo and proof of concept samples.<p>Either that or all the other teams were more spectacular.

Experience has taught you things since then.<p>You need to say the same thing over and over because students don't learn it all the first time. They, too, grow in experience over time. When I reread the things that I read twenty years ago, I see completely different nuances than I did before.<p>But, most importantly, you need to say the same thing over and over because <i>most people didn't hear you the first time</i>, and even if they did, <i>the world keeps making more people</i>.
