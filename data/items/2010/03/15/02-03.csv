If you look at the Feedback section of railscasts.com you'll see that the second most popular request is for Ryan Bates to ""Build an entire application over a series of screencasts"" and it has almost 1500 votes.<p>Others have already pointed this out, but it's important to keep the screencasts short and try to split each project up into smaller videos by topic. I like screencasts, but there's nothing worse than sitting through an hour long video for 10 minutes of content.

Consequently, tech bloggers keep posting the same content, as if to say <i>pay attention to this, it's still important</i>.<p>What we really need is a new label for content like Joel's, one that doesn't carry any negative stigma for text written long ago.
