1187898,comment,1187422,1187780,0,0,lmkg,,,"Whether it's a democracy depends on what you think a democracy is. My view is that a democracy is a system where all voices are encouraged to speak up, are heard, given due consideration, and approved or rejected by a community. The whole voting thing is one particular implementation of democracy. It's not necessarily a good approximation of those democratic ideals, but it's practical and it scales well, which makes it Good Enough(tm). Wikipedia's policy of considering arguments rather than votes for page-level decisions is something I would call more democratic than straight-up vote-counting, given the scale that it operates at, the strict (and explicit--rule of law is important) guidelines by which positions are weighed, and the general good-faith of those making the judgments.<p>YMMV. The definition of democracy is probably worth a thread in its own right. However, regardless of whatever label we each choose to call those policies, we're in accord that those policies are generally well-designed.",1268431031

This happens often.<p>Got plenty of experience driving on glazed frost. I even crashed once because of the car skidding ... went off-road, with the car rolling over a couple of times, and me and the other passenger survived with minor injuries.<p>From that experience I learned that whatever you do (besides wearing a seat-belt) you have to avoid trees.<p>IMHO, more experienced drivers are better, and I've seen some pretty good instincts coming from 40-50 year-old or so acquaintances.<p>I really don't know what I would do with a sudden acceleration problem. I would probably try to remain calm and wait for it to recover (pushing the acceleration / brake to trigger events, try to stop the engine), and try not crashing.<p>On a side note ... that's why I don't like cars with automatic transmissions. If my current car experienced a sudden acceleration problem, I could just take it out of gear or do an old-fashioned motor-brake.",1268431025

I've never understood why most management seems obsessed with just simply doing and not what you're doing or how you're doing it. If you are operating at 100% all the time, there is no time to reflect, revise and improve the tasks your are responsible for. Perhaps it's due to the illusion that employers need to squeeze every last minute of productivity out you, when in fact productivity was never intended to be measured in minutes.",1268430922
