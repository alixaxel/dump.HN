No different from what the actual government would do. Just like a legitimate government, I have not initiated force. At this point, two things would happen:<p>1. The government would initiate force against me to protect their own monopoly on the business of rounding up burglars, giving them a fair trial, and locking them up.\n2. The government would let me continue unimpeded, at which point they relinquish their monopoly on the legitimate use of force and cease to be a government. They are simply one of many competing retributive justice agencies, and we have anarchy.<p>As you can see, Rand's philosophy is not ""logically consistent""--it comes to vastly contradictory conclusions.",1268395188

Unbeknown to you, there's a web programmer in City B, commuting to City A every day. My idea would be to put these two in touch with each other, and eventually facilitate a job switch. You basically swap jobs (assuming you're both of equal proficiency, and the higher-ups agree to it), and don't have to commute any more. Yay/Nay?",1268395155
1186438,comment,1185224,1185224,0,0,rdl,,,"I drive even when I live in San Francisco.  A (nice) car costs about $1k/mo to keep in SF (parking, registration, insurance, payment) before the first mile driven, but it is how I would spend my marginal $1k at $5k/mo.<p>1) I need 24x7 access to datacenters, some of which are in super sketchy parts of town (200 Paul, in HP) or are in the South Bay.  A taxi might be an option, but a couple $200 taxi rides per month, plus an hour of waiting, would be a real pain.<p>2) I enjoy going on long trips, by land, with minimal planning.  Rental cars are more cost effective with depreciation, but I like having a familiar car, very well maintained, and keeping my firearms/EMT kit/etc. pre-positioned in the vehicle.  I'd consider flying, but my circle of equal pain makes driving to LA a 100%, and driving to vegas kind of borderline.  I drive to Portland or Seattle even.  Avoiding the hassle of the airport, more cargo capacity, and having a familiar vehicle on the other end, all add up.<p>3) Shooting sports.  Going to a shooting range with a long-arm on public transit is a no-go :)  Also, try taking 50 pounds of ammo on the bus.<p>4) Grocery shopping and other routine chores -- zipcar could accomplish a lot of this (and I have zipcared a pickup truck a few times, although their maintenance leaves a lot to be desired)<p>5) I love cars and driving, although not so much in SF itself.  Parking in SF largely makes driving in SF unpleasant.<p>6) I enjoy having more stuff with me than I can comfortably carry, and the car serves as a portable locker.  Having a spare laptop battery, paper, cases of bottled water, etc. a quick trip to the car away is nice.  Plus, while it's slightly paranoid, having a vehicle with emergency supplies nearby, and a means of travel, radio, power source, etc. is reassuring -- if there were an earthquake or other disaster, there's a limit to what survival supplies I might have on my person, but my car is good for 96h.<p>If I were commuting between SFO and SEA a lot, I'd probably buy a second car and keep one on each end, just to avoid needing public transit.  (and someday I'd go for a plane!)<p>None of this would be solved by a plush seat (like 1st class) or lack of crazy people and urine smell (like cabs vs. muni).  I am probably an outlier in the combination of these, but not on each individual point.<p>I do try to avoid needing a long daily commute, either through wfh or living near the office, so I can keep the car parked and walk to/from the office.  Still, I'd prefer a 10 minute drive to a 60-90 minute muni/bart/caltrain adventure to get to/from the office!",1268395023

1186436,comment,1184283,1184283,0,0,delackner,,,"This sort of question about the difference between a copy of you continuing to exist, and you yourself (the original ""copy"") continuing to exist; whenever I see this question in its various forms, I wonder if the question is being truly sincerely asked.<p>The obvious and meaningful answer is that the experience <i>you</i> have is of the total end of all further experience.  Death.  One or even a thousand completely perfect copies of you living onward in the universe is no comfort when the consciousness that started the whole game is not around to experience it.<p>Or in more simple form,<p>If you put someone to sleep, and haul them across a room, and then they wake up, this is totally different from writing down their entire molecuar composition, burning their atoms to a cinder, and then reconstituting said molecular composition on the other side of the room.  What wakes up is not you.  You are a burnt ash in the wastebin.<p>The truly fascinating question no one is discussing is: since our consciousness is made up of a vast combination of distinct physical parts, it could one day be possible to slowly replace those parts with artificial parts, with the transition from 100% original to 100% new parts being a transition in phases so small that the consciousness is never interrupted.  The resulting being is YOU, but at the end, all of what was you is gone.<p>Addendum:  People who have suffered severe trauma and lost large sections of the brain have managed to live.  If the substrate of the mind in question was an artificial system that can deal with such traumatic removals of core pieces,  is there some cross section of the constituent parts of the human mind that you could sever in half and end up with two distinct yet continuously conscious entities?",1268394901

1186423,comment,1186329,1186406,0,0,rms,,,"Exponential growth first and then new features is normally a viable path for a Web 2.0 business, but the founder of Chatroulette is finding it a bit hard to deal with new features when he has to worry about scaling his exponentially growing site, including limo rides and negotiations with Russian billionares.<p>To the OP: Isn't the strategy for succeeding at business in Russia to find out how to get in cars with Russian billionares? You would have to be careful though, because the existing billionares that own the social networking sites might not like you much.<p>This could also work for you as a quick flip, if you can get your page views up in a year and sell, that may be wiser than getting in cars with Russian billionaires.<p>---<p>Chatroulette would be completely illegal if run by a US founder. People that are under 18 are regularly exposed to live masturbating penises on Chatroulette. US Law is such that if a certain prosecutor was sufficiently morally offended by your existence, the founder of a Chatroulette clone could be charged with Federal Racketeering. I don't think the DMCA would provide any protection for the site operator.<p>So anyone from a country with rule of law similar to the USA should be really careful about starting a Chatroulette like site.",1268394383

HTTP might not be the best protocol for everything, ever, but it's a pretty good protocol. JavaScript might not be the best language for everything, ever, but it's a pretty good language.<p>The things that our OS:es do for us today, they can keep on doing, and that can be written in C or Java or assembler, but they will eventually have to expose that functionality to the Web platform, if anybody is going to use it.",1268391625
