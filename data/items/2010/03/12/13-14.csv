I assume the objection would be that you would thereby make it easier for people to then visit those sites.

I think thats enough people to make this definition true.<p>8) Being natively compiled does not make that program automatically faster. It depends on the use case (I/O vs compute bound) and it also depends on the quality and complexity of the code generator and optimizer. Furthermore, bytecode compiled languages (as opposed to native compiled) may be able to better optimize at runtime using JIT compilation due to being able to make assumptions you couldn't make at ""compile time"" in AOT compilation. Saying that <i>natively compiled</i> programs are faster than other kinds of programs is simply not always true.",1268402281

The book gives you plenty of ideas to mull over, and at the same time it's an exciting, plot-driven read.<p>I watched blade runner a month ago, a couple weeks after finishing Do Android Dream of Electric Sheep.

The fastest way out is through all ads placed on Mahalo and thats why they make money.<p>I hope you and everyone else now sees that all of these pages who make a little impact on their own but a big one on the whole are decreasing the quality of Google's index.
