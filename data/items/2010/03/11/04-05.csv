I realize, that american culture as a whole is (and has always been) somewhat infantile, but, still let's say, Terminator and Back to the Future were excellent movies. The more country get deindustrialized, the more people move to ""service economy and real estate"" the more they become disconnected from reality, and less you need to entertain their minds.<p>My major concern with Avatar - why in the hell everybody are american in this movie? Does Cameron beleive that USA will still be the ""power"" in 100 years? Or without stripe/stars flags everywhere nobody would watch  the movie?",1268283577

It's pretty difficult to meet people like that randomly. School gives you a chance to work with people so that you can find out what kind of team player you are, your own personal strengths and weaknesses.<p>Study what you really like and try to be damn good at it.<p>I'm just starting to learn programming, but I think most people would acknowledge that combining knowledge from other fields makes you better in the field that you choose to specialize in. You also get access to teachers who can guide you along the difficult parts when you get stuck. Find good teachers, and you might not find school a waste of time. =)<p>School provides resources that are relatively freely available for you to take advantage of. There are funding schemes, equipment, computers, a captive audience to test on, an alumni network, overseas opportunities..<p>It's really up to you how you manage your time during those 4 years.

This is a little slower than a direct include() because of the table look up first.<p>This could be causing it to render slow if you use 'require_once' a lot for the processing of your page. In your example, the lookups could cause your page to load slower. Note that if you type in your javascript via HTML no other processing is done as its treated as part of a text block.<p>Now with some context, to speed up the load of the page you should use include() instead of require_once. You must insure that this has only happened once per file during the processing of the request, or it will include that code again. This could cause a class redefinition error or bootstrap code to be run more than once.<p>If keeping track of that stuff gets tricky - its a sign that your PHP program is not structured enough to determine request-flow.

Either way you will come out knowing far more math and science that will allow you to do some really cool CS stuff after if thats what you want to do.<p>I minored in CS and so just took some of the more advanced classes, a graduate class on computer graphics, a grad class on computer vision, one on mechatronics, one on Lisp. I don't think I would have been able to learn that stuff as rigorously without a professor. The other courses I would recommend - Operating Systems and Compilers will teach you a LOT. I passed on them but I know people who took them and got a lot out of them.<p>Also about your free time, I know it seems like you are pressed for it right now but college is only 4 years. You wil graduate at 22 and have 43+ years of a career. I work 60-80 hours a week on school stuff and find plenty of time for my own side projects, partying, I was even on a sports team for 3 years. You can do it (you don't sleep much though unlike in the movies where everyone sleeps until 3pm). After graduation I'm going to be working exactly 40, max 50, with a 5 minute commute. Thats it. I'm going to have so much free time to do my side projects that I don't mind missing out on them for the last 4 years when I learned so many other things.",1268281752

Frankly, although cc-mode is fantastic for indentation and stuff, it offers a small fraction of the features of Eclipse or NetBeans.<p>Yes, I've used ctags and I've used etags. They tend to be interesting approximations but are never 100% reliable. They don't do a deep sematic analysis of my program. (For example, they don't understand C macros.) They don't update as I type.<p>The closest I've ever seen has been the ""Semantic Bovinator"" thingy. I have never managed to get it to run, nor has anybody I've seen try. You experience may be different, of course. (I realize that by posting this I'm inviting a raft of people to post and say ""It works for me!"" :) )",1268280067

They'd be defined file-by-file, or block-by-block, with the keys being stored elsewhere (but where?), or there's just one universal master key.  Considering their security is just theatrical in nature, I'd bet they have one master key.",1268280063
