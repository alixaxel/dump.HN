Some of what he is saying is a little shoddy, since Fisher actually came up with a much more robust, but less used, method of inference called Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which currently stands with The Bayesian Theory as the competing (yet partially complimentary) theories of statistical inference. Strict, but arbitrary, distinction between the null H0 and alternative H1 hypotheses, which is what p-values suggest, is as careless as the article points out.",1269978959

Just as an example, a person can indeed act effectively in uncertain but somewhat ordered environment but virtually no human being can tell you anything like the probability distribution of the events which they deal with in daily life.<p>So basically, we do indeed need new approach different from both the probabilistic and the pure-logical approaches. But problem is that melding these various existing approaches into something coherent and usable is far more easily said than done. One clear problem with any such system is that the complexity explodes for a formal specification which involves both probability and logical process.<p>I suggest people call their approach ""a general theory"" <i>after</i> they do something impressive with it.

Don't care about making millions: as long as I can pay the mortgage and afford good food, upkeep the house, keep the kids fed & clothed, I'll be happy.<p>In the short term I focus on making the most of what I have right now. Like you said, it's easy to get suckered into ""I'll make a ton of money right now so I can relax later"" but later never comes! Much like it's easier to fix your own faults instead of blaming others, I find it's easier to make the most of the present instead of pipedreaming the future. You can still plan for the future: just remember that live turns on a dime.<p>As far as your comments about the Maker movement: I have always loved to make things and I was really perplexed that it's now a ""movement."" I've been reading magazines about crafts, boatbuilding, metalworking etc. and been surrounded by people making things for so many years that I guess I just assumed there were Makers all around us :-) I wonder if the ""movement"" is really just among knowledge workers who weren't aware just how many of us still actually create with our hands?",1269976960

Say a systems administrator instead, they have knowledge of how to use keyboards and software and things, such details are unnecessary for the formulation of good software engineering, surely this can simply be skipped .<p>That's utterly crazy on the face of it, so why is it ok for designers to waste the time of developers?<p>For literally hours on end it is several million permutations of ""move it 2px to the left, no, right, no, up, no down, I mean right align, I mean center, I mean split it, I mean add that element, I mean do this, do that"" and <i>worst of all</i> ""What do you think of x"" like I have any opinion on the aesthetics / presentation of any given site. I simply couldn't care less, aesthetics and design do not appeal to me in any way shape or form; that's why I'm a developer and not a designer.<p>Isn't this one of the primary reasons we even <i>have</i> frameworks that have a seperation of concerns between presentation and logic? So that the artsy but code illiterate types can mess around at the surface layer without messing up the code? Is it <i>really</i> so much to ask that the designer just mess around in the view layer till their heart's content? It's in version control, it's not like they're going to permanently break anything. Yet I find it a sisyphean task to convince these people that they <i>need</i> to know this stuff and not to bother me with it.<p>Meanwhile, I get no code written because a designer can't figure out the simple semantics of html/css, basic version control and mess with firebug for themselves.<p>So no, I don't think it's ok.",1269976180
