I gave him the work and he got his team over in India to do it in about 90mins.

But you'd be surprised what you can negotiate for when taking a job. 6 weeks of vacation is not entirely unheard of, even in the U.S., even for U.S. companies.<p>But it doesn't scale quite like that. Ideally, your presence in the company is creating value for the company. And I don't mean in some kind of intrinsic sense. I mean in real dollars.<p>A person making $100k for a company better be making the company <i>at least</i> that much money - they should be making at least 1.5x their salary for the company to stay in business and the company is probably betting they are worth 2x their salary. It's not just your salary or salary + benefits, but the loss the company will realize by you not being there in terms of lost sales (which is what it all ends up as in general, it's what everybody in the company is working towards, even the janitorial staff). So negotiating a $10k pay cut for 5 more weeks of vacation looses the company $10-30k off the bottom line.<p>Vacation is there because it costs the company more to <i>not</i> give you vacation (burn-out, sloppy work, quitting, smaller employment pool, etc.) than to give it to you. So they strike a balance and say ""2 weeks will keep our employees minimally happy without costing us too much money in the end"".<p>If you don't like that, there are <i>plenty</i> of part-time jobs you can apply for -- some even pay pretty well.
