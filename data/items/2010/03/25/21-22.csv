He basically would make time for anyone that wanted to interview him, understanding the viral potential in terms of follow-on press coverage and of course, new customers. (Incidentally, Salesforce's Marc Benioff describes a similar approach to press in his bio, but mostly concentrated on major publications and journalists in the early days -- this was before most blogs and viral phenomena)<p>2) Patzer described spending a lot of time on finding (and paying for) the right name. Easy to understand, spell, and enter into a browser address bar were key. He thought his competitors were crazy for choosing names that were hard to spell or pronounce -- he specifically mentioned Geezeo.com and Wesabe.com .<p>One other thing: Patzer claimed he didn't spend anything on marketing in the talk that I saw. But from Putori's post, it seems that Mint.com did spend money on a PR agency, which surely wasn't cheap.",1269553457

1219567,comment,1219064,1219472,0,0,gte910h,,,"Table sugar is sucrose.<p>First off to turn sucrose into its component molecules, it must first undergo a reaction with a sucrase enzyme. So there is at least one metabolic step left out there. Studies are being done to test if Sucrase is actively regulated by the body or not. In either case, this metabolic step must occur, and can only occur so fast (limited by the amount of sucrase in your body), no matter how much sucrose you ingest. This means slower absorption of sucrose over HFCS as you get this with the whole load of glucose in HFCS instantly, but only see the sucrose's glucose released over time.<p>Secondly, fructose has many forms. In sucrose, the fructose is often of the fructose-5 variety. In HFCS, it completely depends on the application, as any heat applied to a fructose-5 molecule upon separation from the glucose turns it into fructose-6.<p>Fructose-6 is notably less sweet than Sucrose\nThis means when used in heat processed goods, you use quite a bit more HFCS (including all baked goods, etc) then the equivalent amount of sucrose. This means more calories.<p>Secondly, there are all different kids of HFCS. Notably, there is one with 38% less fructose than sucrose (HFCS 42), one with 22% more fructose than sucrose (HFCS 55) and one with 800% more fructose than table sugar (HFCS 90, often seen in diet foods I might add). They are all used for differing applications, but HFCS is not a single product, and most of the forms are likely metabolically worse in any amount of a single dose than the equivalent sweetness worth of sucrose. It is important you calculate your fractions correctly when realizing the differing amounts of fructose, as they're larger then they appear at first.<p>One could say a steak and the meal in your small intestines are ""about the same thing"" but I doubt you'd want to eat it then, and you'd be as accurate as saying table sugar is basically HFCS 55<p>(all percentages are in terms of ""per molecule of glucose"", which is what appears to be important as per the evolving science of satiation)",1269552836

Or vice versa?",,"BACKGROUND:  I'm a lawyer, formerly a public software company GC and large-IP-law-firm partner, now in private practice; I have other credentials I won't go into here.<p>For a long time I've been interested in streamlining my contract-drafting and -review work. I've never been fond of the reinventing-the-wheel that seems to go on in just about every negotiated transaction.<p>""THE PRODUCT"":  With that in mind, I've been developing some easily-editable contract forms -- really, they're highly-configurable, checklist-like compendiums -- that I'll be making available under a Creative Commons license.  I've annotated the forms pretty extensively with what I hope is reader-friendly commentary.  The forms aren't a substitute for legal advice, of course, but they could give lawyers a decent head start in drafting and reviewing contracts.  I've also found them very useful as teaching materials in a law school contract drafting course that I teach.<p>Following the advice I've read here and in pg's essays, I want to get a version of  ""the product"" out there for people to look at.  Toward that end, I've posted a sample two-page nondisclosure agreement (NDA) as an editable Word document, along with a PDF excerpt from the longer-form annotated NDA compendium.<p>The documents are at http://www.TATECompendium.com.<p>QUESTIONS:  Most HN readers aren't lawyers, but some of you probably work with lawyers from time to time, so I'd appreciate your input as business people on the following.  (I'm posing analogous questions to lawyers.)<p>QUESTION 1:  To what extent would you be comfortable giving your lawyer either a short form or a compendium form like this, and asking whether it made sense for him/her to use it as a starter draft in doing your legal work?<p>QUESTION 2:  I've put a good bit of work into the project, so I'd like to try to monetize it at least somewhat, but I'd also like to create as few barriers to widespread adoption as I can.  Should I --<p>OPTION A:  (1) Give away for free an editable Word-document version of both the short-form NDA and the complete NDA compendium, _without_ annotations, and  (2) use e-junkie to _sell_ a locked- and branded PDF of the complete compendium _with_ annotations?<p>Option A would amount to selling the annotation content as an e-book, while giving away editing convenience for both short- and long-form drafts.<p>or<p>OPTION B:  (1) Give away the short-form NDA, in editable Word-document form, and a locked PDF of the complete annotated compendium, and (2) sell an editable Word document of the complete compendium?<p>Option B would amount to giving away an editable short-form starter draft, and also giving away the annotation content, but selling editing convenience for a long-form draft.<p>For weeks I've been leaning toward Option A, but recently I've been wondering whether Option B might be better over the long run.<p>Any thoughts?  All (constructive) comments and suggestions gratefully received.   I'm especially interested in feedback about what other contract types could use starter-draft compendiums like this.<p>FYI, I've got a few other contract types pretty much done -- consulting-services agreement, Web site terms of service, employment agreement, reseller agreement, etc.<p>Thanks in advance.",1269552557

A related note: fruit, while generally considered good for you, also has a lot of sugar/fructose. In particular, the process of selective breeding has made fruits like bananas ever sweeter, much more so that our primitive ancestors would have encountered. Now I consider most of it (aside from berries) in the same category as candy.",1269551407

If you just eat fresh vegetables, fruits, meats, and whole grains you won't ever have to worry about what's hidden in the ingredients because there is only one ingredient:  whatever you cooked.<p>I know, easier said than done, especially since it requires a little cooking, but I'm seriously surprised by the amount of people I see at work saying ""I can never lose weight"" - then I see them in the break room at lunch nuking a pakaged frozen dinner.  Just stop, ask yourself ""did my grandma eat this?""  If the answer is no, then don't eat it.  This is actually a great question to ask because it doesn't matter what culture you are from.  People two generations ago didn't have access to food made in factories.  It was all fresh from a farm, and it was good for us.",1269551320
