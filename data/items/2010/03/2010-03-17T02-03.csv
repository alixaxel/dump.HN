1197589,comment,1196928,1197493,0,0,powauth,,,"Interesting. My talks (at least with older people who went to college) have given me quite a different perspective - where people would typically marry very young (often out of college), and no one would even think of having sex without at least being engaged.<p>I don't doubt the truth of this story (though there is certainly hyperbole); rather I find it hard to believe that 
'sleep with' in this context actually means 'sex'.  The main flags are A) Feynman is discussing with other people about it (afaik not acceptable socially then) and B) a sexual one-night stand would be even less so.<p>Finally I wager that the teen birth rate drop is solely due to an increase in education and contraption (and even legalized abortions).  Obviously, there were some teenagers having sex in the 1940s (with a much higher liklihood of becoming pregnant right now), but, due to the risks and less acceptance than now, the rate was lower.",1268794461

1197587,story,,,14,20,rufugee,"Ask HN: Is anyone doing any significant work with the play framework?",,"Guys,<p>Long time Java and Ruby guy here. Most recently have spent much of my time with Rails, which I really enjoy...most of the time. However, I find it infuriating at times to read through some of the code of the framework itself...the magic(tm) of ruby simply makes it difficult to trace at times. To boot, none, and I mean none (including RubyMine) of the available IDEs do a great job of ruby source navigation. They're at times adequate, but a far cry of the capabilities Java IDEs give you.<p>Four months ago, someone posted a link to playframework.org. I glanced it over, half interested but wary of picking up and learning yet another half-assed attempt at copying Rails to the Java world (I'm looking at you, Grails). However, earlier this week, something made me think of it, and having some spare time, I downloaded it and walked through the tutorial.<p>I am blown away.<p>play! supports just about every feature I can think of that I find so appealing in Rails, but it does so in Java. The code is clean. The project seems mature. The layout of a project is almost identical to a Rails project, so it's very easy for a Rails developer like me to grok. It will generate project files for Eclipse, Netbeans, Textmate and Intellij on command. It will walk your dog and make love to your wife, while finishing up the yard work you've recently neglected. Ok, that might be a stretch, but you get the idea.<p>The only thing I find missing is not really a problem with play! but rather a limitation of Java...I am completely, totally addicted to Ruby's blocks. I love being able to collection.each{|one|} over lists...it just feels right.<p>That said, play!'s clean code and style make Java palatable again, and the speed is fast(!). It's the first time I've been excited about Java development in a long time. I'm really surprised the buzz around it has been rather quiet. I think it's a Java web development game changer.<p>So, sorry about the blathering, but I'm curious...are any other HN'ers using play? If so, what's your experience been so far? Have you run into any limitations that would cause you to steer others away from it? Have you deployed to production yet?<p>Please share your experience or thoughts on play, if you don't mind.<p>Thanks.",1268794335

Being in the industry and meeting/knowing numerous professional bodybuilders the reality is JUICE. Natural growth is a rare phenomenon unless you are deficient in myostatin. Or first time weight lifters  can achieve noticeable increases in mass but the drop off rate is huge and maintenance is nearly impossible. Every physical body that you see and say ohh man I wish I looked like that is probably a product of steroid use.I'm not talking about Brad Pitt in fight club because thats just a function of low bodyfat (even then he could have took a cutter like winstrol or anavar, who knows with hollywood. Go talk to the 300 cast about juice) The silly thing is a lot of people do not know they may have used steroids. For the past 12-15 years many supplements marked as pro-hormones (think andro, poor mark mcgwire) were sold as legal products and once the slow ass FDA catches on it gets added to the wonderful reference book of anabolic steroids. Many legal supplements are still in the pipeline and on their way over to the illegal garbage bin. Another reason why following bodybuilders is pointless b/c the workouts they throw in Flex magazine are too difficult and can result in over-training for the average/normal person.<p>ultimately its about incentives. The fitness industry is a SHAM. Most supplements will not work unless they are some form of endogenous test. Creatine what a joke.<p>At the end of all this I am not promoting living a non-healthy life style. There are wonderful benefits to moderate cardio and low calorie diets.<p>I can go on and on and on. But I just hate not having the truth out there and the whole world fooled.<p>Lyle mcdonald at www.bodyrecomposition.com is the real deal. The guy has great advice and he is a no nonsense dude. The only thing we disagree on is natural growth. I feel as if his assumptions for growth are too high. www.steroidology.com is another great site for users and non. I work with a few natural folks and some add 20 lbs but it is not that noticeable (b/c its never pure lean body mass). The only way to naturally mimic roid effects is through protein timing which has a 1% success rate.<p>Reality is, what you want to look like is impossible. If you want to shed 20 lbs of fat sure thats doable naturally but achieving a sick looking fitness cover body requires 250 mgs of test to the upper right glute area twice a week.

Slacker.  ;)  Sorry, Japanese salaryman humor.<p>I honestly was trying to write a blog post about this last night and just couldn't sustain the mental effort required to make a good job of it.  So I stopped and will take a run on it another day.  That is, ironically, one of my tips.<p>Design your business to have smaller batch sizes.  If, for example, you typically ship software every 2 work-weeks (~80 hours), you might take two months of work on your current schedule between shipping events.  That can feel like staring out to the horizon and still not seeing the finish line -- it is depressing.  Instead, if you were making visible progress <i>every single night</i> you sat down, then you'd be happier and might find that you have much larger reserves of energy.<p>Relatedly: cut scope, cut scope, cut scope.  The less you need to write, the less you need to test and the less you need to maintain.  Every line of code you write is an implicit claim on your time every day from here to eternity, ensuring that that code doesn't break.  Try to write as few time-debts into your life as possible.<p>Process and systems: time invested in making yourself more efficient is some of the best time you'll ever spend.  Systems which work without your personal intervention -- for example, any sort of self-help option for customers that resolves a common support issue, or automation of recurring tasks like backups, etc -- are worth their weight in gold.  Formalized processes which turn ""Sit down at the computer for an hour and bang out something that might or might not work"" into ""Follow the freaking checklist and have something which absolutely will not break in 27 minutes"" save you time and sanity.  (If you think you're tired now, wait until the system goes down at 3 AM and you have work in 4 hours.)<p>Mix tasks which require your personal attention with those which require calendar time, so that you can fire one of the longer tasks off, go away for a week (Saturday through Saturday), and then come back and see what happened.  A/B tests work great for this.  So does certain flavors working with freelancers, if you're working with the right ones and have a habit of giving them sufficient direction in advance.  (Hold on to anybody who can work without constant direction -- they're worth their weight in gold.)<p>I have found that exercise, church, and social activities are all net-positives in terms of the amount of work I can get done, simply because feeling like I'm actually living tends to improve my physical and mental energy levels.  By comparison, TV/games are generally a net negative.  Adjust appropriately for things which matter to you.<p>If you want to work, and you feel like you can't work, try doing another flavor of task.  Planning on programming but can't?  Go work on e.g. marketing or drafting the newsletter or what have you.  If you still can't work, <i>clock out</i>.
