I doubt many would find that to be enough. I wouldn’t. And I’m not even all that ambitious.<p>I think a basic income can create very strong incentives to make at least some additional money compared to traditional social security. There is no need to find a job that pays at least $1300 in order to make it worthwhile, for one (you get to keep your basic income no matter how much you make – minus taxes, so this is in a way not always true).<p>I would even think that something like a basic income is especially nice if you want to become self-employed.<p>(There would be higher taxes, probably much higher in the US, a little higher in Europe, but I – being one of those liberal Europeans – have no problem with that.)<p>I’m still kind of on the fence when it comes to basic income, though.

1157792,comment,1157093,1157499,0,0,DenisM,,,"I should have made it clear - I was talking specifically about reducing economical risk by turning over your fate to a slave owner. The elevated risk to personal security is obviously a downside as you pointed out, although a sane slave-owner will never kill you because he has already paid for all your future work. In addition slave will forever forgo all chances of climbing out of that hole because he does not keep any of the surplus product he has generated. And hence my point is that someone seeking to reduce their exposure to risk can easily end up subjecting himself to a different risk he didn't think about.<p>The parallel with employment is direct - by trading your economic liberty for a paycheck you are reducing your exposure to risk of there being nothing to eat. However you are also eliminating your exposure to the upside of your work. You are also picking up the risk of having loaded on debt and then being laid off, ending up in a dead-end career and work-place hazards.<p>What Seth points out is that risk of there being nothing to eat is vastly exaggerated in our minds, thus many of us trade the very real upside of our labor for the risk-protection we didn't need.",1267404492

Of course, it's foolish to equate every pirated copy as lost sale (as the RIAA/MPAA do), but I do believe many titles lose a respectable number of sales through piracy.<p>It is important to ensure that any anti-piracy measure that affect gameplay can be identified as such and not as bugs. This can be difficult to do in the game since providing messages/warnings gives crackers a place to begin backtracking, so at least on my games we would carefully seed FAQs message/boards with questions/answers that if X occurred it was because you were running a pirated copy.<p>As a developer my bigger concern, both at the time and ongoing, is ensuring that any demo we release is produced in a manner that's both expedient and forward looking. If you go back 5+ years it was fairly standard for developers to release demos way in advance of a retail release - infact far enough in advance that it was possible to make changes to the final game based on feedback/metrics from the demo version.<p>This practice now seems to have all but died. Many games never release a demo, and games that do have a demo version often wait until after the retail version hits the shops to release it. I think that's a real shame and driven largely by fear of possibly bad press for games that need to recoup multi-million dollar investments.",1267404314

For example, if you buy an S&P 500 index fund, you are <i>not</i> indexing the stock market. You're just indexing a bunch of blue-chip US stocks, and you don't have exposure to asset classes such as bonds, small cap equity or foreign equity.<p>If you will need the money in 3-6 years you should not put it in the stock market. If you want to fund an early retirement then there are a lot more variables into this equation that you do not seem to take into consideration. What is ""early""? How much money will you need into retirement? What other source of income besides savings will you have during retirement? Do you intend to raise a family? Etc. It is impossible for anyone to answer these questions for you. This is why you <i>should</i> learn about the stock market, and about personal investing in general, if you want to make informed decisions about making your money work for you.<p>I very strongly suggest that you read ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" by Burton Malkiel.",1267402331

For example, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund offers stocks across all industries and includes growth and value companies from domestic and international, large, mid, and small-cap companies. That's pretty darn diverse, but it only covers stock. To really diversify, you may want to purchase a bond index as well.<p>I use Vanguard. Vanguard has some of the lowest cost index funds. The only downside is they all have $3000 (or more) initial limits. Oh and there are generally no transaction costs with Vanguard, so you could do $100 a month via direct deposit and personally incur no fees.",1267402252

As soon as a user downloads one of these hosted libraries (by visiting a site that calls for it), their cache is primed for every other relying site they visit.""<p>It depends on the CDN and what cache information it returns. I'm not going through all the links and verifying that they all return correctly. I do recall Yahoo's YUI documentation page promising the use of far-future Expires which means that the browser very likely never even hits the CDN, but nothing stops the CDN from using E-Tags instead, which is still pretty fast but does manifest as a hit on the CDN they could track. That said, it's entirely possible that every link there uses far-future Expires.<p>Personally, I'd just grab the file and use far-future Expires myself. If you've got a web application that uses code that way, odds are this is not going to be your bottleneck anyhow; far-future Expires just as thoroughly fails to hit your server as it fails to hit the CDN.",1267402026

I think translation prices are artificially high, because the translations companies became entrenched before the internet connected everyone.<p>I managed to get translations done for about .025/word, and then get the translation edited at the same price. This is  total of .05/word, which is way way less than the average translation company that can charge anywhere from .25-.75/word.<p>And, you ask, how do I know these are good translations? Well, besides checking out the work with people I trusted, I also know they are good because my iPhone app went from unknown to top 20 ranked in many countries - I had big improvements in downloads, rankings, and revenue. The translations more than paid for themselves in the first couple of days.<p>The most successful so far was the Chinese. My app is now the 2nd most downloaded free navigation app in China, and it's top 10 paid. Before translation, we never had a single sale.<p>EDIT: I went ahead and posted some charts and graphs from my own experience: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1157824"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1157824</a>",1267401885
