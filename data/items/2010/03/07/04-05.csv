(I don't know if this has been fixed -- as I said, it was a few years ago that I ran into this issue.)",1267937805

1172892,comment,1172765,1172833,0,0,viraptor,,,"One point was mentioned - recompiling time may be huge.<p>On the other hand - if the recompile time is tiny, I don't bother with any specific order, I just fix what I see as trivial first. But when you see the clang's very verbose errors - how many can you fit on the screen? 10? 15? To make sure none of the last ones depend on some code guessing, you'd have to scroll to the top every time, instead of just fixing what you see.<p>I'm still not a fan of guessing - badly reported error is still better than properly reported error on a nonexisting code (potentially incorrectly guessed).",1267937661
1172891,comment,1172765,1172814,0,0,koenigdavidmj,,,"It's quite common and accepted for compilers to make assumptions about the rest of the code, and for those to be wrong if your code is broken.<p>For example, the C# compiler has a large number of passes, and it will do no more passes after seeing an a previous pass. Thus, you might knock a file down to one error, fix that error, and then find that you have a couple dozen more errors.",1267937630

The reason Google is taking over the world is that when Big Brand Advertiser's outsourced advertising firm gets slick-talked into spending six figures on a single page advertisement in Vogue, nobody has a bleeping clue whether that particular advertisement actually advanced business goals or not.  Spend six figures on AdWords driving folks to your landing page, though, and you can track the ROI fairly accurately.",1267937556

This isn't a technology problem, it's a ""why pay for what you can get for free"" problem.

1172864,comment,1172803,1172803,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I just finished Genji Monogatari, a work from 12th Century Japan. It follows Prince Genji from being born to an low ranking concubine of the Emperor and follows his adventures, and how he gets exiled, and returns, and eventually becomes Emperor himself. Very interesting read.<p>Anyway, at one point in the book, he meets a family in the countryside where the mother had died and the father was working off in another city, leaving one last elderly grandparent in the care of a 10 year old girl. Genji took her, raised her, and she became a member of his household. About 10 years later, after Genji's wife died, he actually married her.<p>Anyway, it'd be totally politically untenable to loosen the adoption restrictions, and going as far as to allow adoptive parents to compensate the family would never happen. It'd be just politically impossible due to perceptions involved, and maybe that's a good thing. Still, infanticide is no good, and I wonder if there's other solutions if we could broaden our perspective.",1267935671

I know quite a few business men and women (especially in sales) who would pay a good amount monthly to have this as a tool at their disposal. If you need a concrete example, I'd highly recommend reading Keith Ferrazi's ""Never Eat Alone"", where he discusses how he manually enters all his contacts and reminders after each and every conversation to remind him to follow up and ""ping"" people. (Actually I'd say everyone should read that book in general)<p>Personal CRM is a hugely untapped market imo. CRM solutions exist in a thousand ways from salesforce and competitors, but they really don't deal with the ""personal"" aspect of relationships very well.<p>So in terms of growth I think they're fine. In terms of exits, I can't really speculate, but I think there's at least two really obvious ones (acquired by Google and integrated into Gmail / Google Apps / etc...., or acquired by salesforce or a related competitor)",1267935590

In fact J.K. Rowling talked about her mad rush to just finish the first Potter book before returning to full time employment as a teacher, when there would be no time to write. It's interesting to me the people who tend to create the higher value things, artists in one form or another, are usually fairly poor.
