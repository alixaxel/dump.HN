Some inventions were truly amazing insights, where if the inventor hadn't come up with them, the world would probably have been without that invention for decades, if it ever got it. But many inventors essentially anticipate history by only a few months or even weeks: they get to an idea that, given progress on subsidiary technologies, was getting to the point where it was obvious to anyone in the field, but they get there <i>just</i> ever-so-slightly earlier than everyone else, so win the race, but don't really change history much as a result.",1267930470

The central concept was that publishers would receive offers via our advertising marketplace, and then use their own selection algorithm to select ads to display (publishers could choose to use our hosted selection tools, use our open-source selection algorithms, or build their own).  This would allow the publisher to use any combination of factors, such as ad format and perceived relevance -- not just eCPM.  It is a flexible system that give the publisher the final decision to display or veto an ad.<p>If anyone wants to read the whitepaper, feel free to send me an email.

Then they'll surely want to shell out cash for my products!""<p>The problem is, after seeing a few of these, I'm not going to spend time weeding out the good from the bad: it's like junk mail, after awhile it's just thrown away, and it doesn't even matter anymore if there might be a hidden gem.<p>I can only assume that a scam is being pulled: that there are ad managers who create annoying systems to meet artificial quotas, and then show their employers how many ""millions of clicks or page views"" they received.  That way, they can demand huge sums of money for all the ""exposure""; in reality, I'd be surprised if the ads do much good.  If a site is ""dying"", it's not because visitors block ads, it's because companies are falling for the scam and paying advertisers who are essentially being offensive and misleading about their numbers.<p>Here are examples of effective ads:<p>- Hulu, because they made reasonable compromises to respect visitors.

When I go to my parents' house and watch TV ads there, I find them ridiculous and wonder how anyone could take them seriously.  Then I realize that most people watching them don't even notice, so their brains must be somehow conditioned by watching them.  That's the part that disturbs me the most.<p>I don't agree with everything in your blog post, though it was an interesting read, thank you.  Specifically, I don't run an adblocker, but for most sites I don't seem to even notice the ads.  I'm not sure if that's because I'm conditioned to see them as normal, or because I'm just not seeing them.  I would hazard a guess that their impact is much less than TV ads though.<p>Regardless, I do sympathize with people who run websites that offer useful information or services, but don't have a viable revenue model that doesn't involve ads.  I get a lot of value from these sorts of sites (for instance, the sites of open source software projects), but there are too many of them for me to want to pay a subscription to all of them.  (Perhaps there's an opportunity there?)  However, most of these sites that I get the most value out of are not about screwing money out of people, just paying for their hosting costs.<p>To compare this with TV, I generally don't want what's on TV, even if I can download it for free, but I do want the content on many of the sites supported by advertising.

I've been waiting for etacts to finish importing whatever it is importing for almost 6 hours, and with no ETA / status bar / email update I'm inclined to feel that it's either not working, is heavily bottle necked, or something went wrong<p>3. Assuming the system is actually just busy doing all the processing on my emails, as an end user I would prefer it to do all this in the background, in a manner that is oblivious to me.<p>4. This means you could/should display 'incomplete' information, as long as it comes with the warning of 'We've still got XXXXXX emails to process' or something similar :)<p>I really just wanted to see what the interface/experience is like, regardless of exactly how much information you've processed (i.e. I'm ok with seeing a 'last contacted 3 years ago' message, even though I contacted them yesterday, because I realize you're still processing the information, but I want to see it now, not five hours from now :)<p>You do a great job at a very simple one-click login/signup, but having to wait forever to use this will (imo) lose a lot of people down the road who just ""want to try it"" (one of the best quotable comments I've heard a few weeks ago was from one of the founders of BackType -- ""Your biggest enemy is the back button"")<p>Anyway, I do look forward to using it asap :D",1267927851
