That is, that most Web designers don't get the respect or autonomy they deserve (or, perhaps, they don't <i>command</i> it.) If I get a plumber round to fix something, I'm not going to tell them what parts to use, what brand of pipes I like, or insist on them using outdated concepts. I trust them to do the work. Most people are that way.<p>With Web designers (and designers in general, really), people think that since they can see the surface of the finished product, they have as much insight into what works visually as the designer does. This is not true and this ignorance is very hard to work around. There are some good clients out there, but the ""bad"" ones are just worth ditching IMHO.",1267999150

It's optimized for being able to compile really huge projects in a tractable amount of time, not being able to recompile individual files in the shortest possible amount of time.  The latter will execute quickly enough (yes, it only recompiles what you've changed), but the startup time is still annoying enough to want to batch up edits.",1267996286

They then put a ""Classifieds"" link on desired pages, that takes you to another page filled with targeted advertising relevant to the article or site as a whole. As a bonus, let the content providers have an opportunity to select or vote on ads to reward quality and improve relevancy. The classifieds page doesn't even need to come from the referring site, as it is completely separate from the content. If advertising is so wonderful, this model can't fail. It's less intrusive and encourages the advertising industry to provide something of value.",1267996086
