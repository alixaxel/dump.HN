1230719,comment,1229528,1230321,0,0,Retric,,,"Humans are domesticated relative to our ancestors / closest primate relatives.  Anyway, I suspect the reason domestication works so fast is it's breaking down a chemical pathway which is fairly simple relative to creating a new sequence.  Most young animals are minimally aggressive as baby's and it's only after they start to grow that they become aggressive. So just about any mutation effecting that transition sequence and they stay as infants.",1270000744

It is different from all the software/website task managers mentioned here.  You can think of it as a meta-organization tool.  A org software factory if you will.  You can customize it to exactly how you want your thoughts, tasks, notes, etc organized.<p>See <a href=""http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html</a> for an idea of the sheer breadth of options available to make it work exactly for you.<p>This may sound like a lot of work, but there are a lot of sensible defaults, which is why most org-mode tutorials that scratch the surface make it seem like a sibling to other task management software.  The base case the OP wants would simply be:<p><pre><code>  S-M-<RET>: create new TODO
  C-c C-t D: mark TODO as DONE
</code></pre>

The fact that you can scale the relational model using Oracle's software, with or without a support contract or appropriate tuning measures, is sufficient evidence to invalidate the claim that many make that the relational model does not scale.<p>The relational model != ACID. The relational model != SQL. The relational model has nothing in it implicitly that ruins it's ability to obey CAP. You are right, that you will have to make some consistency tradeoffs to get partition tolerance. Again, to repeat, this has nothing to do with the relational model itself, just with the CAP theorem.<p>Just because it is <i>hard</i> to build a RDBMS that loosens ACID but scales and is much easier to build a ad-hoc non-formally-defined model like that seen in Cassandra or BigTable does not mean it is impossible. You simply have to pay for it, in software, hardware, and consulting fees.<p>Nothing is stopping the open source world from making PostgreSQL or MySQL scale out other than time, energy, and perhaps a seminal paper or two out of acadamic that provide foundational models that are necessary to implement it correctly.

I added syntax highlighting in TextMate.  I also wrote Ruby scripts that automate any parts that would be tedious if done manually.  My calendar is just a glorified text file, specially formatted for ease-of-use.<p>I also wrote my own TextMate bundle that turns TextMate into a wiki, which is my exobrain.<p>Finally, whatever you end up doing, I would recommend doing something similar to my ""jot"" script.  Basically, whenever I have an idea or come across something I want to address later, I hit F10, a dialog appears, I type my thought into the text box and hit enter, and then the message is saved in a file called jot.txt.  At the end of the day I clean out my jot.txt.  This allows me to capture ideas as they come to me without breaking my momentum of what I'm currently working on.

If you export furniture, do you assume it is built using screws, and measure the country's added value by subtracting the value of the screws from the value of the furniture? Or maybe you believe it is glued, but actually uses screws - now you have overvalued.<p>And what if you import another, more expensive kind of screw from Japan, which looks identical but has different properties? Do you know which ones are being exported, and therefore what value the country is actually adding? And to think this is only a simple example!",1269997511
