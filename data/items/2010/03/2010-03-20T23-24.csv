Google's early webserver was a dozen or so source files that looked vaguely like Tornado, except that instead of having all those webframeworkey goodness like regexp-based dispatch rules and templates, it would just issue ""prints"" on the file descriptor for the user's connection.<p>If you want to write a database from scratch, you should start with some sort of basic persistent key/value store.  Then give your values a column-like substructure.  Then figure out how to index it.  Then figure out how to index it based on multiple columns.  Then figure out how to handle joins and sorts.  Then slap an SQL parser on top of it, and you'll have something similar to MySQL c. late 1990s.  Then endure all the laughs as people say you're not a ""real"" database, and put in 10 years of incremental improvements while you add transactions, and better SQL compliance, and query optimizers, and wire protocols, and replication, and clustering, and all that stuff.",1269128437

(the hour), right now I did few jobs (only 2) ($30/hour for a small job at Odesk and $120 for a 2 hours task). Last week, I got a request from a company to review and rewrite (some technical papers) for them.

M.I.T students are getting an average $20/hour for programming (http://web.mit.edu/sfs/jobs/wage_guide.html); so I thought $25 will be good considering my age and qualifications (no qualification rather than a small portfolio and apps I made). Also average freelance workers (freelance sites like Odesk) is $10.<p>So am I underestimating my capabilities? How can I measure my rate? If age doesn't matter, how can I evaluate my experience and charge accordingly to the market rates.<p>I fixed my rate for that job; but it seems that another startup may be interested on some JavaScript debugging (as I have similar experience to their issue, some event bubbling).

Which doesn't seem like a feature to me ... having a too-small display and having to scroll a lot has <i>always</i> been really unpleasant in my experience: using remote desktop to connect from a small display even to one that's only moderately larger always gives this uncomfortable feeling (perhaps not unlike claustrophobia?) of being in a cramped space and always being partially blind to your surroundings. Additionally, one naturally tries to keep a ""full size map"" in one's head, which is a lot of extra cognitive load.<p>I believe this effect is mitigated when most/all of the offscreen elements are just more instances of the same type of thing as those already shown (example: repeating table views), and also when the offscreen portion of the elements are along a single axis only (i.e. you would only have to lengthen the device in a single direction to be able to see everything at once). Somehow this type of scrolling doesn't cause the same ""looking through a keyhole"" response in me.<p>Many of Palm's advertisements for webOS portray a similar effect (screens tapering into offside infinity on either side of the device) which seems to me likewise unattractive and poorly considered, though the actual experience of the device doesn't appear to be like that, and certainly isn't <i>designed around it as a feature</i> like WP7S is.

You can make a template (choose text and background colors as well as the background image) for your site <i>and</i> throw in tweets as well. No, its nothing complicated. Yes, it can generate apps from a template. No, it is not just an RSS reader for a single site.<p><i>TechCrunch even spoke about this: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/07/apple-cookie-cutter-apps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/07/apple-cookie-cutter-apps</a> .</i><p>Two weeks ago is a far cry from <i>NOW, as in TODAY and YESTERDAY</i>. And it could be argued that it is different from the type of applications that the link you pasted mentions; twitter integration, maybe more options for the template as well? I never looked at the ""old"" way of generating apps.<p>And in the TechCrunch article, it does seem to imply that templates are OK, as long as they do more than simply RSS.",1269126418

I'm using Quartus II Web Edition. Altera finally came out with a Linux version, which is nice of them, but the list of annoyances is long:<p>1. Incremental compilation is disabled. You'll wait at least 5 minutes to try each change.<p>2. The signal analyzer is disabled. Debugging is a pain.<p>3. The source code for the supplied Altera components is encrypted.<p>4. Your design is on a timer, and stops working 1 hour after being programmed into the board. There goes that hobby project.<p>This is for the trial version, which I supposedly would use to learn. Yet they make learning about as painful as possible. I simply don't have 3 grand for the full version of Quartus.<p>I can't comment on Xilinx or Lattice, but I suspect the story is similar. FPGAs are hostile to hobbyists.<p>Oh yeah, boards :) Get a full-featured dev board. Sparkfun has simple breakout boards, but you have to add your own power, clock source and flash for storing the FPGA config, at least, before you can do any work.",1269126301

Nice.<p>I've got to say, both in CS/hacking and math, I find myself spending a lot of time carrying out computations to get a feel for a problem. I poke around a problem until an answer begins to form in my mind - enough evidence pointing me in one direction heavily sways my opinion and even approach to solving a problem. But is computation <i>math</i>?<p>I suppose it's purely semantic, but I still see a difference between hackin' away at a problem and finding an irrefutable proof of a problem; though often the former leads to the latter.<p>As a NB, I'd like to add that Mathematica can be used to do ""pure"" mathematics, too.",1269126256
