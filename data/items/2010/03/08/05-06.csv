1174763,comment,1174575,1174575,0,0,pmiller2,,,"As an experienced LaTeX user, I was less impressed with how good LaTeX did than the spectacular results he was able to get out of Word and Writer.  It isn't that LaTeX failed to impress (it did) -- I was just amazed at how much better the Word and Writer versions looked than the defaults.<p>Also, his characterization of LaTeX as nothing more than ""a set of finely tuned defaults"" is absolutely correct.  Generally speaking, one wants to think hard before starting to twiddle too much with the default settings in LaTeX, mostly because Knuth already did, and it shows.  One also doesn't want to get caught up in the trap of paying more attention to formatting than the text, which is easy to do when using WYSIWYG environments.  There's a good reason that the smallest unit of ""finely tuned defaults"" available in LaTeX is the documentclass -- because producing <i>documents</i> is ultimately what it's all about, not formatting text.",1268027485

1174754,story,,,2,0,shanley,"Cloud APIs, Vital and Strategic? Or Geeky, Unused and Anemic ",http://wattersjames.posterous.com/cloud-apis-vital-and-strategic-or-geeky-unuse-4,"This week no fewer than four people I respect in the cloud ecosystem cautioned me not to get to enraptured with cloud APIs. The argument was similar across their critiques: lots of talk about them, very little buying through them, they are interesting for geeks and obscure outside that circle.<p>I was shocked--but my shock in itself was alarming to me. Am I over rotated on the broad platform characteristics of cloud computing? Are cloud infrastructure services more valuable as a complete resource management applications than as modular horizontal platforms?<p>The argument against API centrality, as far as I can surmise goes something like this:<p><pre><code>    Chill on the API love fest man. What really matters are the core functions of resource management, provisioning and user management. What's really new about the cloud isn't an API, we've had those, its the standardization and control of server and network resources en mass. Also, wake up, most people are going to consume whatever prescriptive GUI framework the cloud provider puts forth and be happy. Customers of XYZ big hosters are going to pay far more for a portal experience than an API. \n</code></pre>\nHere is my critique back:<p><pre><code>   1. A buyer, is not always just a buyer. Say 90% of cloud resource 'buyers' use a non API method of consuming resources. This doesn't refute the importance of the API. See reason #2.\n   2. Innovation happens elsewhere. Twitter knows this well. Do you use Twitter or do you use Tweetdeck on the Twitter platform? Assuming you follow the logic of the resource, network and user management argument above--it actually should create more incentives to open up an ecosystem of potential consumption and integration methods. The cost of creativity gap between a large organization, and a lean entrepreneur to create value ad above the core provisioning management system is vastly different. Twitter is a relatively simple distributed messaging system; the possibilities in infrastructure and data services are even greater. \n   3. Heroku, Engine Yard, JungleDisk, Storsimple; these are not just alternative management and control GUI's, they fundamentally ad another layer of real value. They are early examples of #2--and these are very early days. \n   4. If you are really pursuing a managed hosting offering where the customer is more interested in the service relationship than the platform automation and compatibility the API may definitely be less relevant. The managed hosting marketing is also orders of magnitude larger than the current cloud infrastructure market; however, none of that means the attributes of the managed hosting market = the cloud infrastructure market. They are juxtaposed but separate along key strategic axes. \n   5. Smart buyers with long term vision care about the API story for all of the above reasons. It is a necessary but not sufficient aspect of the offering to them--but again bad logic to confuse sufficiency with necessity. \n</code></pre>\n*<p>The question behind the question has to do with the strategic nature of cloud infrastructure services in the long term. Are they a corner case deployment, a hackers liberation sandbox with some interesting but limited mutations, or the fundamental platform of the future?<p>I have opinions there :)",1268026970

My rationale is that, if <i>all</i> functions are written that way, it's less cognitive load when reading them. All variables used are known at the beginning, and once I've digested that, I can think about the code that will be working with them. These days, if I'm reading a function and a new variable is declared partway in, I feel like I've been ambushed with a new thing that makes it harder to understand.<p>That said, I tend to write such short functions that it's never an issue. If a particular variable isn't needed until halfway into the function, that's a good sign to me that it needs to be broken into two or more smaller functions.",1268026618

Another is cache locality of your stack, if you are in a language or project where that matters; by creating space on the stack as late in the game as possible, your stack access pattern tends more to the end of the stack than if you declare everything up top in no particular order.  This is a really small micro-optimization though; the main point is that you want to know what type something is and what might have been passed to its constructor, on the screen at the same time as the code that uses it.<p>Another thought; if there is a mammoth difference between top-of-function and narrowest-scope-possible, that suggests that you may have very large functions, and might consider refactoring so that the difference between your method and his is small?",1268024445
