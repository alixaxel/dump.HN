It's not so much a departure from relational databases (they were never really there), but a return to <i>MySQL</i> basics, w/out the SQL.",1269741571

1224080,comment,1222912,1222912,0,0,derefr,,,"This occurred to me when I took my first college psych course, and we were talking about ""operational stages."" The whole lecture was about how kids can't work with disconnected mental abstractions until they reach a certain level of cognitive development (the Formal Operational Stage.) It was also enforced that moving between stages of cognitive development just takes <i>time</i>, not more or better prerequisite education. In that light, it's kind of obvious that young children shouldn't be being taught math, any more than they should be being taught first-order logic.",1269741460

It has resources that can both ""listen"" and ""notify,"" just like in the Puppet example given, and things are executed in dependency order unless execution is specified as ""immediate.""<p>I agree with the point about Chef's Rails-oriented deployment. It's a little frustrating having to negate the default Rails settings while doing a PHP deployment.<p>To me, the major downsides to Chef are quirks/instability as changes are made during active development, and somewhat sketchy documentation in places. Still a great system though.<p>(Also: check out the reply from Adam Jacob, lead dev of Chef, in the comments. I noticed this after posting here.)",1269741304

You need a locking mechanism - which you'll probably implement using (wrapped) native syscalls. Not only does that break cross-platform operation, you'll also have to work on and fix (but find first, of course) bugs in the locking implementation. As you spend more and more time on this and your app starts growing, you'll find yourself spending more and more time working with the limitations of the filesystem you're using (file size limits, directory size limits, access times for files in large directories). You can hack your way around all that but then you have to face other critical tasks. Say .. backup and restore procedures. Can you do partial backup/restore operations? No? Well, get ready to write code for that too. And you preferably want to be able to do those live. Remember those locking issues you solved when you started down this road to hell? Yeah, they're back with a vengeance now.<p>How about a full restore? Maybe you should have implemented a replay-able log system to get that full restore up to speed with the state of the db since the time of the last backup.<p>Or maybe this isn't exactly the right point at which to re-invent the wheel :)",1269740686
