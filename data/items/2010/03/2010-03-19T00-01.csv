It would be the most beautiful chaos that I would ever witness in my lifetime.<p>It would be creative destruction at its finest. It is to destroy a  fundamental belief that is pervasive in the heart and minds of the masses and showing people that what they thought was their security, was their downfall. Thousand of engineers, artists, and all kind of entrepreneurs thrown into the street left to fend for themselves overnight.<p>I guess the threat isn't credible, because it come from the rambling mouth of a high schooler who probably want free musics.

1203005,comment,1202591,1202971,0,0,trominos,,,"That isn't the Poincare Conjecture at all... you're asking, essentially, whether a smooth, connected, finite surface has a single local minimum that's also an absolute minimum. That's not a hard question.<p>The Poincare Conjecture postulates that if any loop on a ""nice"" surface can be shrunk to a point, it's topologically equivalent to a sphere. (""Nice"" here means connected, finite, and without a boundary -- like a sphere or pyramid, but not a disk or infinite plane.) For instance, if the conjecture is true, a cube is topologically equivalent to a sphere, because if you draw a loop on it you can always shrink it down to a point; but a torus (donut) isn't, because a loop around a vertical cross-section can't be shrunk.<p>Perelman proved the conjecture for three-dimensional surfaces (which are the boundaries of four-dimensional objects).",1268960387

I like push notifications as an idea, but I'm not wild about Apple's implementation, especially since there's nowhere you can go to get a list of notifications you've gotten, so if you get one, then you get another before seeing the first one, it's just gone. (A few of Apple's decisions, like not putting a simple ""Notifications"" listing app, baffle me.)<p>One thing about the app/site: the workflow for getting started sucks. I have to go to your website, make an account, and then go to the app to put that info in. To add to the effect, the only signup link on the homepage is all the way at the bottom, and creating my account doesn't automatically log me in.<p>Plenty of apps give you the option to register an account right in the app, and yours should be one of them.

1202994,comment,1202462,1202462,0,0,Daniel_Newby,,,"The prime numbers have nothing to do with predators.  Predators require regular feeding from live prey.  A prey species that hides for even one year causes significant starvation in predators that could otherwise come to depend on it.  This effect is maximized after only a handful of years of hiding.  No lizard or bird could survive on stored fat for more than one or two years.<p>The prime numbers come from competition between strains of cicadas.  First consider that genetic timers are not perfect:  most cicadas may emerge after N years, but a fraction will emerge in N-1, N+1, or even farther years due to randomness in genetics and the environment.  By blind chance, occasionally an early group will become plentiful, causing a predator population boom that smashes the population of the ""correct"" year.  It's like a badly-made gear that occasionally jumps one tooth forward.<p>Second consider what such jumping does to strains that are not relatively prime, such as 6 and 12 year cicadas.  Eventually the random chance effect will synchronize them so that they emerge in the same year.  Because these year skipping cicadas all evolved from the same parent species, they will be closely related.  This creates a cross-mating problem if they emerge at the same time, causing matings to either produce no offspring, or to produce hybrids that are synchronized with neither period.  There may also be problems with excess damage to the host plants.  Therefore evolution favors strains that synchronize as infrequently as possible.  That means prime numbers.<p>IIRC a few years back some scientists created a simulation with plausible numbers for fertility and hybrids, and the result was spontaneous emergence of the prime number periods for the observed strains of cicadas.<p>Edited for clarity.",1268959932

Particularly if (like me) you're approved by the hiring committee and then a hiring freeze puts your application in limbo for the better part of a year.<p>However I didn't see the insulting bit of it.  I really didn't.<p>When I think hard about it I do note that they ask some basic CS questions that many people forget the answers to.  And people tend to avoid cognitive dissonance by finding excuses for their failings.  So certainly some people walk away (as the grandparent poster did) upset that they are asked questions which are ""below"" them.  Someone who has done this may become insulted at being asked questions.<p>But focus on the critical facts.  The questions are asked because they are relevant to Google.  When you operate at Google's scale, having people with good gut instincts about scalability matters.  Most software developers don't develop that.

He apparently talked the owner into letting him take over the dead accounts as part of his duties on the condition that he get a cut.  The owner expected them to be uncollectable, so he figured there was nothing to lose.<p>My dad would go personally see these people, learn where they lived, learn what day of the month they got their check (often, a welfare check).  On that day, he would show up with enough money to cash their check and take out a small payment on the debt they owed.  (He swore that if you went even one day later, you weren't going to get a dime.)  He was very friendly about it and offered to cash it for their ""convenience"".  He made it an offer they could not refuse.<p>My dad supposedly collected on upwards of 90% of what the business was owed by these dead accounts, taking his cut, of course.",1268959811

Basically, within Google we haven't noticed any of the problems around our hiring practices enough to solve them.<p>The problems are clear; unfocused interview loops leading to poor feedback, much too long process between phone screen and receiving approval from MTV, a focus on hiring those good at interviewing and not those good at engineering (hiring scores do not correlate with performance scores), and ignoring experience by offering salaries or positions significantly below candidate's current levels in the industry.<p>We end up being a place which is great for college hires and those getting their first chance, e.g. moving from test to dev, but not for experienced hires.

(In contrast, when my two siblings got divorced, their spouses made attempts on their lives.)<p>* As of last summer, I am drug free, having gotten off about 8 or 9 prescription drugs and then gotten off the OTC drugs that replaced them.<p>* I genuinely like men, as friends and lovers, in spite of having the kind of childhood that tends to produce women with multiple personality disorder.<p>* I am the one who decided to get divorced, not my husband, even though I was deathly ill at the time and had been a homemaker almost my entire adult life.<p>* Now that I am basically well for the first time in my life, I think my best years are ahead of me, not behind me.

We're pretty good as justifying most of the things we do within mental models we make of ourselves. However, the reality is that often our actions are driven primarily by external forces.
