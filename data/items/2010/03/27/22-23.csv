Developers are driven to the quality of the environment and the subsequent quality of the products that they'll be making.<p>I work mostly in the enterprises realm where it's easy to see that the baseline ""quality"" of the ecosystem (mostly Microsoft, but also other related stuff) affects the quality of the the products built around it.<p>A quick glance at the products built around the Apple ecosystem shows a stark difference.  Ever since I started bringing my Mac to work (since the switch to the Intel processor), the difference has been even more obvious to me.<p>I think that in this instance, open vs. closed is a means to an end.  If people never had any problems with how Microsoft stuff worked, then no one would have been griping about their stuff being closed.  And since Apple stuff is generally pretty good, people are willing to forgo the ""closed"" ecosystem since they are getting what they need out of it.<p>I also think that the closed nature of Apple's ecosystem is a little overstated.  For instance: it's true that the iPhone app store has pretty draconian policies, but on the other hand, nobody has to truly go through it to get an app onto the iPhone.  They could just make a web app.  However, people choose to create native iPhone apps because they work better.  But then again, they probably work better because Apple tends to enforce their strict policies.",1269730589

Both are concerned with creating objects, but a builder is also concerned with the assembling of the object. This is a relatively subtle but pretty noticeable difference. Telling someone you are using a ""builder pattern"" should immediately ring a bell in their heads saying, ""oh, it’s not just a factory"".<p>Patterns are specific nomenclature not implementation.",1269730515

On the other hand, that sort of ends-focused argument isn't a very good reason for any actual women to go into the field, unless they're particularly altruistic and doing it to better society.<p>But yeah, I think these debates do tend to assume that STEM careers are desirable, which is why there is no similar hand-wringing about how few women get construction jobs (<10% women). Certainly they're <i>well paid</i>, which is probably the biggest reason STEM careers are seen as better than construction jobs, given that level of pay has become close to an exclusive measure of job desirability (e.g. we judge colleges and majors by average starting pay on graduation).",1269729393

And the iPad supports 802.11n, so you'll be able to get a decent range with a pretty cheap router. Definitely enough to cover your house and yard.<p><i>The $500 model also has 16GB of storage, and I have no idea if that's a lot or a little. Since 64GB is available I assume 16GB is not much.</i><p>The size of a movie won't change if you have a 16 or 64GB iPad. And as with everything else, if its enough space or not depends on what you use it for. Personally, 8GB is more than enough space for me, on my iPod touch (and 16GB on my Pre is excessive for what I need). So, I preordered a 16GB iPad.<p>The availability of a greater size doesn't change the amount of information a smaller size can hold. 16GB is 16GB, regardless of the existence of a 64GB model. It just that there are different sizes that cost different amounts of money.<p><i>Total Price: $1000.
