That said...<p>Overall, I think it's pretty neat and not too far off what I've been thinking about doing for a in-browser templating language. I think you could get the syntax looking cleaner if you were to model it after one of the Python TALs, e.g. Genshi [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://genshi.edgewall.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genshi.edgewall.org/</a><p>It'd look something like:<p><pre><code>    <tr class=""content-row"">\n        <td style=""text-align:left;"">\n            <a href=""${link|'#'}"" yt:content=""title"">Atlantis</a>\n        </td>\n        <td yt:content=""status.queuenum"">-</td>\n        <td yt:content=""status.progress"">\n            <div class=""bar_container"">\n                <div class=""bar_inner""></div>\n            </div>\n        </td>\n        <td><span yt:replace=""date"">03/10/2010</span></td> <!-- using replace just to show it -->\n    </tr>\n</code></pre>\nI'm particularly fond of having filter functions in a templating language (number formatting, whitespace stripping, etc), so I've switched to my preferred string interpolation sequence and tossed in `|` as the filter separator and the single quoted string as the default when the data is null or undefined (sytax comes from jsontemplate). If you wanted to keep the complete separation, copying mustache's `{{variable}}` syntax wouldn't hurt. I'd suggest that yt:content/replace leave their values alone when null/undefined.<p>Finally, I'm confused about why remove is part of the language. In the similar languages I've worked with, it's called 'when' and takes a boolean so that you can do simple branching.",1269283994

1210990,comment,1210138,1210885,0,0,geebee,,,"My problem with the short term solution is that it interferes with the market correction that could bring more Americans back into engineering.<p>If engineering is more difficult and pays less, than you'd expect a shortage.  Markets will correct this shortage naturally, since bidding wars will emerge for the smaller number of qualified engineers, wages will rise, and people who would otherwise do law or medicine would look at engineering with more interest.  Unfortunately, if you allow industry-specific immigration (or worse, guest worker) programs, this market correction will never occur.  This is a big part of why many people who are not opposed to immigration in general take a very dim view of the H1B  (keep in mind that Milton Friedman (not exactly a guy who advocates ""reducing immigration for the express purpose of not unduly expanding the labor pool"" was a critic of the H1B program for this very reason).  It's not that it expands the labor pool, it's that it does it in a very uneven way.  You're essentially saying ""we'll let you in here to do engineering, but not to do, say, law.""  This amounts to a government program designed to discourage Americans from studying engineering and get them into law school instead.<p>While most fields aren't nearly as closed off to ""new Americans who may look a little different and have a funny last name"" as law is, there mere absence of a widespread visa program can have a similar effect.  So you'd also expect this program to encourage Americans who might otherwise have studied engineering to become real estate agents, mortgage brokers, nurses, and physical therapists.<p>I don't like to hear people say ""dey took our jawbs"", but I think it's very legitimate to ask ""why did the government set up a system where engineering (and a few other) jobs were the only ones they were allowed to take?""<p>Especially when independent, objective research like the RAND study suggests that engineering isn't experiencing any kind of labor shortage.<p>BTW, there is one final factor here, which may explain what is going on.  Many jobs are lucrative to the person doing them without producing much wealth.  Engineering is generally the opposite - produces great amounts of wealth, but not always lucrative for the practitioner.  To over simplify, a tax lawyer who saves a client a million doesn't produce a million in wealth, but he'll be paid by his client as if he had.  An engineer generally does produce this wealth.  So society, in general, has more interest in producing engineers than individuals have in becoming engineers.  So I suppose the US has decided to resolve this by seeing if we can lure away someone else's engineers.  That way, we can be lawyers, real estate agents, and so forth, and still have someone producing the wealth that the rest of us get to divvy up.  As long as you ban those new people from taking anything other than an engineering job, and you don't mind watching Americans abandon the field in large numbers, should be fine, right?<p>Well, wait until we can't get engineers from overseas, and need to suddenly revive a profession that we essentially destroyed through policy.  I actually think this could end very badly, which is often the case with the unintended consequences that occur when you regulate markets unevenly.  I think that in the long run, these programs could create a severe shortage that will be very damaging.",1269282711

You may never actually be asked such a puzzle; but since the vast majority of interviews are non-technical pageants, it ""signals"" some confidence and that you ""get"" what position the interviewer's in.<p>I've been asked twice to solve out-of-interview puzzles, and once an in-interview puzzle. In each case, I asked for other people's (anonymized) solutions/times. In both cases, this was with Common Lisp using companies. Your experience may differ, but:<p>* Everyone else took shortcuts in out-of-interview puzzles. Most wrote almost no comments (a couple had overly chatty ones), nor was the code packaged in an easy-to-run way. Even most good solutions would cut a corner by (for instance) assuming that the input was magically pre-parsed from strings into symbols.<p>So, there'd be a couple of good-but-somewhat-unpolished answers, a few which were visually messy and over-simplified the problem, a couple where it wasn't really solved and the programmer maybe apologetically produced a best-attempt, and one which wasn't even in a known programming language. (The last one deserves the most sympathy, as he/she almost certainly had mental problems.)<p>In contrast, imagining that everyone else was a hyper-professional Programmer O' Doom, I packaged it all with ASDF (including instructions) and polished it as if, say, generations of island-stranded maintenance programmers would use my solutions to figure out where to sit in order to not be eaten by a cannibal.<p>One thing that probably goes over well is to point out a possible problem with a part of your code -- and a justification. Like a comment saying, ""Note: Some Lisp implementations don't perform tail-call optimization. However, for real-world inputs, they would nevertheless suffice and be more maintainable than alternatives.""<p>* People are human, and often have problems with in-interview puzzles. Part of my mind mysteriously blanked for a short while when asked what I felt was a trivial question -- permute a list of 3 elements (performance irrelevant, run the solution in Common Lisp). My imaginary Programmer O' Doom no doubt typed it from finger-memory in seconds, after whimsically sketching a solution where she randomly permuted the elements until enough unique ones were uncovered, or enumerated them all at read-time or something.<p>So, I stammered out an apology because I took a few minutes, jarred and ready to crawl into a hole for being unmasked as a fraud. Well, it turns out that the previously fastest solution took over an hour. (Of course I remained a fraud, albeit a still-unmasked one...)<p>Maybe it helps to think of such interview puzzles as a symptom of society's diseased way of working; then there is less stress. They're fundamentally mindless and people often derive an elitist thing from them; it's hard not to.

Companies offering help with that include Flurry (disclosure: that one's partially mine), Motally, Mobclix, Medialets, and Localytics.  Pricing is generally free with the companies making money off of additional, primarily ad-related services.  Or you can just roll your own.<p>However, measuring conversions from marketing campaigns is still brutal, when it's possible at all - it's very difficult to buy installs profitably at volume.  And the 'big killer' statement is largely accurate, although I've seen higher-priced niche applications grow more like your business did.",1269281171

The screen is nice, but I apply a Skinomi plastic skin to any phone so it's all the same to me. The keyboard's not bad, better by far than a virtual one, but it's not really good like a Treo or Blackberry either. The battery/usb compartment door is hilariously shoddy. No idea how that one got in the finished product.<p>There are some great things about it too though, like the slider up top to mute the phone (standard Palm feature). And whatever flaws it may have with hardware are made up for tenfold by the Touchstone. As far as user experience goes, that simple item makes phone ownership so much better than you'd intuitively think. Before I got it I thought ""do I really need to spend money on something that makes me not have to plug my phone in once a day? How hard is that really?"" Now I think I'd gag if I ever had to plug a phone in again.<p>But really, the joy of using that OS is worth almost anything. I can't really explain it other than to compare it to owning a Lexus. It's a total experience that's greater than the sum of its parts.",1269280942
