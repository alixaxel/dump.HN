1190290,comment,1189682,1189799,0,0,nkassis,,,"Which is sad since HTC has been making very good phones even before the whole iPhone craze started. Their windows mobile phones were by far the best in my view before the iPhone came. (I never owned a Windows Mobile HTC but have had experiences with a few of them through friends). HTC seemed to work hard on creating better interfaces for the Windows Mobile platform and it does so again with Android. Their sense UI is quite nice and I believe has many things that put it above the iPhone. The widgets on the home screen they provide are awesome.",1268542621

""Milk at Dawn + 30 minutes"" because that's when the animals are ready.  (Substitute actual optimal time for milking for ""Dawn + 30 minutes"".)<p>It's unfortunate so much of our time at work is centered around meetings at particular times, otherwise we could all just ignore the machinations of the government, and just do stuff when it makes sense to each of us based on our own circadian rythm and the season.",1268542532

There is nothing like being in business as a training tool for being in business, though.  I don't think there is any grad school which will teach you, e.g., how to run an AdWords campaign or how to think about SEO, but these are fairly generalizable skills that I get to keep even if catastrophe strikes the teaching bingo market tomorrow.<p>Plus, as opposed to grad schools, businesses pay <i>you</i> while you learn.

I am also thinking about this as a research topic - independent summer study, to be more specific. I am hoping to give the matter some serious thought - why negative data is not considered valuable, what sorts of conditions would make it valuable, and how the framework of publishing should be, so that others can easily access, understand, and reason about the data. \nAre you interested in a subset of these? Do you know any resources on where to start thinking?

Similarly, I really like that it stays light out until 8:30 or 9 P.M. in the summer.<p>Yes, I'm a night owl, but I don't think there are many people who are more likely to benefit from sunlight at 4a than from sunlight at 8p.
