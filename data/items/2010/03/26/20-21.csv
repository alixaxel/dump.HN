1222056,comment,1221374,1221819,0,0,jcl,,,"Makes sense, but I'm not sure I like the way it's headed.  Scheme is so named due to a Lisp system called Planner.  ""Scheme"" and ""Planner"" (and, I suppose, ""Gambit"") have mostly neutral connotations.  ""Swindle"", ""Larceny"", ""Heist"", and now ""Racket"" are obviously criminal.<p>It's not a good direction, PR-wise.  You end up with people having to justify to their bosses why they want to use something called Racket for work, or justifying to parents why their kids are learning Racket in schools.<p>(And then there's the inevitable analogy: Python : Pythonista :: Racket : Racketeer)",1269637129

The base approach of the relational model is that there is a professional DBA who makes sure that the mission-critical data is available in a format that multiple applications and multiple department can use directly (the type of data is know but the ordering isn't set). Thus DBA is ""hat"" that most programmers can't ""wear"", especially since a large portion of programmers don't understand the relational model.<p>On the other hand, Nosql and object-databases allow a programmer to just stuff data into the a data-store without worrying about a cohesive datamodel. <i>If</i> we consider this as mission-critical data that multiple departments of a large organization would want to see in multiple forms, then we can find many ways that the approach of <i>""just save this array of values""</i> produces serious problems.<p>But there are many applications where these problems don't appear.
