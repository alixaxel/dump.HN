1) people who did not go to stanford/mit/etc. (if you went to those schools and you can't get a meeting with Sequoia, or anyone you want, you don't know what you are doing and should not be an entrepreneur.)
2) first time entrepreneurs who are age 24 and under and thus, do not know what they are doing as entrepreneurs. And thus need guidance.<p>for both of those subgroups of people, it makes a lot of sense.<p>ironically, you can only get into ycombinator if you went to stanford or other top university.  hahaha... this will get refuted big time by the one or two cases where it is not true; but I'm sure it is largely true.",1268625473

It reads like a cross between ""Chicken Soup"" and ""Dr. Seuss"".<p>Examples: the book is 288 pages but only 30,000 words; every other page is an illustration, and most pages are only 3/4 full; footnotes are rare, and usually reference some pop-biz online piece from Forbes or BusinessWeek.<p>The final chapter (on culture) was very good. It's a topic that doesn't require any rigor to be effective. But the rest of the book was actually one of the more disappointing reads of the last 12 months.<p>Edit: I'm sorry this is so negative. I really like 37sigs and Jason in particular. Maybe I had too high expectations?",1268622833

I think ycombinator is great and all.  But to make it in this cruel world as a startup founder, you need to be arrogant enough to be able to say $25,000 is not worth 5% of my company.  To be honest, if you are not disciplined enough to moonlight and work on your startup and give away zero equity and actually earn the $6,000 it takes to live on for a few months to then quit your job and build your idea full time, you probably shouldn't start a startup in the first place.
no, I have not made it yet; but I'm damn sure I'm right about the above.

Also, as trains become more popular, they will eventually become subject to the same security hassles as air travel.<p>So I'm not directly contradicting you. Trains will always be more spacious and allow more freedom to move about and dine in comfort than planes. I think they have a definite role to fill (any trip between 100 miles and 600 miles in length assuming decent speeds of 150mph+). I'm just saying the future is going to be a heterogeneous mix of transportation options.<p>Of course, if someone builds a train that moves at jet speeds, all bets are off.",1268622088
