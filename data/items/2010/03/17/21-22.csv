It's not a huge application, probably around 300 hours of work.<p>Coming from a framework stack of WebWork/Struts2, Spring and Hibernate, it's a total breath of fresh air.

The error messages are almost always enough to show you straight away where the problem is.<p>The only downside is that it completely shuns the entire Servlet API (although I appreciate that this is where a lot of the simplicity comes from). As a result you cant leverage any servlet-based components. But maybe that's a good thing.<p>I'm seriously impressed.
