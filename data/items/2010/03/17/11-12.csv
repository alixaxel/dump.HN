All things being equal the the study suggests  a significant advantage for higher intake.<p>Here are my best guesses in order of likelyhood<p>- The benefit is temporary and relates more to the raising of levels rather the absolute level.<p>- The amounts of creatine involved (equivalent of 2 pounds red meat per day) are too much for anyone to ingest naturally for long, but this level is required to see significant benefits.<p>- The benefits of creatine are being counteracted by some other substances in red meat therefore masking it's effect on heavy meat eaters.<p>- The reported high average IQ of those who chose to become vegetarians masks the fact that the lack of creatine in their diet does actually make them dumber.<p>Anyway it looks interesting especially for those without much natural creatine intake.",1268825096

If you deliver it completely normal, as if you couldn't possibly imagine it could be offensive, then most likely they will just start by laughing it off or throwing some test in your face, expecting you to fall apart.<p>If you show you can handle what they throw back at you, you've both demonstrated confidence, that you're the kind of guy that <i>expects</i> women to fall over themselves to sleep with you and so you really are honest and can say what you like, <i>and</i> you've made it clear to them from the start that you're after sex; you're ""dangerous"", not some potential guy to amuse them while they have a few drinks.<p>Sexual intent, confidence and the <i>perception</i> that you're very successful with women and don't need to by shy about what you're after means far more than looks.<p>Personally I'd expect that line to work better on ""good quality"" girls, actually.

Judging by the absence of a location bar and settings menu this appears to be more of a demo than a pre-release application preview. This is very disappointing when measured against MS's other previews, betas, etc. (Windows betas and RCs, Visual Studio CTPs, even previous IE betas) and outright pathetic compared to, say, Chrome's dev-channel releases (which are release quality by the standards of this industry).<p>Speed was unimpressive on my system compared to Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Acid3 performance was also unimpressive as I had to force IE9 document mode via the debug menu in order to achieve even a score of 39. One of the important aspects of the acid tests is that the browser be in the default configuration when visiting the test page. Just because there's some magical ""improve standards compliance"" button on IE doesn't mean that the browsing experience for everyday users will increase, somehow every other browser manages this problem just fine, yet IE always struggles with it. Perhaps they'll fix it by release, if we're lucky.<p>The supported features are refreshing but nothing that multiple other browsers haven't supported for a while.<p>Once again IE is trying to play catch-up and once again they are doing so slower than the other browsers are pulling ahead. It's good to see IE improving its feature-set, standards compliance, and performance, but at this point IE9 is racing the clock against irrelevancy. By the time IE9 is released its implementation of several years old technology may seem quaint.",1268824000
