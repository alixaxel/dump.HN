I didn't learn to justify eliminating the rights of ""minors"" for their age alone, like most people seem to.  And, more to the point, I never ""got used"" to waking up before 7 am in school, because you don't get used to sleep deprivation.  You just get less and less healthy.<p>Was I perfectly responsible with my sleep time, doing of homework, etc., in school?  Of course not.  No one was.  But that fact doesn't disprove that it's very difficult for most teenagers to follow the sleep schedule that American schools impose on them, and not just because they like to stay up late.",1269212341

Do residents perform more poorly at the end of a shift on various tests of coordination and perhaps even judgment? I will concede that the answer is almost certainly, ""Yes."" Nevertheless, the evidence also suggests a tradeoff between medical errors due to sleep deprivation, and errors due to patient handoffs. Although there is now a big push for reducing resident duty hours and/or imposing ""naptime"" requirements, I suspect that will only make the dangers of handoffs even more evident and costly. Were I to be a patient, I would rather have a tired resident performing my surgery or drafting my treatment plan than a fresh resident who doesn't know me.",1269212333

1208783,comment,1208206,1208735,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I'm not sure I understand. I'm saying specifically that at the very least, this one feature of classical inheritance is <i>not easy</i> to implement and in fact almost always leads to bugs when people try to do it. The truth is that most of the interesting features of classical inheritance are pretty hard to implement:<p>1. super, as described above<p>2. private, protected, etc. Never seen this work in js with inheritance<p>3. inheriting class methods as well as instance methods<p>If all you care about is the most superficial copying of a superclass' methods, then yeah of course its easy to do in JS, its essentially just prototypal inheritance again. Its arguably just as easy to implement this watered down form of classical inheritance in C as well (or in any language I guess):<p>struct MySubclass
{
struct MySuperclass base;
int newMember;
}<p>I don't think this is necessarily an argument for elegance however.<p>The point is, if these are features that everyone has to implement, then at some point you have to say ""maybe its not that <i>everyone</i> else is stupid and doesn't get it, but that its an actually worthwhile feature"". In fact, they predicted this (which is why class and super are reserved words in JS despite not doing anything), and its supposedly expected to come in the <i>next</i> iteration of JS (as in, the one after the one currently not even implemented yet). So, in 50 years when we get that we'll finally have remedied this issue.",1269212214

In a language with classes developers are used to ""this"" being an instance of the current class, and this expectation creates a consfusion in JavaScript. If you don't look at it through the prism of classes, the rule for ""this"" is pretty simple: ""this"" is the receiver. Create a function, apply it to any object, and that object will be the receiver available as ""this"". It's that simple. Now the only confusion left is who's the receiver. In ""foo.bar()"" like cases it's obvious, and the only remaining case (if you don't count the discouraged ""with"" statement) is ""bar()"" which calls a function on the global object (like in Python).",1269211286

It has good authorization controls on chat rooms and access to transcripts. It associates uploaded files to transcripts, and has very good UI for finding files across transcripts. Finally, it has a solid HTTP API, which we've used to put chatbots for commits and such on channels. I recommend it.",1269209906
