Machin and Pekkarinen (19) reported that the M:F VR in mathematics was significantly >1.00 at the P < 0.05 level among 15-year-old students in 34 of 40 countries participating in the 2003 PISA and among 13-year-old students in 33 of 50 countries participating in the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). However, these data also indicated that the math VR was significantly less than or insignificantly different from 1.00 for some of the countries that participated in these assessments (e.g., Table 2), a finding inconsistent with the Greater Male Variability Hypothesis.<p>...<p>Similarly, Penner's cross-nation analysis of the 1995 TIMSS data (20) showed that the proportion of girls scoring above the 95th percentile positively and significantly correlated with several measures of female equality and status, including equity in educational opportunities and representation in the labor force and political offices.<p>Best I could find in 5 minutes<p>Consequences in High School and College of Sex Differences in Mathematical Reasoning Ability: A Longitudinal Perspective
Camilla Persson Benbow and Julian C. Stanley 
The Johns Hopkins University<p>Between 1972 and 1974 the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) identified over 2,000 7th and 8th graders who scored as well as a national sample of 11th and 12th grade females on the College Board’s Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) Mathematics or Verbal tests. A substantial sex difference in mathematical reasoning ability was found (Benbow & Stanley, 1980b, 1981). The consequences and development of this sex difference over the following 5 years were investigated longitudinally. Over 91 percent (1,996 out of 2,188 SMPY students) participated. This study established that the sex difference persisted over several years and was related to subsequent sex differences in mathematics achievement. The sex difference in mathematics did not reflect differential mathematics course taking. The abilities of males developed more rapidly than those of females. Sex differences favoring males were found in participation in mathematics, performance on the SAT-M, and taking of and performance on mathematics achievement and Advanced Placement Program examinations. SMPY females received better grades in their mathematics courses than SMPY males did. Few significant sex differences were found in attitudes toward mathematics.<p>Here's a visualisation (I think) of the male/female ratios of various IQs you'd expect given the different variances

We're looking for people who like to beat the system.</i><p>Naturally, beating the system requires some form of deception (some degrees of lieing, cheating, dishonesty). The ""system"" was setup in a way to obviously prevent that, which is why it exists in the first place. I know it doesn't necessarily make you an unethical or a bad person if you beat a system. But someone reviewing my previous application made a good point that PG puts a lot of value in the ""Don't be evil"" mantra, and said that our hack the system examples were shady. So I thought about trying to balance the amount of shadiness with the amount of beating the system-ness. (To be clear, one answer was getting around a library system to fake returning a lost library book in the 6th grade. Another was bait and switch trade technique to get items in Diablo 2. Not super evil stuff, we were kids and had to be creative.)<p>Now I don't want this to be a discussion about what I wrote, I just wanted to provide context for my question.

1197672,comment,1197617,1197617,0,0,jacquesm,,,"> Turing is so revered that the most coveted prize in computer science, the A. M. Turing Award, was named after him. It is worth noting that Turing’s sexual inclinations and religious convictions did little to diminish his notoriety. Homosexual and atheist movements around the world have wasted not time in transforming the man into a martyr and the sad history of his life into a veritable cause célèbre. The end result is that nothing negative may be said about Turing.<p>Dragging Alan Turings reputation in to a technical argument is really bad form.<p>I guess I'm proving the authors assertion to some extent, but I'm quite sure that nobody ever got scolded for a solid critique of Turings work <i>because</i> he was a homosexual. That's a pretty weird thing to say.<p>> I am free to bash Turing and his supporters to my heart’s content.<p>Yes, you are, but it makes no sense to bash the person, an argument should state what you have to say about the mans work.<p>> In fairness to Turing, my criticism is directed mostly toward those who have turned the man into the infallible god that he never was and never claimed to be.<p>Right... so that's two full paragraphs now of personal attacks.<p>> The Turing machine cannot be said to be universal because it is a strictly sequential machine by definition whereas the universe is inherently parallel.<p>Someone mis-understands the meaning of the word 'universal' in the 'universal Turing machine'.<p>Don't miss the introduction to the second part:<p>> If what I write about Alan Turing offends you, then don’t read my stuff. It’s not meant for you. And don’t send me emails to tell me that you don't like it because I don’t care. If I am a kook in your opinion, you are an idiot in mine.<p>Says that guy writing this on a device that probably wouldn't even have existed if it hadn't been for the person he maligns.<p>> I have touched on this before in my seminal work on software reliability but I would like to elaborate on it a little to make my point. The computing model that I am proposing is based on an idealized machine that I call the Universal Behaving Machine or UBM for short. It assumes that a computer is a behaving machine that senses and reacts to changes in its environment.<p>And I'm not allowed to call this guy a kook...<p>> I think that all the major problems of the computer industry can be attributed to the elitism and intransigence that is rampant in the scientific community. The peer review system is partly to blame. It is a control mechanism that keeps outsiders at bay.<p>I've heard that exact sentence before I think, it was in the context of some guy claiming that he could extract zero point energy from spinning magnets, he had it working but was too busy to demonstrate it, in spite of being offered a healthy sum of money.<p>> With the parallel programming crisis in full swing, the computer industry desperately needs a Kuhnian revolution. There is no stopping it. Many reactionaries will fight it teeth and nails but they will fall by the wayside. We are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Turing madness. I say, good riddance.<p>Indeed.<p>What a load of tripe.<p>The Von-Neumann bottleneck is indeed a problem, and there are quite a few people (Sutherland, and, surprisingly, a number of HN'ers) busy in trying to find a way to deal with this.<p>Whether or not anything like that will ever supercede the Turing 'engine' of computing remains to be seen, for now it seems we will end up with some kind of computing fabric, where each cell is a minimal computational element, and where the cells together will perform computations comparable to the ones we run today on our von-Neumann bottle-necked computers.<p>But we will still speak of those machines as Turing complete, simply because that is the yardstick by which we measure computation, the ability of a computational device to simulate every other computational device, no matter how inefficient.<p>Whatever will happen, I'm fairly sure that this guy that tries to make sullying someones name into a platform for his own tripe will not be a part of it.",1268797007
