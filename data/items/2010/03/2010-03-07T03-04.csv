An impression spent on me has absolutely <i>zero</i> chance of ever generating any revenue or any other kind of value. This is a safe assumption that has held true in my decade or so of browsing the web. The impressions that I block are spent on someone else, where they have at least the potential to lead to conversions. Thus, I am helping the advertiser make more money.<p>The ones who lose out in this situation are the middle men: the agencies, networks and content providers. Though their impressions become more valuable, they have less of them to sell and this apparently works out to a loss. However, appealing to my sympathy about this is nonsensical. <i>They are simply asking me to help them sell worthless impressions to some third party</i>. I would never feel inclined to do that, no matter how indebted I felt to the content provider.<p>Ad supported sites who complain about blocking fail to see the big picture. Their entitled thinking goes no further than ""when you do this, I get money, so you should/must do this"".<p>If internet advertising is not sustainable in the face of ad blocking, then it is not sustainable at all.<p>Incidentally, asking me to actively avoid sites who's ads I don't plan to view is also absurd.
