1229434,comment,1229145,1229145,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Wow. Considering PHP is used primarily for generating HTML, UTF-8 is the de-facto standard encoding for unicode on the web, and PHP files are usually ASCII or UTF-8, going for UTF-16 seems like a phenomenally bad idea. I can see how UTF-16 looked promising back when it was still UCS-2 and there were no surrogate pairs. These days though, UTF-8 and maybe UTF-32 seem to be the realistic choices when working from scratch; UTF-32's advantage in some areas is probably too weak to make it a real contender unless your strings are literally linked lists, not codepoint arrays.

1229411,comment,1229015,1229015,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"I'll follow up with you on this by email, probably tomorrow night when I have time, but I think the quest for money is based on 5 stages:<p>1. Basic needs: food, housing, essential security, and the ability to procreate (which means the ability to afford housing in which it's possible to raise children, and to pay for their education).<p>2. Leisure: books, music, sports, travel, sexuality, the freedom to choose more interesting work.<p>3. Comfort and time: maids, doormen, business-class air travel, professional autonomy, and other provisions to make life a lot less annoying.<p>4. Social status: expensive art, trophy real estate, invitations to (and the ability to throw) ridiculous parties, five-star hotels, private jets, AmEx black cards.<p>5. Power: this is the level of the rich people who have no strong political drive but run for political office (Forbes, and to a lesser extent Romney) or otherwise strive for influence.<p>I differentiate the last two levels because the 5th is usually observed in billionaires who don't have to answer to anyone, nor to prove themselves, so they tend not to care about social status <i>per se</i> (it comes to them) but still strive for high levels of power and influence.<p>Achieving #1 is so difficult in our society (due to the outrageous prices of housing anywhere worth living, plus healthcare and education) that a lot of people bypass it and shoot for #2; this is the ""hipster"" movement-- young people who are rich at level 2 but poor at level 1 (because it's impossible for them to achieve security). It's relatively easy to be happy on a low income if you don't plan on having kids and actually can, unlike most people who are just aping a cliche, ""live in the moment"" instead of worrying about healthcare, family (in the future) and retirement. Whether this is reckless or enlightened is a matter of opinion.<p>Money is happiness-producing at levels 1, 2, and most of 3. Where people get tied up and end up miserable, despite ridiculous levels of wealth and income, is when they end up chasing #4-5. These concerns can easily lead to overspending, ""golden handcuffs"", professional unhappiness, and general malaise, because it's not straightforward to ""buy"" social status, as nouveaux tend to find out the hard way. When people have their basic needs taken care of and choose to focus on social status in a major way, they become childlike.<p>However, what we take for granted, as elite technologists, is the possibility of filling out levels 1-3 (basics, leisure, comfort) without having to muck around in the bottomless need pit of #4 (social status). Except for very smart technologists and entrepreneurs, it's literally <i>impossible</i> to reach an income sufficient for level 3 (~100-400k, depending on geography and family size) without getting involved in the social status lemon party. We're lucky in that we don't have to.",1269964168

I threw out anything that had no sentimental or significant monetary value, and things I thought were ugly or junk.  I had very few things left -- all of my furniture was gone except for a chair, a desk and a lamp.  Most everything else fit in a trunk.  I had exactly a week's worth of clothes.  Some cookware, dinnerware and basic kitchen tools.  My girlfriend was livid, though honestly I found it a good excuse to break it off with her too.<p>Now when I look at something, I always ask myself - depending on what it is - how it will be 5 (for non-durables like clothes), 15 or 25 years from now.  Would I still want it after that time?  If not, there's no way I'd ever buy it.<p>So when you're an apartment with absolutely nothing, you learn what you can live without, and you develop a deeper appreciation for simple things like chairs.  You don't just go buy a new sofa, you lay on every sofa in the city until you find one that looks great, that you'd want to reupholster after 30 years and that you can fall asleep on near instantly.  You really examine how your clothes hold up over time because... honestly, you don't any spare shirts or pants around.  Simple things like plates... if they're ugly, you'll notice all the more.  If you don't have enough, you're not so bombarded by other things you're more aware that you seem to be cleaning them an awful lot.  Your place stays clean too.  A shirt on the floor in a sea of nothing is very much out of place.<p>You also don't... buy all that much anymore.  I have a bed and nighstands and lamps again.  And a dining table, chairs, sofa, coffee table and another lamp or two and my lounge chair... but that's been it aside from 5 or 6 articles of clothing and a pair of shoes in 3 years.<p>Now I'm sort of at a point - still in my 20s - where there really isn't anything I want to buy anymore.  Having been brought up by ""gotta-have-this""-trend parents, it's a very peculiar feeling.  Almost as if you feel lost.",1269964087

It doesn't sound like you're averse to working, and I'm guessing there is some work that you'd enjoy that would pay for your basic expenses.<p>I say this because I had a similar idea as you while in college (and I also had read Rand and loved the Fountainhead). So I studied economics and thought I'd do some business thing for awhile to make enough money to be free to do whatever I wanted to do.

And then as I began to explore careers, I began to talk to more people who chose to work for money and never really got away from that (and some of these people were getting ready to retire) and I realized my plan could be dangerous.<p>I started thinking about how short life was and decided to just go for something that interested me. So I decided to find a career where I could interview people. I tried to get a magazine internship, but couldn't find anything.

I applied and spent the next 7 years at that station (after working for 8 months for free, living at home and doing odd jobs on the side).<p>Maybe I just got lucky, but I am relieved that I didn't stick with my initial plan to make tons of money and then do what I wanted.

Drop the $200 or so for a copy of Burp Suite Pro.<p>Burp is the industry standard tool for testing web apps; probably more than half of all web app penetration testers use it. It's like Firefox Tamper Data on steroids; it gets between you and your request, breaks out all the parameters for you, and gives you tools to manipulate and replay the requests.<p>You in particular want to understand the Burp Intruder, which is Burp's fuzzer. The fuzzer takes a request, tries to figure out where all the parameters are (you can help it with that), and then feeds malicious inputs through them and records the responses.<p>You want to fuzz every page in your application at every code drop. We've seen entry level QA people trained to do this, so delegate the task if you're not sure you can make yourself do it reliably. You want to collect every error response, and you want to grab your application logs and look for every exception or abnormal event. You want to know how the responses are different from the last run each time you ship a new version of the app.<p>Burp is so extremely effective that I'm amazed every web dev team doesn't already have a copy. I think it's because it's billed as a ""security"" tool. But it's obviously more than that.<p>Webdevs have a lot to say about unit testing and cloud testing and integration testing and test-first development. What I can tell you is that I've seen no correlation between test methodology and pentest outcome. The TDD teams fall just as fast as the seat-of-the-pants teams. I want to strongly recommend that you don't waste time strategizing on how you'll test or validate architecture or whatever. Burp is a no-BS tool. Get it, run it, and you will find bad things. Work out your effective bill rate and the amount of time it takes you to adopt or extend a test suite, and it's the cheapest quality enhancer that's probably available to you. Do whatever you want on the testing side, but do Burp first.",1269963749

In most aspects of my life, I can be a pennypincher, but it was the one area that I felt like the experience was worth whatever pricetag. Then I started reading about the carbon emissions of flying (and the emissions of kerosene jet fuel) and I started re-evaluating. So I started to pick my trips more carefully and to try to fly less and stay longer if I could.<p>While at first it was an environmental consideration, now I'm realizing I'm actually happier without all the moving around. My husband calls it my family's ""pack-and-go"" mentality. I'm not saying everyone would be happier this way- as I definitely had my share of years exploring the world/my country a bit-, but for now, I like staying in one place a bit more. And the curious thing is, I doubt I would have discovered that if I hadn't thought about carbon footprint stuff. I mean, the ""pack-and-go"" mentality is a part of my family culture: I live in Spain, my sister lives in Sydney, another sibling lives in the South, another in Seattle, my parents in San Francisco, another is married to a Canadian... it's tough to avoid, but possible to cut down a bit I suppose.<p>And now that my income is drastically reduced from what it used to be, flying really isn't an option like it used to be either. So I am grateful that I don't feel the need to move about like I used to. Though, that's not to say, I don't fly. I live abroad so every year we take one trip home.

(The HN comments aren't in Verdana, at least on my system, so the previous quotes probably don't look bad).<p>* Verdana has a large x-height that requires extra leading, and each character is unusually wide compared to other faces. If you use Verdana then your properly-set document will be noticably larger in area. This makes it unusable when you need to show lots of information in a small area. It also reduces online readability somewhat, because it increases the amount of scrolling the user needs to do.<p>* Because of Verdana's unusual metrics, you cannot nicely mix it (inline) with anything except Tahoma, Georgia, and Consolas.<p>* Verdana doesn't implement all the dashes (en, em, minus, etc.) well. At least one of them is missing, and the ones that are there don't look that great. In particular, IIRC, the em-dash looks a lot like an en-dash, which is exactly what you don't want.<p>* Verdana only has lining figures; there are no old-style figures.<p>* It was designed for on-screen use, not for print use. IMO, the x-height and character width impairs readability on the printed page. (However, I remember some study that said that term papers printed in Georgia tended to get higher grades than those printed in Times New Roman, so...)<p>Microsoft's ClearType Font Collection (the C* fonts) are much better in almost every way that I can think of, including the above areas. The main problems I've found with the C* fonts are: (1) they don't mix well with the default Thai font on Windows which is bold like Verdana when ClearType is on, and (2) they don't mix well with Consolas, because Consolas has a similar x-height to Verdana, Tahoma, and Georgia.",1269961613
