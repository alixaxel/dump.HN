(the FSA protected some of the london banking sector against shorts which ended up helping them massively).<p>The truth is, it was a cascade of events, with a dozen or more senior players, all of whom could have changed things if took a different attitude.<p>Fuld (CEO, Lehman's) could have sold lehmans for more than it's worth now a handful of times, but held out for a bigger number (not because he was trying to self-enrich, but to make his staff richer: they all held stock and he was very much a company man);<p>Blankfein (CEO, GS) /Dimon (CEO, JP): could have given their trade partners (AIG, Lehman's) a break and not required them to post the majority of their capital reserve as collateral for their day-to-day;<p>Paulson, Bernanke et al: could have been less naive to think that the market would sort it out, and should have stood their ground and stepped in earlier with (ironically) less money, which would have facilitated liquidity sufficient to calm the market and let these banks deleverage the bad debt at a more acceptable pace;<p>Cox at the SEC: could have been less spineless.<p>Chris Flowers, Warren Buffet, others: could have been less picky and bought stuff, rather than requiring that the government go in with them on any deal they proposed without any backing or collateral.<p>etc etc.<p>there were (apparently) so many potential exit points for this thing, and well, the industry managed to grab defeat from the jaws of victory often - if only because it wasn't the 'right thing to do'.<p>a very good read for anyone who wants to get a good grasp of the timeline of all this is Aaron Ross Sorkin's <i>Too Big To Fail</i>. It's a rather fascinating expose into some of the inner meetings and conversations.<p>the tl;dr of it:<p>- everyone tried to buy/acquire/merge/whatever everyone else. Fuld literally tried to sell Lehman's to every single member of the big banks<p>- this thing could have been solved a half dozen times if it weren't for something quite simple/trivial<p>- it turns out that the UK Treasury eventually were the ones to crush the last minute save of Lehman's via Barclay's Capital. A deal was struck, ALL the big banks posted collateral to support Lehman's, and yet Darling at the British Treasury shut it down over a procedural issue in Barclays' company charter...

1188087,comment,1187953,1187953,0,0,ismarc,,,"The problem with monetizing dating-style sites is the same as trying to make money with health care.  Your system is at its best when people have one short trip and don't come back.  This lack of repeat use means that it has to work so phenominally well that success stories are regularly referring their friends, or you need a unique method to suck as much money over that time period as you can (not to sound bad about it, but it's the truth).<p>The ideal method would be to charge money upon ""success"", but there's no good way to measure a successful matchup.  Thinking about this...I think a reverse charge system may work (note, I haven't tried this and if you do go with it, be prepared for flaming fireball of doom, it's an off-the-cuff, not thought out idea, just top of the head thing).  Most sites seem to either charge a monthly fee, or they charge for communications.  Now, rather than charging someone money for TRYING to talk to someone, why not charge them based on people ACTUALLY responding.  Say, I have 5 message points.  I send a message to 10 people.  I still have 5 message points.  Let's say 3 respond.  I can use a message point to read each message, or I can just not read it.  If I don't have enough points to read a message, I only see that I received one.  Now, this should only count for messages that are from someone I sent a message to previously.<p>This way, initiating contact is free, and responding to initial contact is free for the contacted.  The lack of needing up-front costs to start trying to meet people is likely to drive people to sending that initial message, and if they get a response, they now need to spend money to read it...and it really is a response from the person, so they most likely really want to read it.",1268436881
