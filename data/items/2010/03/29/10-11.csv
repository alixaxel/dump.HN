1226261,comment,1226084,1226084,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"The problem that I have with your question is that I'm having trouble what you mean when you suggest you base pricing on ""number of users/questions"". What does that mean? To me, as a webmaster, I start thinking, ""Wait - do I have to know how many users are hitting my website or do they mean how many users can manage/edit the questions/answers?"" It's a bit confusing.<p>I'm going to assume that you are thinking along the lines of ""How many users the company appoints to edit/manage the entries."" Okay - if that's the case then what happens if a big company (like MSFT) decides to try you out on 10 pages that have 1-2 editors? You might get tens of thousands of hits but still get the same revenue that a one-person site with 1k uniques a month gets you. Can you scale that?<p>I don't know - it's a tough slope but I think you have to put something in there to prevent DOS to other clients because you are fulfilling one big client's requests ten-fold over the others.",1269860254

With his technique I can memorize really easily 20 words and still remember them days after. I never tried more but I'm sure I can do 50 words (I really have to try).<p>His technique :<p>1. okay first imagine that the list of words begins with ""telephone, sausage and monkey""<p>2. When you listen to the first word, imagine something grotesque with vivid colors and unscaled.\nFor a telephone just imagine an immense telephone, let's say a pink huge telephone.<p>3. When you hear the next word, imagine something in relation with the previous word. Like you need to use smelly sausage to type on the digital numbers.<p>4. Continue to do the same. Next word : ""A red monkey is eating saussage""",1269860227

But it's fair to assume at least 10% of the girls remember the brand name, and the remaining 90% will remember that for custom designed shoes they should go with ""whatever the brand was that got recommended by shinyrainbowprincess"". That's a lot of brand recognition.<p>But let's look at it from a cost perspective for a moment. I'm almost entirely sure that she got paid less than $10.000 for the advertisement. Probably way less, but what do I know? Suppose they did pay $10.000, then they only need to sell an extra 100 shoes or so to break even (assuming they have a healthy profit margin). That's peanuts, really.<p>So even if there are no direct conversions, and the only benefit is word of mouth or brand recognition the shoe shop still got a deal of a lifetime. Half a million people, that's half the circulation of the New York Times! And most people spend only 10 or so minutes on the paper, which is the same as the length of the advertisement.",1269858201

In Alan Turing's own words:<p><pre><code>    It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used\n    to compute any computable sequence. If this machine I is\n    supplied with a tape on the beginning of which is written the\n    S.D of some computing machine M, {242} then I will compute\n    the same sequence as M.\n</code></pre>\n(Alan Turing, 1936, On Computable Numbers, With An Application To The Entscheidungsproblem)<p>So it is no merely that the Universal Machine can read and execute programs, it is that it can read and executes programs to make itself equivalent to ANY other turing machine. Thus the Universal Turing machine is Turing Complete. As the amount of tape required to solve all computable programs is unbounded the Universal Turing machine must have an infinitely long tape.<p>It's usually worth going straight to the source where you can in CS, but much more so with Turing as his papers are so nice and easy to read :)",1269857592
