It could do this by pumping refrigerated water into the bottle and then extracting it again.<p>Finally, it rolls a label onto the outside of the bottle and fills it with a refreshing beverage.

1225522,comment,1225440,1225440,0,0,hristov,,,"Sorry, the parallels do not work that far. Listening to your customers as you go along is a great idea for a startup and a really terrible idea for a book. If you listen to your customers you are guaranteed to get a very mediocre book. A good book has to continually challenge and surprise the reader.<p>Imagine if Dostoevsky had listened to his customers when he wrote ""Notes from the Underground."" Most of the people reading the first couple of lines would say ""please change the main character."" By the way here are the first couple of lines:<p>""I am a sick man.... I am a spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased.""<p>So this would never have been written if Dostoevsky actually listened to his customers. And yet it is one of the best books ever written.<p>But releasing early and often is an interesting proposition for books. A lot of writers had to do that, because they published their books in serial fashion as they were writing them. Many other writers would continuously rewrite their drafts and would never release anything they had not completed and edited. And you can definitely notice when you are reading a book that a writer was writing and publishing it as he went along. But it is hard to say which one is better. The books that are published as they are written tend to be less organized and with less cohesive story arcs, but they can also be more original and pleasantly surprising.",1269823123

Pig + lipstick?""</i><p>The ""revolution"" is not that third-party modules are hosted on the Yahoo! CDN. That's been the case for a while now. The cool part is that in YUI 3.1.0, using third-party gallery modules is as easy as adding the module name to your YUI.use() call:<p><pre><code>  YUI().use('gallery-history-lite', function (Y) {\n    // Boom, I'm using the History Lite gallery module.\n  });\n</code></pre>\nThe real power here is not just that it's easy to use third-party modules, it's that it's easy to use third-party modules in conjunction with official modules, and YUI intelligently concatenates and loads them using combo-handled requests for optimal performance. And you don't need to worry about any of it.<p><i>""There is not a single snippet where YUI is less verbose. In every non-trivial snippet YUI is more verbose, often significantly so. The difference may seem small in these trivial snippets but it hints at what happens in real-world codebases: YUI complexity does pile up exponentially, not so with jQuery.""</i><p>You seem to be asserting that verbosity === complexity. This is untrue.<p>Where YUI 3 really shines is in large applications with many loosely-coupled components -- exactly the kinds of ""real-world codebases"" you mentioned. In these environments, YUI 3's modular architecture, flexibility, and consistency make it possible to keep your codebase maintainable while also ensuring optimal performance by allowing you to easily tailor the components loaded for a given page to suit the specific needs of that page, rather than having to load huge monolithic chunks of code that will never be executed.",1269821363
