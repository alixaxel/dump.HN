1226745,comment,1226409,1226641,0,0,swombat,,,"Plato was certainly smarter than both of us put together, but he also lived in a very different cultural landscape than we do. What books were available to young people then? Not many, I'd wager. The lack of suitable mass publication mechanisms certainly reduced the importance of literature. And the vast majority of the authors that I would think of as ""great"" had not been born yet. It is debatable whether a landscape devoid of mass publication means would still produce a healthy supply of great literature.<p>Since the printing press, we've had an explosion of amazing literature produced and distributed throughout the world. Many of the greatest thinkers of the last three centuries left their thoughts behind for us to build on. As an added bonus, many of them left those thoughts in highly entertaining forms that entertain and delight as much as they instruct.<p>It would really be looking the gift horse in the mouth to the extreme, to demand that impractical scientific studies be conducted to ""prove"" that humanity's great books make your life better.<p>Of course, we may have a difference of definition here. By ""escapist fiction"" I assume you included most fictional works, including such masters as Gabriel Garcia Marques, Herman Hesse and Jorge Luis Borghes, who definitely have the ability to transport one outside of the real world into that of imagination.",1269878314

To blow the preform into the bottle's final shape, it is reheated, and then air is forced into the preform, causing it to expand to fill the mold containing it.  The issue you would see with a bottle like this is that when the preform is reheated, the plastic in the wall tends to flow depending on the final shape.<p>When you have sharp corners, like those displayed, it is difficult to maintain an even wall thickness on the final bottle.  So you either have to use more plastic than you want to ensure a minimum wall thickness is kept, or risk having thin spots, which hurts the structural integrity of the bottle.<p>There is a reason that you don't see many square bottles.  The ones you do see, like Fiji, are really thick to account for this.  You can get away with thick bottles when you are charging $4 for a bottle of water.  Less so when charging a quarter that price for soda.",1269877912

And a grand total of 1 sales.<p>The click numbers were different though, the affiliate program I used reported lower click #s.<p>I'll make a proper blog post about this later today, since I've been waiting for the 24 hour window for reddit to finalize their numbers.<p>Edit: here is the post with all the numbers/screenshots. Surprisingly I had a lower CPM than Gabriel which is weird since he was spending a lot more money than me.<p><a href=""http://blog.styleguidance.com/post/481918228/tried-out-reddit-ads-here-are-the-results"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.styleguidance.com/post/481918228/tried-out-reddi...</a>",1269876192

But they're trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of hardware and licensing by limiting users' ability to run Solaris for free on beige boxes, and that does seem to tilt the odds in the open question of whether Oracle will continue to let OpenSolaris thrive, or whether they will marginalize it to maximize short-term profit.<p>I say short-term profit because, in taking this course, Oracle seems to forget that many of the part-time tinkerers and educational or small business users whom they've just priced out of Solaris will be the ones making ""enterprise"" purchasing decisions in the future.  This revised licensing agreement ensures that such users will be more comfortable and familiar with the competition instead--Linux, BSD, even Windows (Microsoft has done a fantastic job ensuring that their software is affordable in the education and small business sectors, while simultaneously maintaining a healthy profit margin in enterprise sales).",1269875629

1226642,comment,1226409,1226523,0,0,jcl,,,"I took a look at the paper, and that is not an unreasonable explanation...  It seems that the increased computer use did indeed reduce the time spent doing non-computer homework a bit, although the data is quite noisy and may not be statistically significant; TV viewing was similarly impacted.  But what really took a hit was <i>time spent reading recreationally</i>.  I can't help wonder what influence the reading had on grades relative to the homework.<p>Another thing in the paper that I found somewhat surprising was that slightly different parental rules had markedly different effects:<p><i>Interestingly, we \nfind evidence that the presence of parental rules regarding homework mitigate\nsome of the negative effects of winning a computer voucher without affecting the gains to computer\nskills and cognitive ability. On the other hand, the presence of rules regarding computer use reduce\nthe positive impacts on computer skills without improving academic achievement.</i><p><a href=""http://www.columbia.edu/~cp2124/papers/computer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.columbia.edu/~cp2124/papers/computer.pdf</a>",1269875088
1226641,comment,1226409,1226578,0,0,cia_plant,,,"Any discussion of education seems to bring up a whole raft of ideas about what does and does not effect the young mind, and in which direction.<p>Plato, who was rather more observant and intelligent than you or I, felt that young people would be best served by learning only valorous stories, which showed just and good men triumphing and so on. He felt that the basic components of education ought to be music and gymnastic; and that an overemphasis on music would produce an overly intellectual and sentimental adult (an overemphasis on gymnastic would produce a brute).<p>Views seem to have completely shifted, to the point that Plato's program strikes one as absurd. However, I am not aware of any breakthrough in our understanding of the nature of education: our modern ideas are based, like those of Plato, on an observation of society, and of children, and of education, all colored by our assumptions about what is and is not valuable.<p>When I tell people that I played video games and read novels, they are no doubt inclined to think that I must have become smart and capable thanks to the novels and despite the video games. Why do we think that way, and not in the opposite way - that I became smart by playing video games, and despite reading lots of books? When I solve a hard problem, it feels more like the feeling I have in Quake, when I'm holding the entire playing field in my head and keeping track of where my opponents could be, than like the feeling I have while reading a book.",1269875040

1226633,comment,1226313,1226599,0,0,davidw,,,"Well, to tell the truth, if there's a 'lock', it's pretty obvious you shouldn't be doing it.  If there's just a hash, it strikes me as simply a bad idea in the first place, no matter how long it is.  Someone can just do 'copy image url' and have it work, with no challenge from the application.  A shorter hash is especially bad because it makes them easy to guess at.  I'm not saying it's ""right"" to copy images protected only with a hash, but it's like leaving an expensive bicycle unlocked on a college campus in the US - it's simply not very prudent.  Of course in this case the users probably weren't aware of the problem, and the people who made the application are at fault.<p>Edit: like daleharvey says, the point is really that the hash simply happens to be difficult to find, whereas a proper application will challenge everyone who attempts to access the resource.  For instance, say Alice looks at Bob's picture, and does ""copy image url"", and sends it to Carol.  Carol has no way of knowing whether it's supposed to be private or not, since Alice didn't communicate that information.",1269874837
