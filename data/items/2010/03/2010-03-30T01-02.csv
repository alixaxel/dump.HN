1228112,comment,1227694,1228043,0,0,tsally,,,"<i>You cry about DRM...</i><p>No one is crying here.  It's a serious issue.<p><i>...yet you offer no solution for copyright holders to protect their works.</i><p>First, it's not clear they need protection.  In 2009 movie revenues reached an all time high, despite 2009 being the year of the pirate.<p>Second, copyright holders can protect their works by making the legitimate version more valuable than the pirated one.  DRM is an attempt to get around this basic economic reality. Valve and Apple are examples of companies that understand this.  Other companies should use Steam and iTunes as the gold standard for content distribution.  DRM isn't what makes Steam and iTunes successful, it's that the distribution mechanism is convenient, quick, and social.<p>Third, it is illegal for copyright holders to protect their copyrights by taking away the rights of citizens.  Copyright is not a natural right and enforcement via rights restrictions is not in the purview of private entities.  The <i>government</i> grants and protects copyright <i>if and only if</i> such granting and protection ""promote[s] the Progress of Science and useful Arts"" [Article I, Section 8, Clause 8, the US Constitution]. It's up to the government to decide what rights can be restricted to protect copyright and if such restrictions benefit the people at large.  Personally I think DRM for the purpose of copyright enforcement developed by private entities is unconstitutional.  Congress and Congress alone mandates the protections on copyright.<p><i>Authors wouldn't need to resort to this if mass e-book piracy didn't exist.</i><p>I don't really think this statement needs refutation.  Let me phrase your statement another way: ""law enforcement wouldn't need to resort to wiretapping every phone in America if crime didn't exist"".<p><i>Don't blame Amazon for something the government has been doing for many years.</i><p>Well first of all it was a hypothetical.  But I can and will blame companies for such behavior.  Do you know how much money Cisco made from the Great Firewall?  Companies that enable human rights violations share some responsibility.  I'll blame the construction companies that provided materials to build the concentration camps too.<p>Note that I'm not against other systems of government, just systems of government that systematically violate the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (of which the US is an author and signatory).  I don't think US companies should do business with such governments.",1269914213

It doesn't even have Roles. And it is prone to ""funny"" side-effects, such as the dreaded anonymous user issue which afaik is still unfixed in latest stable.<p>In a nutshell: If you don't remove the two anonymous user grants that mysql puts in there <i>by</i> <i>default</i> then a grant to 'foo'@'%' will allow 'foo' to connect from any host <i>except</i> localhost. Makes sense?  Not?  Thought so.<p>Here's why: The connection attempt from localhost is rejected because the default entry ''@'localhost' matches <i>before</i> your 'foo'@'%' entry.

Then you create the actual users (CREATE USER). Finally you grant privileges to them (GRANT). Optionally you can group them under roles.<p>The common setup that allows local users to connect without a password as any user but demands a password from remote connections takes all of two lines in pg_hba.conf:<p><pre><code>  # TYPE  DATABASE    USER        CIDR-ADDRESS          METHOD
  host    all         all         0.0.0.0/0             md5
  local   all         all                               trust

Then you can make your users:<p><pre><code>  CREATE USER foo WITH PASSWORD 'secret';

And give them access to stuff:<p><pre><code>  GRANT ... TO foo;

They fill in the missing void of the distribution system.<p>In a world without copyright law, publishing houses would learn very quick on how to starve these legal pirates very quick.<p>This is exactly what happens to American publishers selling British books in the 19th century, as there were no copyright treaty with Britain back then. They would flood the market with cheap books, destroying much of the profit potential that could be garnered by legally pirating the books.<p>This is good for Americans, because they can raise their literacy rate with the help of cheap books. The British authors also make money, sometime more than they do in their own country. Their business models consist of auctioning or selling the manuscript to the highest bidder.<p>Even now, Americans publishers can make quite a bit money selling public domain books, often government book like the 9/11 commission report.<p>Even so, I don't really care either way if a copyright-free world  cause less books to appear, or more books to appears. If I want more books, I either download them or buy them. I see no reason to fret over what is ultimately a business model or entrepreneurship problem.",1269911892

Her copy is sufficiently doctored that she thinks it is a novel about farm animals, not a work criticizing the corruption that results from a communist revolution. After she's done Grandma will go to sleep feeling happy, enlightened, and unoppressed by her government, blissfully unaware that she's been duped. Sounds far fetched? If you had asked me in the early 1930s whether a German political party would be able to convince a large portion of the German population that an Aryan race was desirable, I would have said it was far fetched too.""<p>Don't blame Amazon for something the government has been doing for many years.

I don't want to see anyone exploited in the sex-industry, but nor do I believe that making it illegal is a solution.<p>Making it illegal increases the risks, creates opportunities for criminal concerns -- pimps and gangs -- and ultimately does _not_ stop women from entering into prostitution.<p>Prohibition is treating the symptoms, but it doesn't directly and pro-actively deal with the problems currently inherent in much of the sex-industry. The solution in my opinion is legalisation, transparency and regulation.<p>It's magical thinking to think that a simple law can suddenly quash the desire to buy sex and remove the impulse to sell it.<p>Really though, this law doesn't at all seem concerned with the practical issues of safety, instead this is a moral judgement of the trade and the people involved, something I am extremely suspicious of. The act of buying and selling sex is not immoral.

Intellectual Property Landscape of the Human Genome<p>Kyle Jensen and Fiona Murray<p>Summary:
The impact of gene patents on downstream research and innovation are unknown, in part because of a lack of empirical data on the extent and nature of gene patenting. In this Policy Forum, the authors show that 20% of human gene DNA sequences are patented and that some genes are patented as many as 20 times. Unsurprisingly, genes associated with health and disease are more patented than the genome at large. The intellectual property rights for some genes can become highly fragmented between many owners, which suggests that downstream innovators may face considerable costs to gain access to gene-oriented technologies.",1269910902
