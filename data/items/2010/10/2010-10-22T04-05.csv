I implemented a similar solution as more of a stopgap until I had the time to get RabbitMQ installed with a ""proper"" worker dispatcher (more moving parts but less stress on the DB). I mostly ask because we implemented it for our notification system where we had to generate a send large batches of custom emails which was bogging down the page (and hard to debug where in the chain we were getting failed messages).",1287723460
1818649,comment,1815195,1815674,0,0,oogoog,,,"I agree.  But practically, a government must have a way to mollify powerful interest groups or you end up with revolution and chaos.  I think American democracy does a fantastic job of producing a stable and fair environment.  But I'm not convinced it does the best possible job.  As you say, it leads to complex system of laws that are not fair.<p>As a westerner newly living in Asia, I can see Singapore  delivers good, efficient government and they respond to citizens complaints like a good company responds to its clients.  Taxes are low, simple, and are done on a post card.  I think thats the advantage of not being a democracy.<p>However, its not clear to me how they manage their powerful interest groups.  I suppose brute force plays a role.  But honestly, I doubt there is any more brute force used in Singapore than in the US.  And I would trust Singapore to be more fair and even handed.<p>My guess is that China models itself after Singapore.  I think thats where China is trying go.  If they can get there -- and its not clear to me that they can -- in my opinion, it will be a more successful form of government than the democracies of the West.  But they have a long way to.  Singapore is a small island in a unique political and economic situation and I think that makes a huge difference.",1287723440

You have to black-body radiate away the heat of the star driving the system, or the only alternative is that it is all collecting within the system, cooking everybody within in a fairly short period of time.<p>I argue on the basis of real science that we know, not because we know it all but because we can't argue on the basis of science we don't know about. Given that, we damn well <i>can</i> make some guesses about what a space ship will look like, which inevitably includes some form of propulsion involving either the expulsion of very, <i>very</i> hot matter (to get optimum mass efficiency, propellant will be at a premium and no point dumping it out the back cold) or light directly (unlikely but at least plausible) in a directional manner.<p>The topic came up a few months ago during the discussions on whether it is rational for an alien civilization to summarily execute any other civilizations it discovers with relativistic planet-killers, but unfortunately trying to Google up a specific discussion about spaceships and relativistic projectiles is an exercise in futility. Still, work the math on what it takes to get a decent payload (at least several thousand tons would be nice) up to ~.1c, and then recognize that thanks to Newton's laws, the resulting mass-energy number you find must actually be coming out the back of your spacecraft in as close to a single direction as possible. Possibly literally as a laser, though as I said I'm pretty skeptical about the utility of a pure light-drive. It's pretty damned bright.<p>Look, I hate to be offensive, but if you don't fail basic thermodynamics and you actually take seriously the real science we already know, we don't have to retreat into romantic cliches about how we can't possibly understand advanced cultures. We can in fact put bounds on things if our understandings are basically correct, and if our understandings are <i>basically incorrect</i> then frankly we have bigger problems than the question of alien life.<p>The upshot of this, going back to your first post, is that if either of us is retreating into ""religious dogma"", romantic conceptions of reality held onto despite rational examinations of the evidence and science, taking shelter in the possibility of who-knows-what magic science may produce in the future and refusing to use what we already know, it's you, not me.",1287723141

Now, there are two parts to that last sentence.  We may argue over the moral value of piracy, but that's not the point.  The idea that, by criminalizing sharing, they will somehow prevent it, is ludicrous.  If they had taken the tens of millions of dollars they've spent on lawyers and instead put it towards market research, if they had hired people to build them a workable economic model, then we wouldn't be having this conversation.<p>I can moan and complain all I want about the fact that people are copying my work without giving me money, but at the end of the day I'd be much more productive were I to spend that time and energy finding a way to entice them to pay for it.<p>The reason this hasn't happened is simple: The big money in recording is the production houses, and they're fast becoming irrelevant.  They know as well as any of us do that a digital age economic model that sees content creators fairly compensated for their works will necessarily cut them out of the loop.  So, instead of addressing the problem, they lobby and sue and try to cling to some semblance of relevance.

That was my strategy. I had no career and a degree in Philosophy that was taking me nowhere. Out of the blue I jumped into Web development and started building websites for anybody that needed them, for free. Once I had a portfolio of 10 or so I got a few part time position doing web development at a university. This gave me more experience and at the same time I started hacking on more technical aspects like OO PHP, Mysql, Ruby on Rails etc. I hacked on a few things and had some examples to show. This led to one fulltime job doing mostly PHP. I then hacked a bit more with Ruby and landed another job doing that fulltime. Now I am hacking on IOS and Macruby hoping to make a jump into the fields.<p>See the pattern? Get a development job doing whatever you can. Hack on stuff, build it, then try to move up.<p>Key is, Web Based software, IMO, is a show and tell type profession.
