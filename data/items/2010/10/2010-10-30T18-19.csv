I like the HN community but this is a pretty stark difference with the ""advice"" he's being given here. Interesting.<p>So in the spirit of a slightly nicer community, if you were in San Diego I'd be happy to get some beers with you and talk to you about this. I'm 32 now but I was a 21 year old introvert who had just dropped out of school and had low self-esteem once and now would consider myself successful in making a living programming. The thing that got me going was just getting to work. Start making something. Making progress on a project is important and will certainly help your self-esteem. I always learn by picking a project and figuring out the technology/language I need as I go. It helps, believe me. Don't give up, just keep moving. I've never personally been bothered by loneliness but there's got to be clubs and groups around, even if they're like Public Speaking clubs or whatever. You don't have to date or even make best friends in school, just meet people and let things happen.",1288465114

It's not a guaranteed cure-all, but it's highly likely to make you feel better -- it gives you a different perspective, and reminds you that there are people worse off than you (and there seems to be evidence that humans <i>like</i> to feel that they're better off than others).<p>(Some evolutionary psychologists also think there's evidence that ""feeling good from doing good"" is a selected-for trait. That's because the doing-good that results from the feeling-good can confer advantages on kin or on a group.

1851435,comment,1850894,1850894,0,0,evo_9,,,"Some good advice here so far. Some tips on turning this thing around to consider:<p>1. This is 100% mental; beating yourself up mentally internally or otherwise only contributes to the problem - try the opposite. 'Meditate' on positive thoughts (or even a single thought) when this crops up.  Self-doubt is the mind-killer; never forget that.<p>2. Everyone is good at a thing or two - for me it's hockey and music (well other than coding of course) - focus on the positives that those bring into your life when you feel your self-worth going south. Make a habit of reminding yourself of the things that few people can do better than you.<p>3. Start to exercise regularly.  It's amazing how effective regularly releasing endorphins into your bloodstream is. Plus, it helps boost your self-confidence.<p>4. When you go out for lunch, groceries, errands - whatever- make a habit of striking up a conversation with a total stranger or a group of strangers (yes, it is scary actually).  I do this when I'm at lunch alone, often talking with someone, or a group of people sitting near me. No your waiter/waitress or bartender does not count. I find that it forces me out of my 'shell' and I usually learn something interesting as well (people are pretty interesting if you give them a chance it turns out).  BTW, when I chat people up at lunch or in the line at the bank, grocer store, wherever I never consider who they are or their age... aka, I'm not just doing this with women I may be interested in, or just guys around my age... I'll strike up a conversation with an older women, teens, a family, whomever. It's a great way to break out of your natural introversion shell and it's interesting to see what 'normal folk' think (cause let's face it - Hackers are not normal folk at all).<p>5. The more comfortable you are with yourself the more comfortable you will be around others; the opposite is also true.<p>6. Do not seek professional help - you are normal for your age. If anything you might want to look into something like David DeAngelo's books/vids, which I've recommended to several friends who recently divorced (which your situation is oddly similar too I might add - it's a very isolating period for most men); DeAngelo 'preaches' a lot about developing a stronger mental/inner 'game', honing your social skills and above all being confident (and funny) in who you are - if you can master just that - being confident and funny - you will be a whiz in social situation in no time.",1288462583
