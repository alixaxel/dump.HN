So if their only motivation was taxes, they'd have waited.<p>Furthermore, I'm not losing any sleep about the government taxing only the portion of the value of a health plan that exceeds $27,500/yr -- in other words, the first $27,500 remains tax-free -- when the average employer-sponsored health plan is valued at $13,375/yr (2009). And here's what a $20,400/yr plan looks like:<p><i>For the secretaries and environmental engineers, game wardens and van drivers who work for the state of New Hampshire, surgery is free, even at Boston’s top teaching hospitals if it’s necessary. So are MRIs, CT scans, and X-rays.</i><p><i>Pregnant women pay nothing for prenatal care; alcoholics aren’t billed for short stints in rehab. Seeing a therapist costs just $10, as many as 20 visits a year, and prescription drugs top out at $30 for a three-month mail-order supply. New Hampshire state employees get $450 annually toward gym memberships, if they go regularly, or $200 toward their own treadmill - and there’s a $150 annual reimbursement for yoga classes, diabetes clinics, and nutritional counseling.</i><p><a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/07/04/healthcare_overhaul_could_limit_tax_breaks_on_benefits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2009/0...</a><p>Yea, cry me a river if well-paid employees now have to buy their own treadmills or pay for their own rehab.",1286582243

Those are also the features that people cared about and a big part why they were choosing MySQL over psql. At some point early lead turned into crushing defeat in terms of market and mind share.<p>You can claim that some other features constitute ""best free rdbms"" but clearly PostgreSQL team does think that those are included in that definition since eventually they added all of them. The problem is that they did it long after MySQL had them. Too little, too late.<p>The sad part is that it wasn't always a matter of coding but a matter of bad priorities and bad marketing (where I include defining what the product is and isn't as a fundamental part of marketing).<p>For example, I believe psql had high-quality full-text search coded before MySQL did but the core team resisted shipping it by default. Instead for a long time a super valuable feature was part of ""contrib"" package i.e. you had to jump through hoops (like compiling it yourself) to get it to work.<p>The main reason why PostgreSQL failed to MySQL was that the project was driven by extremely bright coders but terrible marketers.",1286581960

Project abandoned because many other sites do this, they are pretty well known or easy to find, the app consumed a lot of bandwidth, and was a popular target for malware.<p># InstantSendMail - Simple one page site that allows you to send an e-mail instantly and quickly. Figured it would be handy when you need to send yourself a note but don't want to take the time to login to your webmail. Abandoned because even with restrictions it would be as handy for spammers as it would for real users, and because of the hassles of running an email server or the responsibility of making sure someone else's wasn't abused.<p># WebCommandPrompt - This was a crazy idea to provide a command prompt interface to the web. It would have eventually an extensive list of command for all sorts of actions you might like to perform on the internet, such as pinging, running trace-routes, querying DNS information, sending quick emails, etc. Similar to how desktop application launchers SlickRun, Find and Run Robot, and Enso work but for the internet. Abandoned because it would be hard to leverage (each command would require its own design and development), and it seemed kind of a step backwards to build a text rather than graphical interface for the internet even if it increased usability.<p># BuriedRiches - An ecommerce site for my own personal use to list stuff I was trying to sell during my eBay days, so that I could market outside of ebay and sell things for longer periods without paying for recurring auctions. Abandoned when I abandoned eBay, because it involved too much work that could not be automated, like taking pictures, shipping, etc.<p># PicVersus - A picture rating site, based mostly around ""cute"" pictures of puppies, kittens, etc where visitors were presented with 2 pictures and asked to choose which was best. Similar to HotOrNot but for cute or funny pictures. Abandoned because it was too easy to create and had too much competition with no competitive advantage.<p># IdentifyRE - A real estate analysis webapp, for RE investors. Input relevant information about properties you are considering, like price, square footage, tax and insurance amounts, market rents, etc and it calculates and displays estimated cashflow of those properties so you can more easily determine which are most likely to be profitable. Abandoned because of the subjective nature of the analysis and the highly specific market for this kind of application made marketing difficult.<p># WealthBarons - An online browser-based game based on real estate, where you can buy virtual property, develop it, and accumulate wealth as you compete with other players to build the largest real estate empire. Never really got off the ground, as other projects took priority and games are very time- and resource-intensive to build.<p># ApocRPG - An online browser-based RPG game. I'm a huge fan of RPGs and I spent a couple of solid years building my own from the ground up, including 2D graphics. Had some very innovative gameplay mechanics such as a choose-your-own-adventure style scenario system, automatic character alignment adjustment (good/evil) based on player actions, etc. Lasted a long time and I was very proud of it, but eventually abandoned as I moved onto other projects.<p># ForumGlance - A tool for people who read web forums a lot, where you can specify the URL of the forums you want to monitor, and it would extract links to the most recent threads and show you on a single page the most recent posts of all your favorite forums. Abandoned because it was too dependent on a wide variety of constantly changing forum software, causing frequent bugs and requiring constant updates.",1286579675

Access to a commercial kitchen is a significant barrier to entry for a food business. Commercial kitchens are big, complicated, and expensive to run—monthly overhead for Logan Square Kitchen, with utilities, pest control, waste pickup, janitorial services, insurance, etc, is about $10,000. Shared-use kitchens allow small-food artisans and other entrepreneurs to ramp up legally with a minimum of risk. Also known as contract kitchens, they're fully equipped and licensed spaces available for rent on an hourly basis to caterers, bakers, confectioners, and others who either can't afford their own kitchen or simply don't need a full-time workspace.""",1286579014

Gmail is pretty much the only Google service I can think of that would be a pain, and they'd keep Gmail even if it were losing money for a large host of reasons.<p>Oh, also Google Voice.
