1819207,comment,1818954,1819119,0,0,instcode,,,"I hate to say this and I know I will be downvoted by ""hackers"" but I really don't understand why people (who know limited or nothing about Java & blindly follow the norm) always pick the word ""ugly"", ""stupid"" for Java? What superior of PHP to Java when with Java I can program from a stand-alone app to webapp, from client side to server side, from desktop to mobile app?... If you are a coder, you must pick a language & a standard lib to be master, and I would say that picking a language that only sticks to a very specific application platform (web-only, desktop-only...) is a very bad choice. I started from C/C++ and moved to Java and I feel very comfortable to use/study Python, C#, Scala & Ruby.. but PHP, get off, never & never ever!<p>One last thing (to convince more PHP people to downvote me) is, if you are spending most of your time on PHP or a web-only-language, you will never see the beauty of asynchronous I/O, socket programming, threading, hooking...<p>Update: When I mentioned ""web-only-language"", I was thinking of people who use & only use Ruby with RoR for web apps. I don't know how many developers who can't distinguish between Ruby & RoR but I guess it's not a small number. And of course, what I said is toward to those who aren't willing to learn new things. They always think about web & only web.",1287745103

I don't want to get into any language wars but certainly in some cases the one single developer coding in a language they are extremely proficient in may in fact help use the ""runway"" most effectively.<p>The cost of collaboration is not equal to 0, and if it was my money I'd be looking for optimal efficiency over broad accessibility.<p>My vote would be for option 1, as you have already indicated that this affects only 40% of your product.  If you do experience continued steady growth and become cash positive then pull in extra resources to support the 40%.<p>Given of course, whatever the 40% is written in is considered to be a <i>good</i> language.

Maybe some folks can suggest some websites for looking up each criteria?<p>I use <a href=""http://www.bestplaces.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bestplaces.net/</a> for comparing US cities.<p>I currently live in a hot place. I would like to go someplace more temperate and my sons would like to go someplace generally cooler than here.  The difference between these two views is that we all agree summers are too hot but, unlike my sons, I don't really want to freeze my arse off in the winter.  The reality is that most places which are cooler in the summer will also be colder in the winter.  The San Francisco Bay Area has the only Mediterranean climate in the US, which is not so hot in the summer but is also not too cold in the winter.  Hawaii is also pleasant year-round in terms of temperature, which is probably why it is hellaciously expensive to live  there.  (I have other reasons I don't want to live in Hawaii -- and, yes, did look into it/ask around -- but even if I wanted to, I couldn't afford it).<p>Anyway, I personally think you would get better feedback if you asked for links to websites with info on each one (individually) of your criteria -- and I would love to add such links to my stash of place-comparison resources.<p>(I occasionally toy with the idea of doing something like bestplaces.net but with a different set of criteria.

Basically, I've started my own software business this year after working for others for the last 10 years and things are going well.<p>Not crazy I'm making barrel loads of cash well, but I have a couple of good clients, a pretty solid little opensource library that is the basis for some good professional services work and if I can finally finish off the last few chapters will have a book published early next year.<p>All in all, I'm really happy with how the first 9-10 months of business have worked out (even if there is a little less money in the bank than I would have liked).<p>The problem is now, I'm really not sure how to move things forward next.  There are a few speaking opportunities that have presented themselves and others I would like to pursue, but obviously this takes out ever-precious time and in general yields little or no financial return.

Should I be looking to pursue speaking opportunities to promote myself, my business and our opensource libraries?  Or is the cost too great?

The App Store has made it significantly easier to sell software made by small developers to iOS users, they are about to make it really easy to sell to Mac users too. It's a business opportunity. The worst you can say about it is that commercial software is catching up with ease of distribution of free software.<p>Hey, you've got 90 days to ship a competing app store for the Mac. Valve has already done so with Steam on Windows and Macs, it isn't insurmountable. What's going to make your one better than theirs?",1287741748

Sure, their CTR is probably lower than most sites, but their traffic is huge.<p>Let's say their CTR is 0.1%.  That's 300k clicks/month.  I'm building in some wiggle-room here, as a 0.1% CTR is abysmal, but often their ads aren't really ads.  Even at $0.01/click, that's still $30k/month. More than enough for hosting. Now, I'd hazard a guess that most of my numbers are quite a bit on the low side, as reddit has operated for years without CN shutting the doors.  Also, from what the admins have intimated from time to time, they make money, but not enough to register on CN's radar.<p>I wouldn't discount their ad sales; traffic like that carries a lot of weight.",1287741613
