1819027,comment,1818500,1818500,0,0,roel_v,,,"A central concept in the article is k-anonymity, which I only learned about maybe a year or two ago. Researching, it appears though that it has been introduced in a conference article in 1998 and has been published in 2002 (<a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.163.9182&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.163...</a>), which I found rather surprising. It's a shame that the knowledge of this concept seems to be mostly restricted to CS circles. Maybe the rather steep technical barrier (research seems to be published mostly in technical context - non-scientific metric: half of the url in the resuls of googling for 'k-anonymity' has 'cs' and 'edu' in the domain name; and no literature on anonymizing datasets for people with only basic schooling in statistics and database theory seems to be available) is preventing the uptake of better database privacy protection.<p>Of course there's also the issue that incentives in collecting and storing sufficiently anonymous data are not aligned (and sometimes in direct competition) with the goals for which the data is collected. This company seems to be making great strides in this field with this research, I hope they keep pushing the edge and publishing their results.",1287737773

Look at the likes of Bingo Card Creator and Balsamiq. Why would Bingo Card Creator belong on TechCrunch? Rather than focusing on one site, you need to work on a long term plan to raise profile within your target market. The last thing you want is a load of uninterested visitors looking for the thing between now and the next big thing. If you business is relevant to it and it's ready, the likes of TechCrunch will come to you. In the meantime focus on the niches within your target market.<p>For example, my company sells two things - Penetration Testing and Incident Response. We're very, very good at it, but not many people know about us in our target markets because we (some might say) foolishly were a little bashful about promoting ourselves. Some of that was a product of size and structure, but most of it was that we were taking the wrong approach. We've picked a niche (GCSX CoCo Health Checks - I know, interesting stuff right?) and have started marketing it offline and online. Have a look at <a href=""http://www.mandalorian.com/services/penetration-testing/gcsx-coco-it-health-check/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mandalorian.com/services/penetration-testing/gcsx...</a> - That's one A/B tested page for one niche (GCSX CoCo Testing) within a niche (Penetration Testing) within a niche (Information Security). We're a B2B consultancy so we tend not to do things like blogging (at least so far) as it has the potential to be a time sink. Instead we focus on winning business in a target sector or niche, which is what you should be doing.<p>Our campaign has an initial ramp period, sustained promotion for a reasonable period and then will enter a business as usual setup.

It's good for Canada to have taken this atypical turn. Calgary's reputation as a redneck enclave is a silly fantasy; it's really a complacent suburban enclave. What it does have going for it, on a good day, is a certain can-do energy. A lot of people here -- including me, and I never imagined I would say such a thing -- would actively support Nenshi in making some sane changes in this place. It would be particularly nice to break out of the stale liberal-conservative rut that this country has been mired in for so long.
