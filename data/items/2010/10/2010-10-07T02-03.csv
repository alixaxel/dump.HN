It wasn't so much achieved by the change in the steady flow of data, but in data transfer spikes. Occasionally there is a disk load spike. When your disks are running 80% capacity, that spike takes them over 100% and causes a dropout in the audio. With the SSDs the disks run at about 4% normally, and the occasional spike just bumps it to the 10 - 20% mark, and it keeps on chugging!<p>I am a total convert to SSDs as a result.

Whether or not it catches typos is up to your logic. All of my method_missing calls eventually hand off to the parent class's implementation when they can't match anything.<p>> The proper way to deal with duplication, as described in this article, is of course to use functors.<p>Except this is ruby. Ruby has modules to deal with duplication between classes and code blocks (closures, which can be bound to variables) for general use. It also allows for a rather clean implementation of the proxy design pattern via method_missing. Anything dealing with classes assumes OOP, not FP.<p>I only have begun to figure out that I don't know anything about FP but your comment seems rather absurd in this context.",1286419672

1766662,comment,1766381,1766381,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"I prefer to use define_method over method_missing when ""metaprogramming"". It allows you to explicitly define your ""metamethods"" up-front.<p>Using his example of the DoNotDisturb wrapper around InformationDesk, you could easily do something like:<p><pre><code>  [:emergency, :flights, :local_transports, :hotels].each do |name|
    define_method(name) do
      check_lunch_break unless name == :emergency
      @desk.send(name)
    end
  end
</code></pre>
Now you don't get the side effect of screwing up your exception handling and having to walk on eggshells with the rest of your coding in that class.<p>The other thing I like about this method is that it gets evaluated once, and then those methods exist. With method_missing, every single time you call one of those methods, it has to go all the way up the chain to find that method until it finally hits method_missing.<p>EDIT: Oh, and if nothing else, you can at least put the define_method inside the method_missing (I had a project that required method_missing once, so this is what I did). That way, it only has to crawl all the way up the inheritance chain once, then that method gets defined on your class, so subsequent calls to that method don't have to go all the way up the chain again.<p>Might not be much performance gain in Ruby, but when programming a rails app (where you're likely working on a class that inherits from ActiveRecord and 10 other classes), it helps.",1286419308

If you charge $90/hr, your income is $90,000.<p>But this is definitely not equivalent to a $90k salaried job.  You are taxed at a higher rate.  If you set aside 40% for taxes and 10% for a rainy day, only 50% of your income is spendable.  So $90/hr gives you $45,000/yr of spendable money (and you still have to pay for your benefits like health insurance).<p>So don't be shy about charging more, but do make sure that your customer is getting what they pay for (quality code in a timely fashion with good customer service).",1286418156
