Which is where I bought my iPhone. (and it should come as no surprise that Singapore sells them locked.) I would venture to say that [Hong Kong] is poster child of libertarianism</i><p>To clear up a common misconception I see (and I have no understanding of where this misunderstanding comes from), 'net neutrality' and everything of that ilk (including regulated phone unlocking) is NOT libertarian.

It is a great place to start a company.<p>A lot of this article is outdated, but it is infamous. Singapore is still an autocratic regime, but steadily becoming more progressive. For instance, local bloggers used to be tailed/monitored and harassed, while today they are invited to official government events and given blogger passes (like a press pass) to cover events on behalf of the citizenry.<p>The city/country is very surreal, especially once you begin to dig under the surface.<p>I have a blog post about it that has been sitting in my drafts for over a year now with a bunch of observations (I met a lot of entrepreneurs, businesses, the government people etc.). I have a lot of interesting stories about Singapore. Reading about Singapore again today has prompted me to dig it up - I will publish it this weekend.<p>I love that place so much that I would seriously consider opening an office there, or at least hiring some people there, for my next startup. It is definitely the most 'Silicon Valley' like city in this hemisphere.<p>If anybody on HN needs some tips or intros re: Singapore, feel free to email me.",1288331853

1846322,comment,1845915,1845915,0,0,geuis,,,"Absolutely NOT. Take as many AP classes as you can. They are generally college level. You will find it much easier to get into the schools you really want if you actually graduate. Despite what people may say, GED's don't carry the same social weight as diplomas. A high school diploma is itself nothing more than to say that you passed the base level of societal education, but many people consider a GED to mean that you we're not even capable of achieving that low-level rung.<p>Do what you can to graduate early. THAT looks good. If you can finish in 2 or 2.5 years what takes most of us 4 years, and you can do it with a very high GPA, that's just all gold stars right there.<p>The other thing to keep in mind about graduating with a diploma is that of grants and scholarships. College is going to be <i>fucking expensive</i>. I'm assuming you're 15-17 years old. So you might not understand what fucking expensive really means in your bones, beyond ""that's a lot of money"". Don't take this as an insult or anything. I'm 30 years old and it took until I was like 27 to really, really understand how much ""fucking expensive"" really is. For me it was moving from South Florida where I was making at most $30k to SF where I've been making 2.5-3x that much as a salary.<p>Anyway, grants and scholarships are free money you don't have to pay back later. And when you're 25 looking to start a career and whatnot, you'll really appreciate not having massive loan payments to pay on a monthly basis.<p>I'm currently in the middle of my 2nd startup, and since you are here on HN I'll put my argument in those terms. Look at high school as your first startup. The only way its going to succeed is based on how much work and sacrifice you're willing to put into it. If you can make it through that, many other things in your life will be much easier.",1288331790

1846306,comment,1846019,1846093,0,0,charlief,,,"Very interesting example.  This is definitely the reality, but perhaps you can teach an old beast new tricks.<p>1. In the hypothetical situation you provided, it seems that if your CPA is based on trial signups, the cost structure doesn't scale with the demand and value you get from using the SEO charging per trial.  If you generate revenue on a conversion, why do you have a CPA based on a trial registration?  Doesn't eBay pay per conversion?  Perhaps this is a common practice.  Can you renegotiate to a more reasonable cost structure, maybe get it right from the start or allow some flexibility if you and the SEO aren't aware of how the costs will play out?<p>2. If eBay is unhappy about the LTV per CPA, why not agree on a cost structure that more readily scales with varying LTV rather than blame the affiliate for not meeting a particular threshold?<p>3.  There is an opportunity cost with firing an affiliate due to poor traffic quality for a month rather than keeping them consistently there.  You might fire your SEO for one month's bad performance in a heavy-handed fashion, but what if Christmas, not just any old Christmas, turns out to be a legendary one.  Bingocardcreator is <i>the</i> new hot fad for Christmas family games night and conversion rates are through the roof.  If there was a cost structure that hedges odd months like October, (3-month moving average of CPA for example) your SEO would be around consistently, ready for a key opportunity.<p>I see parallels here to most successful farmers that use futures to hedge their fuel costs and stabilize their revenue in varying weather and environmental conditions.  It won't save you from an SEO not being economical, but it will make the costs less uncertain.<p>4.  Helping an SEO affiliate optimize on an aspect that may or may not be under their control may be a big task, but already, providing a conversion table like you did is probably more than what was probably provided by eBay.<p>5.  <i>It is not economical to work with people to optimize their sites to hopefully be sending quality traffic again, since that is hard, non-obvious</i>  Sites don't have to do a lot, just be transparent and manage expectations above the bare minimum.  Affiliates like everyone else don't like uncertainty mixed into their return on investment.  Even if the nature is an uncertain one, you can still manage expectations to keep that fact transparent, and keep a cost structure flexible but clear enough to support.<p>6.  <i>might be against the interests or intentions of the site owner, and consumes resources which would be better spent optimizing the customer's own sites.</i>  Brilliant insight, this is probably a factor as well, but I care to believe that eBay still handled this case in a sloppy fashion.",1288331336

Okay, not as cool as Manhattan or Tokyo or Hong Kong or London, but still pretty normal.<p>As for the death penalty, yeah, they have it.  Singapore talks tough but it does not feel like a police state there.  When I come home to the US, I am asked 20 questions by the immigration agents.  I live here, just let me in.  In Singapore, they have ""death to drug traffickers"" written everywhere, but the immigration agents did not ask me a single question.  I don't even recall the usual customs line (red lane / green lane).  If you change planes in Singapore, you don't even go through security.  You are released into the secure area and you just walk to the gate where your other flight leaves.  If you want to traffic drugs, they may have the death penalty, but they don't <i>really</i> care.  (They say they care, and they make an example out of one in a million people, but they don't <i>really</i> care.

1846226,comment,1842582,1842582,0,0,Ixiaus,,,"I'm building a startup with Python and Pylons - Pylons comes with paster (python web server) and a small unit testing hook for your app; pylons makes it so <i>easy</i> to test your application, I love it. You can write two types of tests: functional tests and unit tests.<p>I split functional tests into the tests that actually make a web request (by spawning paster, loading the application, and pretending to be a user) - my lowest ""unit"" there are my controllers. I have to have some special trickery to handle sessions, but it isn't bad, beats having no tests.<p>My ""unit"" tests are a bit less fine-grained than yours are. I've had difficulty narrowing tests down below the module level with anything but libraries; primarily because models (the culprits here) have a few interdependencies. I do my best to keep my models orthogonal but not all of them are, so most of my unit tests are basically testing models as they operate on the database tables and some of their assistant methods.<p>If I write a library, I generally try to determine whether it can be its own ""module"" or should be a module within the application namespace. For example, I wrote an authorize.net payment library and ultimately decided that it should have its own tests - separate from the application, which lead me to splitting it off as its own project (PayPy now, with adapter support for some other gateways). Writing some of the library modules in their own namespace with their own tests keeps it clean orthogonal.<p>Overall, I would say this: I'm not as OCD about writing tests as you are because I'm the sole developer and there are too many features to build to be writing functional tests every time I build a controller. My philosophy is this, though: the models should <i>all</i> be covered, no matter what; since they are the messiest bit of logic (usually) in a web application - translation between <i>relational</i> data into <i>object oriented</i> data has a lot of side effects. Having all models covered ensures that the majority of my logic that interacts with the database is solid. It also keeps any schema/model changes in check that may affect other models I've forgotten about.<p>After that, I try to make sure any <i>critical</i> controllers/pages/functional pieces are covered - the really trivial stuff I worry less about and just make sure it ""works right"" by doing some manual testing myself before pushing it.<p>I love functional/unit testing - I will never go back.
