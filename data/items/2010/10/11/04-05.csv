However, Peter Seibel's ""Practical Common Lisp"" is quite close in terms of target audience, and also very good.<p>I won't argue with the assertion that Common Lisp is hard to learn.

C is easy to learn because it is small, but it is also C.  (I'm programming C and Ruby in my day job, and I love C, but there are times when I wish it had more of the expressive and abstractive power of Ruby or Common Lisp.)  Common Lisp is hard to learn, but once you've learned it you get to program in Common Lisp.<p>Regarding LOOP:  some people consider integral calculus difficult to learn.

To live a fairly ""average"" standard of living compared to any North American or European city, São Paulo costs way more.<p>But I guess what I'm trying to say is that São Paulo has a very high degree of variability. It <i>can</i> be cheaper, if you are willing to let go of certain things.<p>For instance:<p>- why living ""by the rivers"", you can live on the East Side or closer to the South? Saúde, Ipiranga... good neighborhoods but much cheaper. Downtown (Centrão) São Paulo also still has a lot of stigma, so prices are lower than the West side.<p>- The R$250 phone plan is a luxury, if you enjoy it and can afford, more power to you. But it isn't a necessity.<p>- I wouldn't go out at any place where a beer costs 6 bucks. I wouldn't go to a place where they have a minimum charge of R$40, like many do in the neighborhoods you mentioned.<p>- Why buy a Mac, if you can go to Santa Ifigênia and get a more-than-decent box for R$800?",1286771783

What's that, your first indicator is the <i>electronic temperature sensor on your dashboard</i>!? My, there certainly is no way a computer could detect that.<p>If you are about to say, you detect it through loss of power, steam from the engine bay, coolant in the oil... I got news for you, you just detected it slower than a computer would have. A properly designed automatic driving system would monitor the vitals of the engine, and pull over in the event something goes critical, much the same way your PC shuts off when the CPU hits some predetermined temperature. Even better, if all cars were automatically driven, it would communicate this abnormality with the other cars on the road. It would be able to determine that this is unusual (it's not just a hot day), and it would also be able to co-operate with the other cars on the road to pull over safely as fast as possible.<p>The things you list are not ""this is why automatic driving is impossible"". They are just ""here's special cases we have to make sure to catch"". In the case engineers miss a case, good feedback control systems can often cope for the unexpected event, and in the event they can't, there's always manual control. Hell, let's be honest here- most drivers would not detect a blown head gasket until the car simply stopped functioning, and the engine was completely destroyed anyway. There's tons of case where humans perform terribly, including some on your list. Accidents are caused all the time by people braking for squirrels when they shouldn't.",1286769876
