While it told all the steps needed to build a system, it didn't really explain <i>why</i>. Download this specific version of a package, download this magic patch, and type in ./configure, make, make install. What it failed to tell is where to find those patches, how to find compatible versions of software, what alternatives do some software have etc etc.<p>Based on that experience I wouldn't recommend LFS. Either spend your time studying some prebuilt system (I remember one time installing Debian via chroot, which came out extremely minimal, and that was somewhat interesting), or actually design and build your <i>own</i> Linux-based system. Outline (maybe on paper) what parts you want (maybe you have heard of some trendy init replacement, or you just hate pulseaudio and love oss, etc). Then research what you need to run that stuff.

Agnosticism is important to Mongrel2. If you open your mind to the concept, you can begin to see how using SQLite for configuration becomes a bike shed in the entire scope of the project.<p>If I'm a shop looking for a single web server to host apps written in a variety of languages, chances are that I'm going to have an opinion about the process used to configure and administer that server. That opinion is going to include the structure, process, and implementation of the entire server and management tool stack. The same thing happens with servers that use plaintext configuration formats as well. Have a look at the differences in Apache administration on Redhat based distributions versus Debian based distributions. Look at the number of tools that exist for managing Apache conf files. True, not everyone uses them, but the manageability of editing these text files by hand only scales so far. At some point, you turn to a tool that abstracts away the underlying (canonical?) configuration file. At that point, the underlying format -- text or SQLite -- becomes less important. Hence, Zed's repeated referral to this whole issue as a ""bike shed"".<p>What I think is really cool about this entire approach is that there will likely be a wide variety of tools built to manage different types of Mongrel2 hosting environments. The power of SQLite will come to bear when implementing these tools. SQL is a powerful tool for collecting and updating information. There are plenty of text libraries that perform similar tasks, but text is a lowest common denominator. At the end of the day, I think it's a pretty interesting choice.",1286814691

Use a lumbar roll -- you place this in your lower back and it forces you to maintain a lordosis (curve of the spine) by keeping it in position.  This will be tiring for the first couple of weeks, but eventually it will feel natural.<p>Here is a link to a lumbar roll similar to what I've used: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Original-McKenzie-D-Section-700-Lumbar/dp/B000GPM520/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Original-McKenzie-D-Section-700-Lumbar...</a><p>2. Monitor height -- you want your monitor to be positioned so that you are looking straight ahead, rather than down, towards your monitor.  If you are forced to look down there is a better chance of leaning forward instead of maintaing good posture.<p>If you're using a laptop, consider buying a laptop stand to increase the height of the laptop. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/AliMed-Smart-Stand-Laptop/dp/B003T1LWW2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/AliMed-Smart-Stand-Laptop/dp/B003T1LWW...</a><p>If you can't get your monitor high enough relative to your position, you'll need a taller desk.\n-------------------------------------------------------<p>Those are my two biggest tips, but there are others:<p>Chairs are not made equal... different chairs have definite discrepancies in the amount of pain they cause me on a day to day basis.  Even expensive ones will send shooting pains down my leg within a few hours of sitting in them.  If you can test some new chairs out for a day or two at a time, I'd recommend doing so.<p>Get up, walk, and/or stretch regularly for a couple of minutes.  At work I use a small cup for water, which requires me to refill every 45 minutes or so.  A quick 2 minute walk to the water tank for a fill-up is a refreshing break for our backs.",1286814330

In particular, you have to carve them into some pieces that are <i>non-measurable sets</i>, which basically means that the carving is so exotic that it is not possible to define a consistent concept of volume for these pieces. This is sort of the heart of the paradox:  you get volume-preserving transformations to disobey preservation of volume by using intermediate steps with undefined volume.<p>Non-measurable sets are not 100% legit in mathematics. Constructing them relies on the Axiom of Choice. I won't get into the debate about the Axiom of Choice, but suffice it to say that if you reject the Axiom of Choice, then the Banach-Tarski Paradox need not be true, and you can self-consistently reject the BTP if you are OK losing the AOC.<p>The biblical reference from King Solomon is probably referring to the parable of splitting the baby. Two women came to King Solomon, each claiming to be the true mother of the baby. King Solomon suggested cutting it in half, in order to observe the claimants' reactions. The fake mother was ok with this, and the real mother would rather give up her child than see it killed, . XKCD suggests that King Solomon was actually attempting to use the Banach-Tarski paradox to create two babies.",1286814175

The way I previously understood it, the -1 would be a <i>signed</i> integer which has some binary representation, and <i>that</i> binary representation would become the uint.<p>Weird bit of arcana. Below is my mistaken comment. (Notice that I pretended that UINT_MAX is not all 1s, which is silly. I suppose I made that mistake because I ""couldn't be wrong"" or something.)<p>As far as I know, your <i>definition</i> can't be inferred from the C standard.  The answer itself acknowledges that -1 doesn't yield 0xFFFF… on every platform.

Right now youmixer is pretty much just for me and my friends who ""get it"". I think the site is pretty close to being something everyone can ""get"", and I'd like to see this experiment through to the end.<p>Let me know if you're interested -- <a href=""http://magarshak.com/contact"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magarshak.com/contact</a>",1286813058

The wind has clear access to three walls of the house and the roof. I've double insulated it and put a central heating in so it's a bit better now, the first year here I went through 250 euros of gas per month in the winter alone and it was <i>still</i> cold.",1286813029

If your pondering is that you don't want to mess up your current system, then install Virtual Box and run whatever else you want to learn from in a virtual machine inside VB.<p>The problem you may encounter, given that you say you've been only using Ubuntu, is that LFS may be taking a dive from the high platform into the deep end of the pool when you are not ready yet for that experience.  You may want to ease into that just a little bit more.<p>My suggestion for you is to go download yourself a copy of the latest Slackware distribution, and start there.  You'll learn 95% of what LFS will teach you just from Slackware alone, without also taking that high dive before you are ready.<p>And, again, if you don't want to kill your current system, then just install Virtual Box and then install as many distro's as you please (including LFS) as VM's.  You get the same experience, without breaking your current working system.",1286812883

If I let it affect my mood I'd be pretty F-ing depressing to be around.
