1778942,comment,1777385,1778597,0,0,budman,,,"Such a great post.<p>I have played live medium stakes poker in Vegas for 14 years now. Have witnessed the boom firsthand. Before the poker tv ""boom"" it used to be sort of embarrassing when family and friends from back home would ask about poker and what not because it always had a negative mystique about it. During the boom everyone was all of a sudden interested and wanted to listen about how exciting it must be. But the boom completely skewed reality and perspectives unlike anything I have ever seen, even compared to the housing boom.<p>I can't count how many times in past 7 years I'd be at table full of early 20 somethings claiming they are or am thinking about going ""pro"" (quiting job/college for poker FT). For every Tom Dwan type of story there are probably 1000x the stories similar or WORSE to the Washington Post article. It was never my business so I never made it my biz, but I used to be sad seeing so many talented/bright and charismatic kids be so lost and throwing away years chasing the rush and shot at being famous. Gambling, in any form, takes a very special tough minded character to do in long run since, like matt says, the losing streaks will come. I have told my wife one thing I wish I could erase from my mind would be poker. And I am a long-term winner! It just wears you down and matt mentioning how most can't fathom the emotional swings is true. It becomes worse the more early success one has because the resulting crash will be harder.<p>The smoke and mirrors of poker created by TV is FAR from real. Away from the lights and camera while they hype most of these guys up is mostly a collection of low lives grinding 60hrs a week on their asses just to pay the bills. Many of the big names the world has come to know have also gone broke at times. Not always because of poker but it just harbors other bad habits.<p>Anyway, enough of that. I do want to say Matt that during it time I was an avid follower of your blog. I could always tell you were one of the more grounded and mature young players that was having success and always knew you wouldn't let your head get too big. Sorry it took a tragedy of that magnitude to get you out but in the end it was probably best.",1286776597

Keep in mind, that just even for renting, you will have to give a first, deposit, (and sometimes last month).

When it is at least 60% done, and you have a bit more savings, go full swing into it.<p>The rule of thumb, you should have at least 1.5 years of savings.

That's pretty much it. Once there is demand the technology will catch up pretty quickly.<p>For example, when after WWII middle class americans ended up with money (either from their pay as soldiers, or due to the higher salaries during the war time labor shortages), the US economy and technology grew very quickly to acomodate every single desire they might have, cars, houses, highways, boats, every consumer product you may think of, etc. were built in enormous quantities.<p>But now the middle class is relatively poor and at their best hope is to stay at the same level. So their spending decreases or stays the same. And the economy suffers.<p>Why aren't there household robots? Because people are too poor. The middle class american is too poor to afford a complex piece of robotics, and also there is a bunch of even poorer people that will do your housework for cheap. So why would anybody invest in a complex expensive Jetson's like household robot?<p>Take Hacker News for example, full of innovative people but most of them are working hard trying to figure out how to make money from a free product.

I came up with (and executed) that idea four years ago, but it worked using a series of perl scripts piped together, no way I could deploy that to high school chem labs.  By the time I learned how to program android, there were other, more capitalizable ideas...<p>The way it worked was to instead to use a 96-well plate (indexed,  by blotting out certain wells) that would allow the software to key the matrix of wells and determine 'circles' to sample optical density based on the rgb values of the resulting jpg image - averaging across the entire circle.  The experimenter would set up a 'calibration curve' in certain pre-indiced wells.<p>Typically you would have to have a color filter - i.e. if the color being evolved was yellow then you would take the photograph in blue light.",1286774392

ClassConnect is 100% free. Forever.""  I don't think you should really save that for last.. seems like something you'd want to have stand out on the home page.<p>- I got about 2 min into the intro video and it froze up, so maybe check bandwidth issues.  The video seemed to be too long, and the first 2 minutes I weren't that interesting.  I think starting off by showing your main workflow would be better - how simple it is to upload a document or save a video and share it with your class.<p>- ""Why license"" and ""License Features"" look basically the same, and I'm still not totally sure what it is.  Why would I want support?<p>Hope some of that is helpful.  Good luck!",1286774271

I'm sure additional stimulus dollars would be money far better spent than the money we have spent burning Iraq and Afghanistan to the ground, but the fact remains that additional stimulus spending must be additionally paid back some day. The chief question in my mind is whether the return on those additional dollars would be worth the price.<p>I think you may be overestimating the extent to which outright Republican lies, numerous though they are, are affecting consensus on this issue among economists. For example, there are many non-Keynesians out there who disagree with the assertion that high government spending can counteract a recession.<p>I must confess, though, I don't have my ear to the ground as well as I would like on this topic. Kind of makes you wish that there was a Cliff's notes for recent updates in the outlook of experts and academics on various important topics. My understanding is that Krugman's outlook typically differs somewhat from most economists' beliefs (as surely it would with Mankiw's arguments in the linked article), but perhaps that is not the case re: additional stimulus spending?",1286774135

However you could definitely pull it off with 6 months money although 12 months would be better :)  A few months after going on my own I also landed a contract dev job that helped me make it an additional 6 - 8 months and attend some events I wanted to.  I did the dev work at night and then just worked on my project during the day.<p>If you are all-in on your new project though, you should be able to make it though.  Just make sure you already have that new computer or whatever tools you'll need to get started.  I've found a nice computer always boosted my productivity and made me feel better :)",1286774135

Yearly checks might have been too granular, and the marker could have spiked shortly after his last test. Also, I'm guessing that it's rare to even know you have it until you start getting symptoms. How often do doctors run blood tests for random protein markers?<p>From wikipeida, it looks like the cancer is related to abnormal white cell buildup. If he's traveling a lot, he would be exposed to more sicknesses, and so might have more white cells then usual, so he has more to build up. But then again, IANAD, so this might be completely wrong.",1286773466
