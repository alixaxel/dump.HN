Last Wednesday we launched an invite-only IT community at Talentopoly.com. It's a place for programmers, designers, and IT professoinals to share what they're working on, get feedback, and learn from other talented professionals.<p>I think there is a serendipity that can happen when you get a few talented developers and designers in a room; conversation leads to hatching new ideas and new ways to approach the design. This can be hard to recreate in a company with only a handful of developers. I've faced this problem myself when I'm working solo on projects. So we created Talentopoly to be a virtual room full of talent to see if we can catch that lightning in a bottle. I think it will be especially useful for freelancers and people working in companies with one or two other developers/designers.<p>It's invite-only and will probably remain that way. Posts and questions are only visible to the community. Users have profiles and can post their resume. Each user has a certain number of invites they can send out.<p>Examples of posts would be an awesome pic of something a designer is working on and wants some feedback on, a link to a new jQuery plug-in, asking the community what they listen to while they work, and starting a discussion by posting about the best places to host your new web project. Even finding people to work with you on your next great pet project is a really great way to use the site.<p>I'm thinking (hoping) that this site might be a good fit for a lot of HN readers. To request an invite just head over to http://www.talentopoly.com and submit your info. We invite a few new users every day.",1286650292

Once you have all your friends separated into lists you can change your privacy settings and many other options based on those various lists. So for example, my relatives can see certain photo albums that my work colleagues can't see, and I have college friends who can see albums that my relatives and work colleagues can't see.

Also, I find comparing branches (through log, diff, etc...) a bit painful, especially because of inconsistencies between naming in hg - git naming is less user friendly, but much more consistent.<p>IOW, Git complexity comes from a f*cked-up UI, but hg simplicity is only superficial. Any semi-advanced usage in hg requires queues, a lot of plugins, etc... whereas git supports all that out of the box. Some simplicity in hg is also seriously broken - the ""simple"" version naming is a very bad idea in DVCS. Inevitably, different people will refer to the same revision (r1234) which is in fact a different revision because they are relative to different repositories.<p>Merging is also not that great in hg: I really miss git index when I need to resolve conflict. But I have a strong dislike for kdiff3 and that sort of tools.",1286648729
