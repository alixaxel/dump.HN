1789768,comment,1789426,1789505,0,0,macrael,,,"Supporting a wider variety of hardware does not necessarily lead to commanding a larger market share. Who's to say a smaller number of devices that Google (or the device makers) were able to spend more time on supporting and polishing wouldn't sell more units than the broad array of phones we see? It would certainly lower the barrier to creating great apps on the platform, which would encourage wider adoption.<p>It seems silly to me to say blankly that ""Choice is good."" Obviously there are upper limits on how true that can be. If Motorola were designing and shipping and selling thirty different android phones right now, that choice would not be good. The phones would suffer and customers wouldn't know where to begin thinking about which phone they wanted.<p>The hassles for a developer associated with testing and making apps compatible on such a wide variety of devices are not trivial. It's a tradeoff, and Google is making no effort to control how that tradeoff breaks. Microsoft is taking a different approach. We'll see how that plays into things.",1287028686

That can act as a certain type of social ""shunning"" on a node-to-node basis.<p>There are interesting, open theoretical computer science questions that determine how effective such an approach can be, and how susceptible it is to attack. Without a theoretical understanding of how your reputation system works, how do you propose to solve the spam and ""evil"" problem?

Really though, if it ain't broke, don't worry about it.  I was just curious as to why there was this roundabout.<p>Removing the quotes won't fix the problem, because you've also altered the way characters are escaped via the .replace() calls.<p><i>One potential downside of making it just straight JSON is that this is generated by our Python template and if for whatever reason this isn't valid JSON it would throw a javascript exception when the file is loaded.</i><p>I'm not familiar with Python, but there shouldn't be any reason why simplejson would return invalid JSON.  In the event that it does, your script would still break, anyway.

If you have a similar wattage charging option in a car with a 200+ mile range battery, it may turn out that the time that you will spend for lunch/restroom breaks in a typical 500 mile day of driving will be enough to recharge your battery enough, assuming you start the day with the battery topped off, and all of the restaurants and rest stops have charging stations.  (But I suspect the restaurants will see early adoption of charging stations as a way to attract customers/advertise their business.)<p>The trucking industry may well benefit from swap stations, though.  The Tesla Roadster is something like 1/4 or 1/3 battery by weight.  The entire tractor of a typical tractor trailer rig is probably a bit less than 1/4 of the total rig by weight, and the tractor can't be 100% battery.  This will probably translate to a somewhat shorter range.<p>On the other hand, at 60 MPH, wind resistance is probably what consumes most of the energy, and that is not strictly proportional to the weight as you scale up from personal automobile to tractor trailer.",1287025639
