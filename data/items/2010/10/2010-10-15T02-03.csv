His business was in processing scrap components (everything from buttons for factory machines to the aforementioned oil pipes) and reselling them.  This involved a lot of manual labor sorting e.g. a pile of 10,000 switches into functioning and broken ones, then sorting by color, or in cleaning oil pipes using a toothbrush and some solvent (motor oil, as I recall).<p>I learned an important lesson from that job: when someone tells you he doesn't want to have you on the books because of ""OSHA and the IRS and all that rot"", that is a leading indicator you can use for ""not someone you want to work for"" prior to getting a 20 lb oil pipe thrown at your head close enough to move your hair.",1287111596

1793529,comment,1792353,1793203,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> I once had a case come to me after some homeowners had lost at trial in a dispute with their mortgage lender over some technical provisions of their mortgage. The amount at stake was perhaps a couple of hundred thousand dollars. However, on losing, the court awarded the lender almost $400K in fees (it did so under a contract provision providing that the prevailing party in any dispute would receive an award of such fees).<p>The problem here wasn't the fact that the loser wound up paying the court fees.<p>The real problems started with hearing the case on a planet where FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS in legal fees was considered reasonable for any court case, and where apparently a contract provision stating this was considered enforceable rather than struck down as manifestly unreasonable.<p>This was compounded by hearing the case in a region on that planet where the appeals system comes with a price tag of several years' salary.<p>Costs are supposed to be just that: the cost of bringing a case to court. That means things like paying to build courthouses and paying a salary to those who run the courts (from the judges to the janitors) and, yes, even paying a reasonable rate to the lawyers. If your courts are ever awarding more than that in costs, no matter what the outcome of the case, then your legal system is broken.",1287111450

1793527,comment,1793475,1793475,0,0,justrudd,,,"I'll veer away from the legal status aspects of it :)  But as far as rejecting an accepted offer, an offer letter isn't binding.  It is signals your intent to sign a contract (i.e. that long employee agreement that no one reads).  And even when you sign the agreement depending on which state you reside in, you are probably in a ""right to work"" state which means you can quit without cause, and they can fire without cause.  So rejecting an accepted offer isn't that big of moral deal to me.<p>The main thing is what is making your change your mind.  Another thing to consider is the size of the market where you are.  If you are in a small market (say Spokane, WA) then word might get around that you are ""wishy-washy"".  In a larger market, maybe not.<p>I've been on both sides of this before.  From the employee side, I'd reject an accepted offer if something came up that gave me pause.  I've rejected an accepted offer when I realized I didn't really want to move to Boston.  Things change.  They understand that.<p>From the employer side, I'd rather someone reject an accepted offer vs. coming to work and not really wanting to be there.  It costs quite a bit of money to on board an employee - benefits, computer, parking passes, etc.  While some of that might be in the works because you accepted, I doubt much of it is.  I'd rather eat the cost on the few things I did vs. bringing you on and having you quit a few months later or having to fire you later for not working out.",1287111332

1793504,comment,1793087,1793087,0,0,CoryOndrejka,,,"From details on ZestCash's website, there are four fairly substantial ways in which they are different than payday loans, which the original author seemed to dismiss.<p>First, ZestCash is charging a substantially lower APR than payday loan shops (280% versus 480%).<p>Second, ZestCash allows partial repayment. This is critical, as requiring full repayment is a major factor in forcing payday loan customers to rollover their loans, incurring additional fees and leading to additional loans. Partial repayment is far more likely to result in a customer who can actually pay off their loan and is not trapped in a cycle of debt.<p>Third, ZestCash further increases the chances of repayment by allowing flexibility in both amount and length of the loan.<p>Fourth, as the Center for Responsible lending points out, most payday loan employees are minimum wage and not trained to help customers in any way. Anyone approved at ZestCash gets a personal representative who will work with the customer 1-on-1 for the life of the loan.<p>Time will tell whether the ZestCash team is able to generate positive change for the underbanked -- full disclosure, I've worked with Douglas and think he's very sharp -- but I certainly think their story is a lot more balanced than the original article would suggest.",1287110967
1793502,comment,1792353,1793098,0,0,Silhouette,,,"Everything about a court case is a conditional. It is relatively unusual for the evidence to be so clear-cut that there is no doubt about the verdict, and often a court must make the fairest decision it can based on far less evidence than it might like.<p>That said, this isn't really a hypothetical issue. Our courts function in this way every day. Please understand that to those of us on this side of the Atlantic, everything you are describing just sounds weird. ""Judiciary corrupted by electioneering""? Judges responding ""non-punitively""? Our judiciary in the UK has a long and honourable tradition of being the standard-bearers of justice that one would hope they would be, and of resisting politicisation far more effectively than the other major branches of government (to the extent that we have them; our system doesn't treat US-style separation of powers as sacrosanct either).<p>Having been in a court on a couple of occasions, although never as a plaintiff or defendant, I have always been impressed by the way the officials conducted themselves. IMHO, our legal system does have its problems when it comes to handling relatively low-value cases, but those are more due to the time and effort required to figure out how the system works and complete all the paperwork than because the legal fees are prohibitive.<p>One injustice I have personally witnessed happened when someone was cleared of a motoring offence, on the second hearing since the first was aborted when courtroom time ran out for that day. That person lost had two days of their life attending court, and presumably also spent considerable time planning their defence (as they were not legally represented). They must also have had the stress and uncertainty from waiting nearly a year to hear the verdict, and presumably lost out on some income that would have been earned on those days they were in court, because even though they were cleared of all charges, defendants do not even seem to get the same expense refunds that witnesses do. I find the fact that someone deemed not guilty in court should still be harmed even to that extent to be unfair. I simply do not understand how any system where someone innocent might wind up paying out hundreds or thousands in a settlement because the danger of having to pay for their own defence in court would be even more could possibly be in the interests of justice.",1287110954

Maybe it resembles a credit union account.  Maybe it is something weird, like cell phone companies moving further into the consumer credit space.  (It might not be obvious, but cell phone contracts are economically equivalent to an extension of credit, and they're made to work profitably among populations that no sane financial institution would touch.)
