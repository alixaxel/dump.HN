I'm glad to see that he's so upbeat about it now, and that he still seems to think it was worth it.  As a serial entrepreneur, I know that I will eventually be in his position, and I hope I will handle it so gracefully.<p>I also caught a great one-liner from Reid (something to the effect of): ""The big danger is not Google or Microsoft building your exact product -- they probably won't.  The big danger is 1000 other startups building slightly similar, and you getting lost in the noise.""  (Except he said it better than I am restating it.)  For me, that took a lot of things that I had understood but never really examined and crystallized them into an 'aha!' moment.<p>I liked Paul's entire talk quite a lot -- his thoughts on funding were typically well-stated and articulate, and it didn't hurt that they painted a hopeful picture for us as entrepreneurs.  Hopefully the ripples of the changing investment structures in the Valley will spread to affect the general economy in a few years.",1287365112

I have not seen a case where remotely invoked rsync over ssh was necessary given the type of data it was.  It's mostly a security thing.  With passwordless ssh keys scattered around the network in use by cronjobs, the machines those keys can access are at somewhat more risk.  If you run an rsync server to transfer the files, you know exactly how that can be accessed.  With ssh keys, you have to ensure that, say, certain keys can only do certain things (which is more complex to setup and get right in the authorized keys file).",1287364922

I'm not completely non-technical, but my coding ability is quite limited. I've tried just about every visual programming platform out there and have yet to find something truly intuitive. AppCanvas is no exception (sorry for the bluntness) but I see a lot of potential in it.<p>Non-coders want to put as little effort into development as possible. Otherwise they'd be, well--developers. Starting with a blank canvas and the ability to add little widgets seems like a rather common sense approach to this kind of thing right? It confuses the hell out of us. How do you turn this blank screen into an actual <i>application</i>.<p>Of course education and intuitive UI will help with all of this, but I think you could also benefit by having a better understanding of how non-coders think about software design. I believe it was patio11 who made the comment that visual programming's greatest downfall is that it simply addresses the syntax. The designer still needs to understand the logic and data structures driving the whole thing. For example, I wouldn't just intuitively know that when I sign into a service, I become an object of the 'User' class based on a series of logical tests. This stuff matters.<p>As I said before though, I actually am excited about the potential of this project.
