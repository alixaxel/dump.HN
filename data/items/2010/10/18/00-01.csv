So when I see an insurance company trading at 1/2 their shareholders' equity and the industry average is 1x, that is interesting.<p>I also like to see figures such as returns on invested capital (EBIT/NWC+PP&E), ROE, ROA, and things such as gross margins vs operating margins.<p>I like when I can get both EBIT and EBITDA relatively quickly as well.<p>I really really like to see how the numbers have developed and changed over time. If you go onto Morningstar you can get data on key figures over a 10 year period.

If there was zero chance that you would buy a costless-to-reproduce good at the effective price -- and the effective price includes all the hoops you have to jump through to get it, including search costs -- then obtaining a copy results in no real loss to the rightsholder, but a real gain for you.<p>Societies become rich by encouraging people to take as many such gains-without-loss actions as possible! (And quite a few actions where the gain of some outweighs the loss of others, too.)<p>Of course, having this utilitarian rationalization handy may mean you pretend you wouldn't have paid the higher cost, when in fact, you would have. And, someday the rightsholder may find a way to offer their product at a price you'd take -- perhaps through some form of price discrimination -- in which case, piracy causes a small loss to the rightsholder.<p>But piracy may still be net-welfare-enhancing, because their eventual-loss-at-some-future-price-point may be much smaller than your gain-in-the-meantime.<p>I wouldn't agonize over your situation, as long as you're trying to get legitimate copies. Perhaps you could pick up a legitimate copy when it does become available, or figure out a generalized way to pretend to be a US consumer of digital goods -- VPN, PO Box, CC card? -- whose cost can be amortized over many purchases.

Well, let's take it a step further and find out.<p>It could easily be argued that the same technique of simplification can and should be applied to other areas of our lives. Federal and state laws, rules, and regulations in the U.S. are extremely complex when looked at as a whole, so let's start there. But that is a huge chunk, so let's focus even more: Since tax laws are especially burdensome, and it would seem simple enough to try to simplify them. There have been efforts by many to push for the ""Fair Tax"", ""Flat Tax"", etc. Why hasn't everyone jumped aboard this train?<p>These efforts fail because:<p>1. The people pushing to re-engineer the system would end up causing so much change that many people would lose their jobs (accountants, lawyers, the IRS, etc.) and there would be mass turmoil on top of that prolonged unemployment.<p>2. The same large accounting industry, lawyers, etc. have a good bit of lobbying power. Threatening these people's livelihoods will produce even more serious action if they ever thought it would really happen. Right now they are just on-guard. Imagine what it would look like if they were cornered.<p>How all of this applies to tech:<p>Along with complexity comes process and resources to deal with that complexity. If you let things get complex and they stay that way long enough, you are going to have trouble simplifying. Simplification will almost certainly have detractors come out of the woodwork pushing for the old way of doing things, and if you still follow through, it may end up with a number of people getting let go.<p>Whole industries have sprung up around ISO, CMM, etc. certifications, UML tools, etc. Banks are afraid of giving up the waterfall design/development teams, even if they have other teams doing ""agile"". Even ""agile"" has their folks pushing scrum certification, etc.<p>The way out of this I think is to start over.<p>Start your own company and make your own way. This is the only way to break the cycle.<p>By the same token, government needs to be reinvented if it is to ever be simplified. But, neither revolt nor destruction is the answer. People make fun of people that try to start their own governments within the geographical bounds of other governments, but they are on the right track at least, even if they are a little (or a lot) crazy. But really, there is almost no place on Earth to start anew.<p>So, we need to colonize space. Earth is just going to continue to get more and more screwed up, and the human race needs some chances to start over and simplify.",1287360285

1801809,comment,1801640,1801640,0,0,Natsu,,,"Well, here's how it looks from each of the stakeholder's perspective, as near as I can tell:<p>Artists:  You invest a ton of hard work into making something you're proud of.  Then you make $0.87 because everyone is pirating it (or at least, that's what your distributor tells you).<p>Distributors:  Their primary value these days is in marketing.  So far it's just the web cartoonists who seem to be making a living off their work, but the distributors being supplanted over time.  They're hiring lobbyists and trying to keep their leverage by fighting stuff like Net Neutrality.<p>Users:  I bought a game the other week.  It wouldn't install and gave me some vague nonsense error message like ""Install failed:  try again.""  My best guess is that Starforce DRM was the reason.  I'm out $20.  I'm guessing it twigged on some remnant of a CD drive emulator I used to convert some ISO a long time ago and later uninstalled, but it won't tell me.  I never got to play it.  I could get a crack for it, but all the crap I took from trying to make it work made me hate the game.  Long story short, I returned it.  The non-techie store clerk elected to mark it as ""defective.""  I didn't really feel like contradicting her.<p>Pirates:  You can get anything you want for free.  Unlike the users, your version won't have DRM.  Worries about viruses and such are real, but overrated for people who are reasonably computer savvy.  There's a reason more people transition from user to pirate.<p>Librarians:  They're sitting on some wax cylinders from 1890 that won't go out of copyright until 2067 thanks to a 1972 law that simplified (and extended) audio copyrights.  The Library of Congress report said that they generally have to ignore the law to preserve a lot of historic audio files.<p>Did I miss anyone?",1287360211
