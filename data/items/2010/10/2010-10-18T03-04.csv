I didn't mean to say Ubuntu, actually. I just meant that Linux is a great place for developers because the tools are there (and fantastic). That said, making (say) my Ruby Unix utilities available to my typical audience (my boss... very much on Windows XP) just doesn't work. Instead my workflow goes something like... 1. code a nifty tool to process data, 2. realize that my boss probably doesn't know what a commandline is, and 3. shoot him an e-mail saying ""send me your data files, and I'll have my program analyze them"".

I guarantee the typical Mac or Windows user is not going to install my GTK app on their computer, whether it's portable or not.

I wouldn't have watched the videos if I hadn't been able to stream or download to another player.<p>Both videos played smoothly streamed into VLC with the Open Network command.  The Jobs video clearly had older codecs, the audio was very marginal.  The aspect ratio had to be forced to 16:9 to look right.  For some reason VLC recogonized it as 4:3.<p>It was generally well produced and easy to follow.  The bit about MS investing 150 million in non-voting stock probably should have mentioned the deal including a few other things too - avoiding litigation over the unauthorized copied QuickTime code that had been put in Video For Windows, Apple getting continued Office for Mac updates, MS getting Apple to keep I.E. as the default browser for the minimum term of the investment (3 years)<p>The Facebook video sounded much better and played fine without forcing modes although it displayed as 16:9 inside of 4:3 (black letterbox area seem to be part of video).  For 120 meg and 220 meg, h.264 could have delivered great quality at well above the 320*240 or so those are.  Even phone displays can handle/show much more detail, but the videos didn't look bad.<p>I don't mean to be overly critical, just trying to provide detailed feedback.  I enjoyed watching both videos.  Thank you.<p>Now I see why some say a 250 meg data plan is way too limiting.  The Jobs video alone would nearly eat it up.

Our startup, iTeleport, makes the top grossing VNC-based remote desktop client on the iPhone / iPad.<p>a) We're a team of two people -- myself (I did my CS PhD from CMU) and Vishal Kapur (BS/MS from MIT, and has worked at a large company and a successful startup over the past few years) -- and we're having a lot of fun doing what we're doing.<p>b) We've got traction -- more than 100,000 paying customers @$25 a pop, and growing -- we've even been featured on 37signals' Profitable and Proud blog series.<p>c) Finally, we're working on some incredibly challenging problems all the way from redesigning the user experience (we applied for a patent on our interface hack, which was recently approved) to squeezing every bit of performance juice out of memory and CPU constrained devices when transferring large amounts of graphical data.  We're working on a p2p network stack that enables any endpoint to speak directly with any other endpoint without requiring any servers of our own to manage (and pay for (and worry about)).  Most importantly, we're in touch with our users, we know what they want, and we want to learn how we can continue making something they want and like.  We're making more than $1m in revenues a year, but we feel we've only scratched the surface, and people who join us now are going to really learn an incredible amount about every single aspect of how to build and grow a startup.<p>We're a team of two, and we're looking for a third.  We're very picky, but for the right person, this could be the opportunity of a lifetime.  If anyone's interested, go to iTeleportMobile.com, see what we're all about, and email us from the jobs page.",1287372100

If future Java API's take their queue from JAX-RS then Java will again become competitive. I trained a guy just last week on JAX-RS and had him up and running in less that a day. Only truly elegant designs can provide that level of simplicity while exposing the ability to accomplish the task you want without having to make compromises. JAX-RS is a gem in the Java world and I hope that future Java API's will follow suite.<p>As well Netbeans tooling for JAX-RS goes a long way to reduce development time. You can write a JPA annotated class and Netbeans will gen the schema as well as the REST service. Or you can write the schema and Netbeans will gen the JPA class and the service.

Should authors and publishers be paid by everyone that wants to read their work, or should the books be available freely to all that want them?

The borrowed copy prevents another patron from borrowing at the same time, but this feels more like a physical limitation (and legal loophole) than a morally relevent distinction.<p>People try to place value on making sure that authors get paid, and on making books freely available to all (that live near a library?), while neglecting that these are mostly incompatible with each other.<p>Oh, and the ""I later bought my own copies"" argument is also commonly used in favor of piracy.<p>It's reasons like this that I don't claim any strong opinions on these issues myself.
