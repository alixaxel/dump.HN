1846656,comment,1845918,1845918,0,0,harnhua,,,"(Disclaimer: I was born in Singapore, educated in the US and lived in the SF bay area for a while. Among other things, the overseas experience made me question a lot of things about Singapore and the US)<p>I beg to differ with the article and wonder if I'm a product of the system as the author described or that maybe he just hasn't lived long enough in Singapore. A lot of the content is outdated, in my opinion.<p>May I respectfully give a personal perspective on some remarks that I feel are rather over-the-top. Please let me know if you agree/disagree:<p>> A lot of people ask me what I think a free China would look like. I said possibly very similar to Singapore, and the truth is, there is a lot in common with China.<p>To be frank, I think that could not be further from the truth. As a Singaporean Chinese, I find my way of thinking very different from that of friends and even relatives from mainland China. It has been reported that Deng Xiaoping and other senior members of the Chinese government looked to Singapore for ideas on economic, social and political reform back then, but I think how policies were eventually implemented were very different.<p>> Don't forget to remember the simple guideline that epitomizes Singapore's reaction to lawbreaking on the back of the disembarkation card on the plane in bold, all-caps red letters: ""Welcome to Singapore. Death to drug traffickers under Singapore law.""<p>Like what someone else said, on paper, Singapore looks horrible but in reality, it's just like any other country. I chew gum on the streets, I could leave trash outside of bins if I wanted to, sometimes I forget to flush after using a public restroom... (silly examples but tongue firmly in cheek) all without penalty.<p>On one hand, some laws like the penalties for drug-trafficking seem draconian by comparison. On the other, I wonder if it is because of these strict laws that one is able to wander around alone almost anywhere at night without fear. Or simply, if you don't want to be arrested, don't bring illegal drugs into the country...<p>> Also don't get stuck there with out health cover/travel insurance or you will regret it, its not malaysia/thailand.<p>You're right that on average Malaysia/Thailand heathcare costs are probably cheaper.
Currently I have no health insurance and pay less than US$30 every time I go into a public health clinic for a cold, an annual physical or a dental checkup. A lot of people from the region actually come to Singapore for good, reliable health-care, leading to a medical tourism boom in recent decades.<p>> Challenge the Lee dictatorship and comeback and tell us how little they care.<p>Well, I question government policies openly in public, and so far, I haven't found myself behind bars. Maybe I'm just not important enough ;)<p>Speaking about the government... I wish for more transparency on how the government invests money from its sovereign funds(i.e. taxpayers' money). I hope silly election tactics like redrawing of electoral boundaries won't be used anymore, etc.<p>But I do want the efficient, corruption-free(at certain levels, it still helps if one has the right connections though) bureaucratic processes to continue to flourish.<p>As a startup founder, I found it a breeze to get incorporated(2 days), rent an office and complete the administrative-type tasks. However, innovation certainly seems to be a problem. The jump from years of mainly being indoctrinated with ""trust the government to do the right thing"", ""study hard and be a good worker"" to ""come up with your own ideas!"", ""be unique!""(which ironically, is being promoted by the government!) will take some time, I guess.<p>Government-supported investment funds may abound, but I get the impression that those guys are terribly risk-averse and want to back certain winners.<p>> Singapore Airlines is notorious for discriminating age, sex, and lookgs for its flight attendants.<p>I'm not a fan of Singapore Airlines, but one is certainly free to sue them for discriminatory practices.<p>Pardon my long, at times sarcastic response. I guess I get somewhat annoyed when binary statements are repeatedly made based on things that I think have obvious shades of gray.<p>Anyway, come to Singapore and let's have coffee sometime; I'd love to meet up with fellow HNers and chat about this funny island country of mine!",1288342724

1846618,comment,1845918,1846327,0,0,_delirium,,,"I wouldn't say it's the exact opposite, though it's not libertarian. It does fit into a Hayekian view that government intervention is justified to promote free markets and competition. That's not quite libertarianism, but Hayek fans are often found near libertarian circles.<p>It seems to be somewhat an ends/means disagreement. Many branches of libertarianism argue that government interference with private contracts is inherently wrong. Other pro-capitalist views (Hayek among them), though, focus more on the outcomes, arguing that capitalism is good because competitive markets with decentralized decision-making mediated by price signals produce the best outcomes for humanity. Those holding the latter view don't have as blanket an opposition to all kinds of regulation, but would allow some kinds of regulation that are narrowly tailored towards promoting competitive markets. Adam Smith is probably the earliest precursor of that view; for example, he opposed most regulation, but supported requiring employers to pay wages in silver, because he thought on balance, prohibiting employers from paying their employees in IOUs promoted a functioning market economy, so the interference with the employer's absolute freedom to negotiate payment methods with their employees was justified. Hayek outlined a number of kinds of intervention he felt justified as well.",1288341708

1846610,comment,1844011,1844011,0,0,hyperlexic,,,"I have been trying to teach myself programming for a couple years now, because I got sick of getting a great idea and then having to 1) explain it to the development team, 2) waiting for development 3) iterating through modifications.<p>So as a new programmer with no ambition of paying another fortune for 'university training' I entered the rabbit hole of learning from online resources, videos and books.<p>The signal to noise ratio is abominable, simply because a new programmer doesn't know stink-code from unstink-code. Horrible, exploitable examples of all languages flourish on high traffic sites and sites that rank high for ""$language tutorial"". these get re-pasted on 10,000 s of sites and become 'the way it is done'. You might get some comments in the original post that the author didn't properly secure the code, but rarely will you get that commenter to show the proper way to do it.<p>The gap between 'hello world' and real programming resources   is only getting worse, and it affects the quality of Internet programming in general.<p>You can find a 1000 great tutorials on making cool online forms and widgets using jQuery - but they almost ALL will add the caveat ""obviously for sake of brevity i'm not sanitizing data - you will want to take care of that"". well, maybe we don't need any more tutorials that don't go into the details securing your data, because I'd venture to guess many newbies (like myself in the beginning) will download the demo script and upload it to our shared host and say 'done'. That leaves a lot of vulnerable low hanging fruit that is then re-copied by more people entering programming, and perpetuates the stinkcode that is so ubiquitous that it becomes 'standard'.<p>This leads to another problem newbatroids will face - seeing the same type of applications in tutorials built by the same language over and over. JavaScript (and the awesome jQuery library) is NOT simply an easy way to make cool photo sliders.   We sure don't need any more tutorials on making cool photo sliders and other UI candy with client-side programming languages and libraries that have immense power to do other things-very very cool things. The lack of compelling, interesting examples of what JavaScript can do really limits the overall advance of web development, since newbatroids don't know it's not just for making Fancybox widgets or cool rollover effects or menus and aren't shown the real power of the language. The problem is that these are very common entry points for new programmers. JavaScript can be an incredible tool to teach programming since it's everywhere - free - and full of problems that must be fixed which teach the new programmer the difference between stink and unstink code. Crockford's series of videos and books really opened my eyes to the bigger picture.<p>Another problem newbatrons will face is the inability to decouple UI and 'design' from the programming logic, and by necessity then needing to learn how to do both - which starts to really - really - really - suck after a few big projects. It's easy to say 'split your code into a model, view and controller', but a newbariffic probably isn't a part of team and is hammering together some frankenstein-esque 'thing' made up of photoshop slices, PHP code (maybe formed into functions) and probably cut and paste jquery UI plugins from online resources. maybe they have experienced the fun of the nervous breakdown when a client is asking for heavy modification of a wordpress template and wants it to be pixel perfect with proper typography, and cool features that lead our young programmer into hacking away at variable-quality plugins that may or may not break on the next update.<p>In terms of online free resources/tutorials, it's huge. But there's also a vast gap between the proverbial 'hello world' and real deal programming. I would venture to say many new programmers start with a WAMP like environment, tool around with Wordpress or some other easy publishing platform and then find themselves really struggling to make the leap to 'proper' programming.<p>For one, I would like to see you smart guys help out us wannabe-programmer marketing turds by showing us how to set up a proper development environment - and i mean everything from the machine i run locally - and the software i use to make software -  to 'cloud' based hosting to explaining at least where to start conceptually so i can do my own informed research. Do tutorials in real-world development environments. use linux and the command line. force newbatronics to understand how to properly code from 'hello world' and not even allow a messy windows based environment or plug and play platforms unless that's clearly as far as the programmer wants to go - and for many that's far enough.<p>Probably the most informative exercise I did was building a web app - then trying to hack it from as many ways as i could imagine. I spent a great deal of time learning about client-side security by continuously hacking my own applications and trying to anticipate how a skilled hacker would utilize the seemingly infinite attack surface exposed by bad client-side programming - i was amazed and horrified at how easy it was - and mobile hasn't even really hit yet, but hold on to your hats with that one. but that exercise  taught me so much about programming in general, that it changed the way i conceptualized 'programming'. I thought it was about objects and functions and operators whatnot - but realized how much of it is policies and structure and scope. That could have been stressed more in my opinion from the popular online programming sites, but i guess it's easier to get traffic with the headline '50 mindblowing jQuery photo sliders' rather than 'stop using global variables and learn about function scope'.",1288341578
