The comment was meant to be tongue-in-cheek but I guess it didn't come across that way.<p>I guess what I was getting at is that no other browser has websites dedicated to its demise, logging the number of hours lost, or the like. Although I realize that much of this comes from earlier versions of the browser that is supposedly going to be addressed in the IE9 which is currently scoring a 95 on the ACID3 in the most recent release, it took awhile to get there.<p>Also, that seems surprising to me that standards support is considered a feature. Now with the full disclosure that I have absolutely no experience developing a browser or anything nearly on that scale it seems surprising that developing something the way it is laid out by an organization such as the W3C (say what you will about html5) would be considered highly optional, and in that case upper/middle management should prioritize this.<p>The fact that things like the IE=EmulateIE7 meta tag even exist shows that there is something inherently broken.<p>I guess devs was the wrong word to use, what I meant was that MS should seriously take a look at the browser landscape and figure out what it can do to help its developers. Every time I work on a front end and I get frustrated by IE inconsistencies, that's one more time that I'm cursing Microsoft... and that is not good for business.",1287993487

In New Zealand, where I'm from, helmets are required by law, and in my experience everybody wears helmets while cycling - it's just an accepted part of riding a bike there. Here in Europe, though, people ride with or without them and it's quite odd. Sure, they look cool without a helmet, but I just can't help but cringe when I imagine them having a nasty spill.<p>The one thing I'd disagree with about this helmet is its invisibility - it doesn't encourage other people to wear one. I don't know whether that's marketing advice or safety advice, but having everybody wear visible helmets sets a strong example.",1287992873

One thing to point out is that there are grades of things. There is ""public"", and then there is ""top hit on Google"". Similarly, there is ""insecure"" and then there is ""simple doubleclick tool to facilitate identity theft"".<p>How many millions of dollars and man hours is it going to take to lock down every access point? How many new servers are going to be needed now that https is used for everything and requests can't be cached?<p>America was a better place when people could keep their doors unlocked, and when someone's first response to a break-in was to blame the <i>criminal</i>. By contrast it's fashionable among a certain set (no doubt including the author of this mess, Mr. Butler himself) to hold that the real culprits are the door manufacturers. What said facile analysis excludes, of course is that there is <i>always</i> a greater level of security possible. The level we currently employ reflects our tradeoffs between the available threats and the cost/convenience loss of bolting our doors and putting finials on our gates.<p>Butler has simply raised the threat level for everyone. He did not invent a new lock or close a hole. He's now forcing lots of people to live up to <i>his</i> level of security. Congratulations to the new Jason Fortuny.",1287992852

1828896,comment,1827886,1828283,0,0,SpacemanSpiff,,,"A switch mode power supply can do a whole lot more than act as a rectifier. ""Switch mode"" refers to the turning on and off of numerous silicon switches usually connected to some kind of LC energy storage/filter, and this is the basis of modern rectifiers, inverters, step-up and step-down converters, etc.<p>It is in fact possible to use a switching circuit to convert an arbitrary ac voltage/frequency to another arbitrary ac voltage/frequency directly without a DC link intermediary. This is called a ""matrix converter.""
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/AC_converter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC/AC_converter</a><p>So it should theoretically be possible to take say 200VAC at 400 Hz and convert this to 120VAC 60Hz. In fact this would probably be more compact/less expensive than the usual inverters mentioned in this article, since these are usually meant to be powered by a low voltage DC source and thus have to deal with taking a low voltage and very high current and first stepping this up to several hundred volts, then modulate it into an AC sine wave. A matrix converter (or even AC-DC-AC converter) would have no such requirement if it were powered from the already high voltage aircraft power bus.<p>At this point I think it's a matter of the technology catching up, since this is a highly specialized application that has just recently become an opportunity for innovation.<p>EDIT:
Also - 240W per person? This seems outrageously high as a baseline load. I would estimate more like 50-100W per person on average, with 300W peak (like when the power supply is first plugged in.) The peak loads would not all happen at once unless everyone decides to plug in and turn on their computers at once, in which case the power limiting would kick in...",1287990799

Although nowadays you can buy most vegan stuff from regular supermarket, they are still kind of marginal products and priced accordingly. E.g. soya milk costs more than 2 €/L, while cow-milk is less than 1 euro (IIRC). This is in Finland, Europe.<p>The funny part is, that most of soya produced worldwide is used to feed the livestock, i.e. converted to meat at pretty bad efficiency rate. So, soya per se is not expensive, and I'm pretty sure soya products could be cheaper than their animal-based counterparts, if produced on a (comparable) mass-scale.<p>(Then again, the ""cheap"" concept used here assumes that the suffering of animals has no price, which is not true for most vegans/vegetarians.)",1287990728

A resource that represents ""The last 10 items processed"" will always contain just that, even if the response is different at the html level. This is why cache-invalidation is important.<p>A resource can also be composed of parts of other resources. For instance, you can have an order resource which is composed of item resources that each have their own url.<p>I think the rails flash is usually used to send a user a message which will only be seen once on the very next request. Think of the message as a resource that isn't important enough to get it's own url, and every resource as a composite of the actual item they are looking for and an optional ""message"" resource. The message resource isn't important enough to store into permanent storage. It could be stored into the db backend and then loaded up on the next request, and then deleted once the user has seen it. In practice that's not practical so it's kept in memory.<p>I don't think it breaks the internet at all.",1287990093
