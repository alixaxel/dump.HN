I've done a lot of business with still photographers for film projects, so they're pretty current. The camera is just the recorder. The 'look' requires 3 lights, some assistance from a makeup artist/stylist, and a sense of what you are trying to project as well as what makes you distinctive and which parts you want to emphasize, or not. If you don't have great taste in clothes, bribe a lady friend who does to take you shopping. What you like/dislike about the way you look/dress is not necessarily what appeals to others.<p>Have a few similarly themed choices - if you are a suit-and-tie guy, then you want a few different combinations, plus a few shots of just shirt and tie, or sleeves rolled up (for those 'straight talk with jdavid' articles) and one with your collar loosened 'jdavid's 2 cents'). Also you want a mix of closeup (head & shoulders) and medium (waist up) shots to give to magazines and blogs. Eventually one characteristic shot may become the best known, but it might not be the one you expect - have several and rotate them to find out what your readers like. Don't limit yourself to one great shot, or you'll seem one-dimensional.

1789180,comment,1788932,1789091,0,0,stratomorph,,,"While I agree with you about decentralization, onboard solar cells won't ever do the trick. Even for a home-sized array, I'm not sure it can be made practical. Here are some back-of-the-envelope figures:<p>To really replace a gasoline-powered vehicle, an electric car needs a similar amount of energy at its disposal. My car (a 92 Accord) holds about 16 gallons of gas. Figure it's about 50% efficient, and gasoline holds about 45 MJ/kg, and that's <i>about</i> 1 gigajoule of usable energy in a full tank. So to charge my car (without running the house at all) I have to collect and store 1e9 joules during the daylight hours. That's <i>about</i> 12 kW, if it could run 24 hours a day. According to Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cells"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cells</a>), a solar system can produce about 20% of its peak rating, so I need a system rated for about 60 kW at noon, in order to average 12 kW through the night. Assuming a reasonable conversion efficiency of 20%, that means I need to actually intercept 300 kW of sunlight. Wikipedia uses a figure of 1000 W/m^2 in that article, so I'd need a 300 square meter panel. In units familiar to me, that's pushing 60 feet square. Large for a house, never will fit the car.<p>Such a large system just to charge a car seems impractical to me. We can tweak parameters and dramatically shrink that size, since after all I would hardly ever need to charge the car from an empty battery, but someone who drives a larger vehicle over a longer commute might realistically have such high demand. (We could also argue about the size of the vehicles, but this is America: Suburbans aren't going away in my lifetime.)<p>That said, charging the car overnight would use vastly more energy than my house does on a daily basis. Solarizing the house is getting more practical, especially since the grid's always connected.",1287009871

1789177,comment,1786959,1786959,0,0,v21,,,"I read in the Code Book that this was how Clifford Cocks ended up inventing asymmetric cryptography. In fact, I recently took my books out of storage and put them on some shelves, so I can quote exactly.<p>""For the next three years, GCHQ's brightest minds struggled to find a one-way function that satisfied Ellis's requirements, but nothing emerged. Then, in September 1973, a new mathematician joined the team. Clifford Cocks had recently graduated from Cambridge University, where he had specialised in number theory, one of the purest forms of mathematics. When he joined GCHQ he knew very little about encryption and the shadowy world of military and diplomatic communication, so he was assigned a mentor, Nick Patterson, who guided him through his first few weeks at GCHQ.<p>After about six weeks, Patterson told Cocks about 'a really whacky idea'. He outlined Ellis's theory for public-key cryptography, and explained that nobody had yet been able to find a mathematical function that fitted the bill. Patterson was telling Cocks because this was the most titillating cryptographic idea around, not because he expected him to try to solve it. However, as Cocks explains, later that day he set to work: 'There was nothing particular happening, and so I thought I would think about the idea. Because I had been working in number theory, it was natural to think about one-way functions, something you could do but not undo. Prime numbers and factoring was a natural candidate, and that became my starting point.' Cocks was beginning to formulate what would be known as the RSA asymmetric cipher. Rivest, Shamir and Adleman discovered their formula for public-key cryptography in 1977, but four years earlier the young Cambridge graduate was going through exactly the same thought processes. Cocks recalls: 'From start to finish, it took me no more than half an hour. I was quite pleased with myself. I thought, ""Ooh, that's nice. I've been given a problem, and I've solved it."" '<p>Cocks did not fully appreciate the significance of his discovery. He was unaware of the fact that GCHQ's brightest minds had been struggling with the problem for three years, and had no idea that he had made one of the most important cryptographic breakthroughs of the century. Cocks's naivety may have been part of the reason for his success, allowing him to attack the problem with confidence, rather than timidly prodding at it. Cocks told his mentor about his discovery, and it was Patterson who then reported it to the management. Cocks was quite diffident and very much still a rookie, whereas Patterson fully appreciated the context of the problem and was more capable of addressing the technical questions that would inevitably arise. Soon complete strangers started approaching Cocks the wonderkid, and began to congratulate him. One of the strangers was James Ellis, keen to meet the man who had turned his dream into a reality. Because Cocks still did not understand the enormity of his achievement the details of this meeting did not make a great impact on him, and so now, over two decades later, he has no memory of Ellis's reaction.""<p>Note that it wasn't just his naivete that helped, it was also his deep knowledge of a field incidental to where the solution was thought to lie. You gotta know some shit, too.",1287009735

I'm one of those more strict JS disable people, but feel free to correct me if I see things wrong.<p>1) Using JavaScript is insecure: Without doubt JS had security holes in the past, and they continue to show up.<p>2) JavaScript is a privacy threat: This has a lot to do with what you define as privacy. To my knowledge it is possible to track my cursor in the entire website, while I'm on it. This is a example of what I call a privacy issue. Some people my not care about that. Interactive parts of a website always expose the way I interact with it. Sometimes this is fine, because the product needs it to function.<p>3) JavaScript saves bandwidth: I think that not so much because of the initial load of a webpage. JS enables a webpage to costantly query back to the server. An example is gmail, and the notification for a new email, while you are logged into gmail.<p>People should not take this too personal. If your webpage is truthfully, or offers something I'm eager to use, I'll give it to you.",1287009297

For example, I might read your facebook feed (if I didn't hate facebook) because I know you, but I'm not going to go read some randos facebook feed.

If you look at preceieved sense of authority, trust drops almost 2 fold when its a ""friend of a friend- instead of a friend. You run the risk of having all of these ""cells of authority"" that don't interact.<p>But the good news is, traditional forms of authority can solve this problem. People seek out and read content all of the time that isn't recommended by their friends. They read it because they think its a good source of information.

You want people to have shared web channels that people read like they read tech crunch or the wall street journal.

It seems like lots of people ""want"" to be rich, but when they see somebody who's actually making lots of money, out comes the resentment.<p>So many people are incapable of thinking beyond gut reactions of jealous or hatred that somebody is ""getting one over on them"" to realize the value that one might get from such a thing, at such a price.<p>It's really sad, because a lot of the people with that particular reaction are otherwise very, very smart. But you can never make a great business, if that's your true mindset (underneath what you say). They will always feel like they are doing evil in the world by merely selling, or marketing.",1287007424

Self-reference for later, and also, just so your friends have a place to browse it if they want to. I could tell a friend, yah go check out all the advice I've read on pitching - there's lots of good stuff there in my 'pitching' channel :). For those people, they now have a place to browse what you've seen, and they can thank you for posting it, and respond.<p>The nice thing, is that we're working on ways to make the categorization as automatic as possible (e.g. via crowdsourcing etc) - so that for you its easy to say you saw it, and then it goes into the appropriate topic.<p>We're also thinking about the ways to differentiate between the links that stand out, and the ones that don't in the long term. For example, based on your friends' reaction to it, your own indication of its importance, and other metrics. That way, this becomes a more useful showcase and memory of your web experience.",1287007373
1789076,comment,1788122,1788122,0,0,keithwarren,,,"Flame war cometh? The feedback to Joel was based on PHP being so inefficient but I think that could not explain half of it. I think technically it is a combination of the fact that PHP is slow and asp.net mvc with sql is much faster/more efficient (when done right) than people can imagine. Those factors might explain 20% of it but I think the most important factor is the fact that Jeff Atwood and team are wickedly good programmers who have grown the site not under the auspices of grow as fast as we can but rather they have been methodical about their choices. Jeff wrote recently about going 'that way fast and if something gets in your way, turn' and while that is probably true in a macro sense - they are just in a different league. I truly believe that a great hacker can produce 10x the average lackey and there is probably an imbalance over at Digg in this factor.",1287007355

We want to enable marketers to run A/B tests without having to rely on engineering or IT.<p>Great feedback on the pricing model. I agree this isn't perfect.
