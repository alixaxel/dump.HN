Most languages which implement sets as a library make some assumption about the elements: they're ordered, for example, or they all have a unique string serialization. If you want to make a set data type in JavaScript, the language doesn't give you any of those assumptions. You might end up just using linear search of unordered arrays.

1770098,comment,1769761,1769909,0,0,jules,,,"Would it be too difficult to keep a state for every badge that you update when a new checkin happens? You'd need some specialized logic for every badge, but not much more complex than you already have. Depending on how much space you save it could be worth it.<p>E.g. for ""you've seen foo 4 times today"" you'd keep a list of the foos visited. When a new foo comes in you first remove the foos older than 1 day from the list, and insert the new foo. If the list now contains 4 foos you award the badge.<p>You can use a bitvector to record the badges that have any active state at all, so for badges that have no state associated with them yet (e.g. no foos seen yet) you only pay 1 bit. Or if very few badges have active state on average you could use a list of badges that have state instead of a bitvector, so that you only pay for badges that actually have active state. So total storage is 1 bit per badge or less + a couple of bytes per badge with active state?",1286498105

1770089,comment,1769761,1769900,0,0,wheels,,,"I don't think those are the same problem -- could you provide a link?<p>The problem isn't paging, per se -- the paging system is doing exactly what it should be doing, paging in blocks off of the disk and into memory as they become hot, which for this use case is always.<p>The problem is that you get fragmentation in your pages.  If you allocate three records in a row that are 300 bytes, and then need to rewrite the first one to make it 400 bytes, or delete it altogether, you end up creating a hole there.<p>The typical strategy for dealing with those holes it to maintain a list of free blocks which can be used and hope that the distribution of incoming allocations neatly fits into unused chunks.<p>However, as they note, if you have a fully compacted 64 GB active data set and remove 5% of it you just end up with address space that looks like swiss cheese; it's not set up to elegantly shrink, but to recycle space as it grows.<p>There are a couple of things that I find a bit odd here though:  they should have seen this coming before migrating data; it's pretty obvious from the architecture.  Second is that they mention the solution being auto-compacting, which wouldn't have actually helped them.<p>Auto-compaction is in fact useful, but all that it does is, well, compact stuff.  It means they would have hit the limits later, but once the threshold was crossed, they'd have the exact same problem.  Auto-compaction is either an offline process that runs in the background or a side-effect of smarter allocation algorithms.  Both of those things need time once you remove data from an instance to reclaim the holes in the address / memory / disk space ... which is exactly what they did manually.<p>The only really sane ways to handle something like this are notifications at appropriate levels, or block-aware data removal -- e.g. ""give me stuff from the end of the file"".  I don't know if mongo uses continuation records and stuff like that enough to know how difficult that would be for them.<p>(Note: Directed Edge's graph database uses a similar IO scheme, so I'm doing some projecting of our architecture onto theirs, but I assume that the problems are very similar.)",1286497951

The most comprehensive overview of the replay format is the wiki[1] for Lauri Virkamaki's phpsc2replay project. Head and shoulders above everything else I found, which were mainly random forum threads.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/phpsc2replay/w/list"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/phpsc2replay/w/list</a>",1286496187

(Woz and Paul Allen are played straightforwardly, and Ballmer is recognizably Ballmer.)<p>It's quite notable that <i>Pirates</i> tells a broader and more interesting story than <i>The Social Network</i> despite <i>The Social Network</i> being far more fictionalized.<p>If you're looking for parallels to contemporary startups, <i>The Social Network</i> is a bit more on point--<i>Pirates</i> goes farther back into the founders' backgrounds and forward into the lives of Apple and Microsoft as established companies. But both are still great.",1286496181

The company I work at has been using Mongo for a while, and anytime we've had an issue, Eliot has been right there to help us. Mongo is a great product, but like anything, it has its limits. Learning those limits and taking the time to plan your infrastructure is a mandatory part of adopting any technology, and Mongo is no exception.<p>On a more technical note, it would be nice to have a way to compact indexes online without having to resort to doing so on a slave, but Mongo is a minimum two server product to begin with, so it's not the end of the world. Overall it's a great datastore, and it's only going to get better in the next few years.",1286496110
