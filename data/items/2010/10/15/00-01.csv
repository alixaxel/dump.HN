It made huge sense to me that if one person in a community has money and one person in a community needs money, then if they trust each other, one guy pays a modest APR and everyone walks away happy.<p>As it turns out, Prosper couldn't beat the payday loan companies because the people who need payday loans are atrocious credit risks and they collectively relieved us lenders of hundreds of millions (cough, not a typo) before we wised up about this.",1287104295

Right now, IANA's root name servers delegate all .ly requests to name servers under Libya's control. I'm pretty sure there's no mechanism in place for the root servers to change that to ""send all .ly requests to Libya _except for_ bit.ly requests, and serve them ourselves or send them elsewhere"", and in my opinion there _shouldn't_ be any such mechanism because of the potential for abuse at government levels - would you want the Chinese government to know IANA has the ability to redirect traffic from domains they don't like?<p>So the _other_ alternative seems to be to have IANA refer all .ly requests to a new tld authority. Same problem - if you do that once, especially if you do it just to protect a company's profits/business model, how do you refuse a request from China to assume control of all of Tibet's tld?<p>Suggesting DNS level changes for bit.ly seems to me to open a whole can of very ugly worms...",1287103993

But other advice such as ""be a nice guy,"" typically is downright wrong.<p>I am aware that both of the above examples for and against the advice of girls could be picked apart as ""straw man"" arguments. I won't even say for sure if it's 50/50 chances or 60/40 chances of good advice to bad advice. I do know that the advice is bad advice often enough that guys should instead seek the advice of alpha males than girls themselves.<p>It's like product management. Yes, of course you ask the user what they want, but you take whatever they say with a grain of salt, because rarely does a user know what they really want. Instead you should seek the advice of those product managers that are best at creating a product (i.e. men that are successful with the ladies) that the customers (i.e. women) love and can't get enough of.<p>Girls often say they want one thing when they really want something entirely different. Their advice should always be treated as suspect, if only for the very truth that <i></i>there are no universal likes and dislikes when it comes to women.<i></i> As far as I can tell, it's the most fragmented market of buyers in the world.",1287103977

1793203,comment,1792353,1792353,0,0,grellas,,,"The loser-pays rule can often work hardship on average people caught up in the court system.<p>Fee awards can be devastating to a middle-class person. I once had a case come to me after some homeowners had lost at trial in a dispute with their mortgage lender over some technical provisions of their mortgage. The amount at stake was perhaps a couple of hundred thousand dollars. However, on losing, the court awarded the lender almost $400K in fees (it did so under a contract provision providing that the prevailing party in any dispute would receive an award of such fees). It seemed pretty clear that the court had rendered some doubtful rulings in the case and that the case would likely be reversed on appeal. However, in order to get to an appeal, the losing parties needed to get a stay on execution of the judgment. To get the stay, they had to post a bond in an amount equal to no less than one and one-half times the amount of the judgment. Since this was beyond the financial means of the losing plaintiffs, they found themselves being subjected to liens, attachments, garnishments, and the like in ways that basically ruined their day-to-day lives long before they could await the outcome of any appeal. As a result, though they were probably right on the merits, all it took was the harsh acts of one judge to render them helpless in asserting their rights by being able to pursue their case to its proper outcome. They had scraped to pay their own attorneys to prosecute the case but they were overwhelmed by the attorney-fee award that crippled their case midstream.<p>That example involved, not poor people, but those who had homes and jobs and who felt they needed to try to undo a wrong that had been inflicted on them by a lender. The result was that they folded their case, borrowed from wherever they could to pay the lender's fees, and dropped their appeal, walking away licking some pretty heavy wounds.<p>Based on many such situations, I would say that a loser-pays rule could easily work hardship on average people seeking access to the courts. I will grant that such a rule sounds attractive in principle and our courts are full of abusive litigation that needs to be curbed. But I'm just not sure that this is the right approach to reforming the problems.",1287102442
