Not only does Microsoft have to guard against design-by-committee from within, it has to deal with the same from the carriers.

By requiring that the analytics provider has had the code pen tested and testing it ourselves?<p>Ultimately you can't. For example, you include script src=""<a href=""http://some-analytics-server/foo.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://some-analytics-server/foo.js</a> - at no point can you assert on behalf of your end user that the contents of foo.js are not malicious. Even if it was penetration tested that only provides a snapshot in time. There's no reason why the .js requested in one request should be the same in all and there's no real means to provide any assurance of it's integrity.<p>As for my second point if you look at Google Analytics' code you'll see ga.js invoked as in a script src. This means that the code is executed in the browser. That URL <i>could</i> contain anything (although it's unlikely to in the case of Google without people noticing, the fact is you have no control over the content or protection of that content and have to adjust your risk assessment model accordingly to take that into account). It could contain a picture of a horse, it could redirect your users to goatse.cx, it could read the contents of the page it's loaded on (depending upon browser and server configuration), strip out the bits it wants and submit to another server somewhere. You just don't know.<p>Another thing worth thinking about is that some browsers (thankfully not most modern ones as far as I know) will execute javascript in an img src tag if sufficiently seduced by malicious code.",1286882639

Readable content functionality is based on Arc90 Lab's readability code (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability/</a>).<p>I'm also looking for feedback and feature requests.",1286881700

If they are developing an automated car that requires little to no human interference then surely the design would be completely different if all cars on the road were automated.<p>The biggest hurdle appears to be human error. 'What about drunk drivers who drive on to your side of the road etc'. My question is, what if all cars are automated? Zero drunk drivers, minimal risk of encountering unpredictable driving behaviour, much easier and safer to implement.<p>It will get to a point, during our lifetime, where humans controlling a car are limited to private race tracks. Speeding, drink drivers, poor driving ability, insurance premiums, all of these will push automation to the forefront in no time at all.",1286881403

While I admit Walmart's logo isn't exciting or compelling, it's far from 'bad'.  And determining that anything ever done with a certain piece of software is 'bad' is so obviously wrong that I don't know where to begin.<p>If MS Paint can produce beautiful art, Powerpoint presentations can have good graphic design.<p>I realize that these were likely jokes, but you lose your audience when you go too far.  They stop having confidence in the entire rest of your presentation.  At this point, I have to suspect every sentence is a joke.",1286881394
