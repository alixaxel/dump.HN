1797090,comment,1795415,1795415,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I disagree with him, but there's merit in what he says. Let me give you an example.<p>I had coffee in an NGO-operated cafe in Siem Riep, Cambodia. All profits went to running a small school for 10 kids.<p>I did the quick math on a napkin, and realized they were doing far worse as an NGO/charity than they would be to help people as a for-profit business.<p>Observe: With a 20% net profit after all expenses (which I think they had, if not higher), they'd be able to have enough of a downpayment to open a second cafe within less than a year. A year after that, they'd have 4-5 cafes opened. In three years total, they could be around 8-12 cafes.<p>At that point, they'd be producing 12 times as much income. They'd also be employing 12 times as many people, and working in a cafe is a <i>really</i> good job in Cambodia. (Air conditioning, pleasant working conditions, friendly client base, regular hours, not dangerous - unlike most Cambodian work).<p>But by paying it all out right away, they have much less impact. What they're doing is good, yes, but they might be being a little shortsighted if their goal is to do the greatest good. Currently, they were employing 10 people or so (plus the people who did construction, installation, painting, decoration of the cafe, etc) If they reinvested profits for 4 years, they could be employing 120 people who all get better wages and working conditions who can help their families, and they'd be generating 12 times as much in profit. At that point, if they started getting 1/10th of what they were making to charity, they'd be giving more than they are with one cafe.<p>Consider that. As a charity, they operate one location, employ 10 people, and educate 10 children. If they ran it as a business, in only four years they could run 12 locations, employ 120 people, and with <i>only a fraction of their profits</i> could educate 12 children. Plus, they'd still have the other 90% of profits to open more cafes, or other businesses, or to help more people, or to open hospitals, or whatever. I've heard similar critiques from a local Khmer businessman and an Indian engineer/restaurant owner I met there. NGO's, while well intentioned, might be stifling development in Cambodia. Maybe. At the very least, running that cafe for-profit and reinvesting profits would've produced a hell of a lot more good very quickly.",1287194213

1797035,comment,1791718,1794505,0,0,Dove,,,"G.K. Chesterton, in <i>Orthodoxy</i>, talked about the problem with crazy people.  Talk to someone who believes crazy things -- say, a conspiracy theorist or a cultist -- and you will find that they are not, as you might suppose, without reason.  They have a reason for everything.  Indeed, they have too much reason -- an answer for every question, an explanation for every objection, a reason for everything from why their legs hurt to why the stars twinkle.  The government did it.<p>It's easy to make up stories to explain experience.  And they can be ruthlessly consistent stories.  But the problem is that many of them are clearly wrong.  One of the hallmarks of a crazy worldview is that it's flat and simple, playing the same notes over and over again, going back to the same explanations for everything.  The person who believes the government is out to get him will use that as an explanation for <i>everything</i>, so his world is really quite shallow and sorry, telling only one sad little story.<p>Reality is not like that.  It is complex and grand.<p>G. K. Chesterton talked about how to avoid this fate, and how to help people suffering it.  The answer isn't to reason with them in their dark little rooms in a corner of reality.  That does no good; they just run around their little well-trodden circuits.  The answer is to go outside, get some fresh air, experience some of grandeur and complexity of the broader world.<p>I have actually had this experience myself.  I was raised a young earth creationist, and from an early age was taught that anyone who believed in evolution must be very stupid, as it was so transparently rediculous and there were so many absurdities to it.  I never questioned the proposition -- in retrospect quite silly -- that so many people beleived something so obviously false.<p>When I was in college, I took it upon myself to study the topic at a college level.  I studied young earth creationists and old earth creationists and intelligent design and theistic evolution and naturalistic evolution.  I learned about paleontology and biology and geology and astrophysics and philosophy and who knows what else.  My husband was pursuing a degree in mathematical biology, studying mechanisms for spontaneous speciation, so I had some help from him.<p>And while it didn't take long for me to discard my young earth background -- a week or so, as I remember -- I expected that with a little bit of further study I could find the correct view.  How hard could it be for an evidential person willing to commit a couple of years to the problem?<p>But I found that the more I studied it, the deeper the rabbit hole went.  There is some <i>weird</i> stuff in origins.  I mean really weird.  The ancient landscape is alien, the history is remote.  Folks from several sides made arguments I found persuasive, and after about three years of study, I came to the conclusion that nobody had the whole story.  I resolved to consider it an open problem.<p>The journey from my very simplistic viewpoint to the one in which I was overawed by the sheer <i>complexity</i> of reality was a long and difficult one, and I had to part with some cherished beliefs.  That is a painful thing to do, especially when they're beliefs that tell you you're smarter than everyone who believes differently, and that's something that's important to you.<p>Since then, I have resolved to follow Chesterton's advice -- to seek out strange ideas and happenings, to have respect for the richness and complexity of the real world.  ""There are more things on heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.""  That is my anthem.  The world is a wonderous place, and I welcome experiences that further open my eyes to it, that challenge my simple beliefs.<p>Where am I going with this?<p>For all of that experience, I am a Christian, on what I think are solid evidential grounds.  And in most contexts I am considered a smart person, though I don't know that I particularly stand out on Hacker News. But there is a group of folks I run into time and again, frequently on the internet, who find it confusing that someone like me could believe such things as that.<p>When I was in grad school, one of the other students asked me what I was studying.  I replied that while my coursework consisted of mathematics, outside of that I was also seriously pursuing computer science and theology.  When I mentioned theology, he laughed and said, ""That shouldn't take long!""  In point of fact, I considered it the most demanding of the three subjects.<p>This reaction is common coming from atheists of a certain type.  It is the idea that Christian ideas are simple and nonsensical, that Christian scholars are humbugs or hoodwinked, their work clever in a sad way.  That Christians in general are not very smart, for how can they believe what they do, given all the obvious absurdities?<p>With utmost respect to the folks who believe this, I find it sad, and it makes me think of my days as a creationist.  The world is just not as simple as you think it is.  Christianity -- let alone all of religion! -- is a grand and complex and multifaceted thing, and whether or not you believe in it, there are wonderous and amazing ideas therein.  Even if it is false, you do yourself an intellectual disservice to hold such a simple concept of it.<p>I have had wonderful dialogues with atheists over the years, and while I think they're <i>wrong</i>, I have found their ideas enriching.  I would not understand God as well as I do were they not continually harping upon the problem of evil and suffering and forcing me to think about it.  I suspect atheists who talked with intelligent Christians would be similarly enriched -- if not convinced, exposed to ideas worth thinking about.  If you think theology is simple and straightforward and unenlightening, you really do not know what you are missing.<p>I extend you two invitations.<p>One is a shot in the dark.  There is a contemporary professional philosopher named Alvin Plantinga, and he is Catholic.  Most folks who hold this view have no idea he exists (but you might -- that's why it's a shot in the dark).  He is an engaging fellow, smart and interesting.  And while I do not always find him persuasive, he makes good arguments.  If you think there are no good philosophical arguments for Christianity or no smart and rational Christians, google him and read some of his work.  His wikipedia entry is a good place to start, to whet your appetite.  I promise, he ain't no C.S. Lewis.  He will expose you to some novel and chewy Christian ideas.<p>The other invitation is personal.  I'm not professionally trained in Christian apologetics, but I am a layman who likes to think and read, and someone who likes to air out the mind.  Send me an email with your most interesting atheistic idea -- you know, some really meaty stumper, some obvious absurdity that it makes no sense for Christians to swallow.  And in my turn, I promise to show you some ideas and events and people that you have absolutely no idea existed -- help to air out your mind a bit.  I promise to be interesting and intelligent, to respect the rules of rational discourse, not to attempt to convert you, and to generally try to make sure you have a good time.<p>It is a sad thing to be trapped in a simplistic little idea when reality is such a grand place.",1287192808

1797029,comment,1796030,1796030,0,0,grellas,,,"As a lawyer, I can't give advice over a forum such as this for your specific case but I would suggest two things:<p>1. This one is complex enough that you should see a competent lawyer in your jurisdiction to confirm technical points such as who owns the code, whether an oral partnership exists (see, e.g., my comments on this at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1645130"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1645130</a> for an analysis of this sort of issue under California law), whether you would or would not have a right to use your code for other work without obligation to your former co-founder, and (above all, given what your co-founder is asking) whether your co-founder has any legal leverage to force you to sign the ""nda"" or to do whatever else he is trying to force you to do.<p>2. Most important, I consider what I would advise a hypothetical person in the position of your <i>co-founder</i> as an abstract proposition: you don't have possession of the code and did not develop it or pay value to have it developed on your behalf; you have no work-for-hire agreement giving you rights to the IP, meaning that in your best case you may have only an implied license to use it and nothing more; you came up with the idea but most ideas are not protectable as such unless they are patentable; you might have a claim against your departing co-founder on a theory that you disclosed a trade secret to him in confidence as part of a proposed alignment that never occurred and, on that ground, might be able to claim that he misappropriated a valuable trade secret from you if that secret is truly proprietary and gives you a significant competitive advantage; the foregoing will not apply if the idea is of a type that is being pursued by others, as this puts it in the public domain and vitiates its trade-secret status; you may be held to have waived confidentiality by disclosing this trade secret to your erstwhile partner without having him sign a confidentiality agreement in connection with the disclosure; to enforce this claim, you would need to spend potentially thousands of dollars in a lawsuit fighting over it; in the meantime, your ability to do <i>anything</i> with your idea would be severely impaired because you would have to explain to anyone who wanted to join your early-stage company that you would be devoting major portions of your limited startup resources to an expensive legal fight or, alternatively, that a cloud hangs over your venture in the form of a possible major legal claim by your former co-founder; this sort of thing is virtual death for most startups and serves to dissuade both prospective co-founders and investors from becoming involved with your company; and, last but not least, unless your erstwhile co-founder capitulates and signs documents giving you a clear path to go forward, he can simply sit and wait and potentially assert partnership and other claims against your company at any time it builds significant value, subject only to the running of the applicable statutes of limitations and to certain equitable doctrines that don't him to lay back forever in hopes of potentially sandbagging you. Likely advice to him: ""Therefore, threaten away - your main leverage at this point is simply to intimidate.""<p>Given the above, I agree with the many good comments in this thread that it is probably not wise to get embroiled in a legal fight over this situation - <i>yet</i>, this doesn't mean you shouldn't consider using use the leverage you do have to negotiate, if possible, a mutual walk-away that gives you a workable path to use your code in a separate venture entirely, as for example by signing documents that give each party the right to pursue this independently going forward without obligation to the other party. This may or may not be a good option but you should discuss it with your lawyer to see if it might be effective here.",1287192569

Usually they're actually talking about an informal requirement (a software developer needs to know what the client wishes the software to do).<p>This leads to sharing my favourite definitions of requirements and specifications; they are from Practical Cryptography by Niels Ferguson and Bruce Schneier.<p>Chapter 9, Pages 131-132.<p>""Requirements<p>Requirements are an informal description of what the program is supposed to achieve.  It is really a ""what can I do with it"" document, rather than a ""how exactly do I do something with it"" document.  Requirements are often a bit vague and leave details out in order to concentrate on the larger picture.<p>Functional specification<p>The functional specifications give a detailed and exhaustive definition of the behavior of the program.  The functional specification can only specify things that you can measure on the outside of the program.<p>For each item in the functional specifications, ask yourself whether you could create a test on the finished program that would determine whether tat item was adhered to or not.  The test can only use the external behavior of the program, not anything from the inside.  If you can't create a test for an item, it does not belong in the functional specification.<p>The functional specification should be complete.  That is, every piece of functionality should be specified.  Anything not in the functional specification does not have to be implemented.<p>Another way to think of the functional specification is as the basis for testing the finished program.  Any item can, and should, be tested.<p>Implementation Design<p>This document has many names, but it specifies how the program works internally.  It contains all of the things that cannot be tested from the outside.  A good implementation design will often split the program into several modules, and describe their functionality.  In turn, these modules descriptions can be seen as the requirements for the module, and the whole cycle starts all over again for the module.""",1287191098

1796971,comment,1795415,1795987,0,0,blahblahblah,,,"Another important point regarding disease, in general, and especially malaria is that disease often leaves survivors with permanent physical disabilities and/or neurological deficits.  I think a lot of people in the U.S. and Europe have this mistaken notion that malaria is like a bad case of influenza, mononucleosis, pneumonia, or some other common disease that we are familiar with.  We think that the person gets really sick and feels awful and it could even be life-threatening, but that as long as you survive it, you fully recover.  That simply isn't true.<p>Malaria primarily affects children and many survivors have severe permanent disabilities because of it (seizure disorders, deficits caused by stroke, psychiatric problems, etc.).  And malaria is just one of many serious diseases in the developing world (tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, dengue fever, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, etc.).  If you acquire a severe disability before you're even old enough to enter the workforce, how does creating jobs help you?  Creating jobs alone is insufficient to address the problems of Africa.  You have to concomitantly address the heavy burden of disease if you are to have any chance of solving the economic woes of Africa.",1287190919

Certainly Microsoft won the race, but it's not like every other player on the scene at the time wasn't trying to do the same thing.<p>Every single PC maker/OS developer knew that winning the bulk of the market was the key to success.  Thus, they were all following similar strategies.  I just think it's unlikely, if there was no Gates, that we wouldn't have all ended up on the same platform anyway, and some other company would have had a monopoly.",1287190849
