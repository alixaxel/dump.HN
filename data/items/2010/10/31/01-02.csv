I've never been able to get a good high off of a bong or pipe, but mix it with tobacco and I'm set. The interesting thing is that tobacco has no effect on me at all, I've smoked cigarettes and nothing, I often smoke a cigarillo when I'm social drinking with friends who do smoke but my body doesn't seem to get a response.<p>My parents both never smoked, my paternal grand parents didn't smoke (AFAIK) and my maternal grandfather liked the occasional pipe (literally occasional, I never even knew as a child). As far as investigation has gone in my family, <i>no one</i> smokes. Aunts, uncles, cousins, no one.<p>However virtually everyone in my wife's family smokes, my wife doesn't, but if she does have a social smoke I know she struggles with not continuing. The few members of her family who don't smoke have quit.<p>The bizarreness here is that my wife's family tried strongly to stop their children smoking, but my parents didn't try at all. They found out I'd bought a pack of cigarettes one time, but I didn't get them taken off me, I didn't get a lecture, I got nothing. They simply assumed they weren't for me, and they genuinely weren't, my friend asked me to pick them up for when we went out drinking.",1288490225

1852263,comment,1851526,1851884,0,0,jdietrich,,,"You want to know a dirty, filthy secret about the entertainment business? It's a business. Nobody wants to buy ""good"" scripts, because some abstract sense of quality doesn't pay anyone's bills. What the industry wants is commercial viability. They want safe bets, stuff that will be easy to market. They want sequels, spin-offs and derivative ideas that are familiar but <i>just novel enough</i> to be acceptable. That's what sells advertising, gets the viewers and puts money in the bank.<p>What writers don't understand (and what they'll rarely be told) is that paying your dues is largely a process of disillusionment. To put it kindly, the industry wants sensible, informed writers who understand how TV is made and know how to write scripts that are easy to shoot and suit the medium. To put it less kindly but more accurately, the industry wants cynical, desperate writers who will write whatever cheap nasty dreck pulls in the viewers.<p>Paying your dues is like a gang initiation, social proof that you're willing to crawl through Albini's trench of shit to get your script into production. Every menial chore that you perform, every late night you pull, every arse that you kiss entrenches you into the industry, further investing you in the payoff of getting commissioned. The longer you've been a dogsbody, the more confident a commissioning editor can be that you won't argue when they bring in a script doctor, when they ask for a few ""tweaks"", when they decide that a page one rewrite is in order. They know you won't argue over the casting or ask for too much money.<p>Entertainment is a shit business, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svCA3DJRgfI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svCA3DJRgfI</a>",1288489858

1852260,comment,1850894,1850894,0,0,sn,,,"Speaking from personal experience:<p>1. Seriously consider getting your own place or room. At minimum find somewhere you can go to be by yourself and not worried about being judged.<p>2. In the US (don't know about India) grades mostly only matter when you're first out of college.  For a bachelors I think good internships can partially make up for it.<p>3. Take fewer classes at a time and you will have more time to learn and succeed.<p>4. Maybe consider starting /  joining  a study group for your classes.  You get some socialization and there is a clear topic for discussion.<p>5. Along those lines also consider joining clubs for any interests you have. Again, already having a shared interest means you don't have to fish as much for something to talk about.<p>6.Failures fade as time goes on. My guess, though not knowing the culture, is that nobody is likely to bring up the F you had 10 years after you graduate.<p>7. Your life can change a lot after you graduate.  Moving somewhere completely new can give you a completely fresh start -- that's what I did.  Perhaps go as far as starting with all new possessions.<p>8. This is conjecture and something I am going to try myself, but break down big tasks into short tasks you can complete in a couple hours (perhaps answering 2 homework problems.)  Write down your successes in a book.  It will add up over time.<p>9. Given finite energy and time, I would spend more time on the classes for now.  The classes will go away before people do.<p>10. Lower risk relationships, such as people who you could simply never see again if something bad happens, may be easier to deal with.",1288489808

1852236,comment,1851526,1851526,0,0,chipsy,,,"A recurring problem with the creative media industries is that the path from initial concepts to audience awareness is quite lengthy and convoluted. Even great creative products tend to have a preferred niche, and rarely is the marketing information available to nail down niche audiences for a big launch day.<p>But these industries are still mostly focused around big launches, because they have to completely reorganize with smaller budgets to attack the long tail. Music, comics, and writing have all made some progress towards this reorganization since both their production and marginal costs in digital form are low, so there's a great opening for the non-pop genres. Games are a bit less so, and video probably the least. But what's slowing this process down the most right now is that a niche audience has to be built from scratch, on a per-creator basis.<p>So either you work within the system and hope for a big door-opening break, or you go completely indie and bootstrap your entire business model, customers, etc. from nothing - which effectively means that even if you are indie, you still need to find a bandwagon to jump onto, or you'll probably never get a critical mass of interest.<p>I suspect that there's a business in providing aggregation mechanisms for untapped genres; I've just started building something along these lines in the last few days :)",1288488948

The TV licence costs £145.50 (about $233) per year and gets you approximately 50 TV channels (some in HD!): <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_terrestrial_television_channels_(UK)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_digital_terrestrial_tel...</a> (all those listed as ""Free to view""). The BBC's output is typically high quality (BBC 4 being nearly entirely high brow documentaries) and is <i>commercial free</i>.<p>You're certainly welcome not to pay the licence fee and not watch TV, but spreading lies about how supposedly bad the British TV system is is disingenuous and perpetuates a silly North American myth similar to that about British food or teeth.<p>Now, I'm off to clean myself as I've just defended the licence fee, something I'm not entirely keen on myself ;-)",1288488086
1852213,comment,1851881,1851881,0,0,frederickcook,,,"Very good post, Martin.<p>My co-founder and I recently made a decision regarding a partnering with another company in a somewhat new field. We made our decision pretty quickly, and it wasn't until I was later asked why we made the decision we did that I went back and considered what had really led us down the path we took:<p>A mentor who works at a big hosting company talked about the way they go about choosing open source technology is not by looking at what the best technology at the time is, but at the quality of the community contributing to that technology, and make a bet that that one will ""get better faster"" than the others. Without thinking about it, that was the primary criteria that led us to make our decision: the company we chose isn't currently the best at what they do (which is why I had to give this some thought when queried about the decision), but they seem to have set up some systems that (we believe) will let them ""get better faster"" than their competitors.<p>It wasn't something we considered at the time of making the decision, but in hindsight, that anecdote was the ""vector"" that gave us the reasoning that probably contributed the most the decision, without us really being conscious of it.<p>Edit: Thinking more about this more now, these incredibly well-built-up and well-tested transfer functions that experienced entrepreneurs and investors have built up is what makes YC and other mentor programs so incredible. This is how Ron Conway and Jessica Livingson judge entrepreneurs so well from just a simple conversation.<p>It's nothing that can be taught, but through books like Founders at Work, or simply sitting and listening to an entrepreneur tell their story, and recall the tough decisions they made early on, one can probably build up pieces of this transfer function. It's what makes Mixergy interviews valuable: there's not a much traditional educational value to them, but just hearing the story of what decisions were made, when, and why, helps build these functions for the viewer.",1288488067

Perhaps even at a very high level, making very good money.<p>If, on the other hand, you're actually obsessed about creating something great, you end up inventing facebook. There's a good chance you'll fail, too but at least you have followed your dreams and imaginations.
