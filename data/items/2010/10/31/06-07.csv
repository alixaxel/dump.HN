1852696,comment,1851526,1852399,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think the main reason to ""contribute to OSS"" is to learn (and demonstrate!) new skills that you would not otherwise be able to learn on the job.  Businesses generally are not in the habit of paying people to do something for which there is no business need.  So unless you work at Google, you are very unlikely to have an opportunity to build a webserver.  Unless you work on the compiler team of a big company (almost all of which require prior experience with compilers), you are unlikely to have an opportunity to build a compiler or interpreter.  Unless you work for Google or Bing, you are unlikely to have an opportunity to build a search engine.<p>But if you contribute to Apache or Lighttpd, you're building a webserver.  If you contribute to Python or create your own open-source language, you're building a compiler/interpreter.  If you contribute to Lucene, you're building a search engine.<p>All of these teach you skills that can be very valuable if you start your own company.  If you can take your server count down from 27 to 1, that's money that goes straight to your bottom line.  If you can spend 3 hours writing a script that fixes a problem throughout your codebase instead of 3 months doing it manually, that's time that you can use to innovate instead.  If you can index the contents of the web efficiently, you'll know how to index lots of other things efficiently, and there's bound to be a startup idea in there somewhere.<p>I don't think ""writing some boring glue code for the frameworks our for-profit businesses use"" is all that much of a resume boost anyway.

I imagine the supply chain is also very commoditized, and Apple is the kind of company to take that process apart and refine it in the same way, to unlock value in the form of greater margins.<p>EDIT: Another area where their attention to detail is apparent is their manufacturing tolerances. They've pretty much perfected the art of physically manufacturing precision components. I've not been able to find another product, luxury or otherwise, that comes close to the fit and finish of Apple's devices - and thats including things like rolexes, ferraris, etc.",1288507271

1852670,comment,1852374,1852477,0,0,dalke,,,"1) mechanics, cleaning crew, and other people who have direct access to the planes do not need to go through security - it's only places visible to passengers where this is done. After all, airplanes are used to smuggle drugs, so the same process can be used to secrete a bomb.<p>2) additional security and screening costs money, time, and our patience, but there's no evidence that it's effective. A GAO report points out that the TSA expedited purchasing of the full-body scanners without doing anything to ensure it would be better than the existing system. It was done in part as a reaction to the attempted bombing of 25 Dec 2009, but without evidence that the machines would be effective against a repeat of that attack. I also recall a report (perhaps 5 years ago?) saying that penetration testing of post-9/11 security was as easy as pre-9/11 despite the attempts by the TSA at improving it.<p>3) Another GAO reports highlights that the TSA has done no evaluation of how to improve overall security. For example, a bomb set off in the waiting lines of densely packed airport security, or in Penn Station, would also have a chilling effect on our travel. This attack was done already against El Al's ticket booth in LA. Or consider the hijacking of CanJet Flight 918 where an armed gunman forced his way through security and got on board an airline preparing for takeoff - when the pilots are present but before the doors are secured. Full-body scanners do nothing against this attack.<p>4) As the GAO and others have reported, people can still smuggle things in their body. These are not detectable by the full-body scanners. With enough people in collusion, that is sufficient to get the parts for a bomb through security.<p>If it's impossible to keep drugs out of prison, with 24-hour observation and multiple levels of walls and barriers, it's not going to be possible to keep a bomb or weapon out of a plane. The goal is to reduce the likelihood, but there's no evidence that the full-body scanners make a real difference. Instead, they waste money, waste time, waste patience, and inure travelers to yet more intrusions on their personal life.<p>Therefore my annoyance comes from being told to do things which are meaningless and ineffective, and perhaps even detrimental to overall security.",1288507215

It is not necessarily a foregone conclusion, and I think that Google has avoided ""being evil"" in regards to ads in their search results, for the most part.<p>The really disingenuous part of this article is that Google does not own a monopoly on information, or information indexing. Nobody is ""allowing"" them to control information indexing; it's just good enough that there hasn't been a compelling need for an alternative. In fact, the author draws a parallel between public libraries and search engines - yeah, the government controlling our information indexes on the taxpayers' dime without any incentive to actually provide good results or to improve upon the system is <i>obviously</i> a better solution.<p>The author, or anyone here, or some kid in his parents' basement is more than free to create their own completely open, free, self-funded information indexer (see: DuckDuckGo!). The problem, of course, is that Google provides much better, more complete, more comprehensive, more useful results for the vast majority of information indexing, because of the ridiculous amount of money and talent they've invested into solving these problems. As nice as the idea is, the world doesn't run on nice thoughts and good intentions - at the end of the day, that brilliant engineer that figured out how to return your search results 0.03 sec faster has to feed his family.<p>Advertising in a search engine isn't inherently evil; it's <i>dangerous</i>, because advertisers will want to buy the first search results, and will often pay well for that privilege. The temptation of that offer is strong, but honestly? Google's big enough at this point that they've proved that they can be enormously profitable without having to sacrifice result quality. If anything, Google has made advertising more useful to me as a consumer, rather than allowing advertising to degrade my end-user experience. Google is successful because they've delivered consistently useful results, and then attached advertising to it, not because they've delivered advertised results and then the actually useful stuff 2/3's of a page later.<p>I eagerly await the author's new, open, free-to-use, ad-free, as-good-and-fast-as-Google search engine.
