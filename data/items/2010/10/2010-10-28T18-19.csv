1844329,comment,1840389,1841714,0,0,Dbug,,,"I'd suggest you do some reading, there's a serious hole in your knowledge of HP.  The HP history and culture that people admire has nothing to do with PCs or printers, and predates those going back many decades.  (Does anyone know of a museum or collector that might be interested in my HP 300A Harmonic Wave Analyzer?  I think that was their second product, a very impressive one for the early 40's... It's still useful)<p>HP has a long history of very sophisticated electronic test equipment.  A great deal of innovation and hard work went into development of that equipment, including many things that hadn't been done before.  Many other tech companies used HP (and Tektronix) gear when developing their products.  Aside from the many tech contributions, their corporate culture was certainly one to admire.  HP was better known to engineers than consumers, but they did do some things that crossed over.  The HP-35 hand-held scientific calculator was the first product of it's type I ever saw (and owned too...), certainly seeming worth the $400 one cost back in the day (around 1972).  HP was constantly pushing the state of the art.  HP wasn't merely successful, they were special.<p>I was sorry that the HP/Compaq computing combination got the HP name.  I wish that had stayed with the real tech products, but in Agilent tech lives on.  HP certainly stands out from an era when the U.S. really shined as an engineering and manufacturing leader.  HP wasn't another Dell or Gateway.<p>There are (and were) tech companies with a past that goes way back.  For instance most think of Motorola as a cell phone company.  They were huge in semiconductors (some of that lives on in Freescale), but how many remember them as being the ones behind the first car radio or first under $200 television set, or making communications gear that went to the moon?<p>In comparison, I find it a little sad to see highly valued companies like Facebook that don't really seem to produce anything.  If it had never come into being, would we have really missed much that mattered?",1288291819

Is there enough interest now to hire a few developers to build HTML 5/CSS 3/etc.-only experiences? Absolutely. Is this a tenable position for anything more than a minor fraction of the web development market? No.<p>Companies like making money (naturally). iOS provides a clear path for them: They build an app, it goes on the app store, out to millions of people, and the money comes in. That is undisputed - you can absolutely make a nice living targeting exclusively iOS devices (by extension, WebKit-only platforms).<p>However this is conflating the problem space of ""building mobile web applications"" with ""building mobile apps that use web tech"". Buiding web-tech mobile apps is, functionality-wise, a sub-set of building mobile web applications. Any functionality that you would need to build a mobile web app you would also need to build a mobile app (albeit you can skim far more off the file size and functionality by targeting just apps - as Zepto has done).<p>jQuery is targeted at supporting ""building web applications"" and ""building mobile web applications"" - the two harder problems in the space. When you compare Zepto (designed to make it easy to build mobile apps targeted at a single platform) to jQuery (designed to make it easy to build mobile web applications targeted at many platforms) the difference is night and day.<p>This is the disingenuous part of this discussion: Zepto is, apparently, exclusively positioning itself against jQuery - even though they are completely dissimilar.

SOP was to call in a tech to ""fix"" it, meanwhile Visa and MasterCard would ""stand in"" on our auths, at great expense and greatly increased fraud exposure.  After a few late-night emergencies I realized that the tech couldn't even do diagnostics without rebooting the Series/1. And he never found a problem after rebooting. That was at least an hour of stand-in time down the drain, mainly spent waiting for the tech to get in there at 2:00 AM.

It's closer to 20% in sunny places, and closer to 10% in places with less sun.<p>However, that still leaves us with a respectable amount of electricity. Good for them.<p>Of course, the panels themselves are not the whole cost. There's other electrical equipment needed to make that energy usable, for example, and someone has to install and maintain the solar panels. I think the next big source of money in this market, after they get the cost of manufacturing the panels down far enough, is streamlining installation and maintenance. Perhaps someone could make durable ""solar shingles"" that are relatively easy to put on a house, or some such thing.<p>Longer-term, solar photovoltaics look like they could provide a pretty hefty amount of energy cheaply, if we solve a lot of engineering issues. Where they fall down is producing power reliably, close to where it's needed. One way of dealing with this is to have the solar panels in space, but obviously that's pretty tricky. Another way of dealing with it is to use something else to provide the base load of your electrical grid -- nuclear could handle this with cheap green aplomb -- and use the solar power for things which can easily soak up cheap intermittent power, such as charging the batteries of electric or plug-in hybrid cars. Theoretically, it could also be used to power interesting energy-hungry chemical processes, like ammonia synthesis or aluminum refining.

Apart from the fact that having a baby unavoidably takes up more of a woman's time than a man's on a biological level (how is babby fed?), the general observation is that women psychologically <i>want</i> to spend more time with their children than men do.<p>Men and women are largely interchangeable, except around breeding time, where their brains and bodies become very different. Their brains much less so than their bodies, but there's still a lot of instinct built into the human psyche.<p>As a more general point, while you'll sometimes go wrong with generalizations of the form ""women like <i>A</i> while men like <i>B</i>"" you'll go wrong less often than you will with the belief that men and women are completely interchangeable on all levels.",1288288943

1844058,comment,1842554,1842554,0,0,jashkenas,,,"There are a couple of questions about Backbone towards the bottom of the article, and this seems like a fine place to answer them:<p>akshayr mentions that in the context of an event handler in a View, ""this"" is bound to the instance of the view -- which differs from jQuery, where ""this"" is bound to the element that the event originated from. This is by design: it's awfully nice if methods on a View maintain their notion of ""this"", regardless of if they're called directly, or triggered by a DOM event. If you want to know which element was clicked, that's what ""event.target"" is good for, where ""event"" is the object that jQuery passes as the first argument to all DOM events. Here's an example that makes use of both ""this"", and the specific element:<p><pre><code>    var NoteList = Backbone.View.extend({

      events: {
        ""click .note .title"": ""openNote""
      },

      openNote: function(e) {
        var el = $(e.target);
        var note = this.notes.get(el.attr('data-id'));
        note.open();
      }

      ...

    });
</code></pre>
The other issue raised is the lack of JSONP support in the default implementation of Backbone.sync. It would be great to make this a configurable option, without having to drop down into jQuery for simple fetches, as akshayr did. Hopefully this will be a part of the next release.",1288288893
