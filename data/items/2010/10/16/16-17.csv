That number (if valid) counts all the auto-refreshes (""X new tweets""), trend browsing, API access from apps like TweetDeck, etc etc. Google makes so much per search because people actually sit down and want to find out something.<p>Having an auto-refreshing search for your company name that generates hundreds of searches a day isn't going to ever bring a dime of revenue in for Twitter. To get realistic numbers you'd have to first find out how many real ""I want to find"" searches are happening and then see what they are searching for. If I'm typical, the search traffic won't be super lucrative.",1287248396

Take GOOG411 as an example -- it was a cheap way to mileage on voice recognition tools for Android.  Take Google Maps, Android, and GOOG411 all in isolation, and the company seems a bit nutty.  But, once it became clear that they were all part of a strategy for location-based advertising, everything began to make sense.<p>I look at GWT, the Native Client project, and Web Printing as a couple of similar data points.  Clearly, Google is positioned to come out ahead as the Windows desktop loses prominence.  So, what might we infer about Google's intentions given the historical cohesiveness of its technology strategies coupled with the existence of these projects?  The point of my post was not to argue the merits of GWT but to ask whether it is logical to presume Google's intent is to replace JavaScript as the sole means of programatic expression on the client.",1287247781

Count on the fact people <i>will pay</i> for books and concentrate on <i>selling</i> them.<p>2) Every eBook DRM has been cracked.  But most who do that do so in order to be able to format shift.  Get an eBook at $9.99 from Kindle Store vs $$ more from Sony or Kobo, then strip DRM and use Calibre to reformat to ePub for a Sony Reader or Nook.<p>3) As others have already pointed out, there's B&N's nascent PubIt! service.  What that has going against it is that B&N uses a mutant form of the DRM that was common for ePub until B&N stuck its nose in.  B&N books are stuck on Nooks for the average person (similar to Kindle) who doesn't want to learn how to DRM strip.  You limit your market.<p>4) Kindle is THE monster.

1798214,comment,1791718,1797734,0,0,Dove,,,"Well, ontological arguments are ancient and always seem like cheating.  I am not a fan of them myself.  But as I understand things, Plantinga's contribution is to formulate the ancient argument more rigorously.  Even he does not claim the argument proves God exists -- only that it demonstrates God is either impossible or necessary.  (Nor do I claim to agree with him on that point.)  Particularly interestingly, the bit I presume you object to (though ""facepalm"" is admittedly a bit of an ambiguous criticism), that the possibility results in a necessity, is <i>not</i> the bit philosophers find objectionable.<p>If you wanted to really grapple with the argument as a means of growing your mind, not just satirize it without understanding what's going on, you should probably start with a more neutral summary of the state of things.  Like this one: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselms_argument#Plantinga.27s_modal_form"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselms_argument#Plantinga.27s_...</a><p>Honestly, though, that's not the one I would have picked to pursue. I think that particular contribution of his is a minor thing, only interesting to professional philosophers in the first place.  I had in mind something more major, like his notion of <i>Warrented Belief</i>.  Or perhaps something amusing, like his evolutionary argument against naturalism.<p>But look, taking someone's weakest work, saying ""Huh?"", and satirizing it may <i>feel</i> good, but it's not a valid way to grow intellectually.  Back when I was a creationist, if someone had said to me, ""Look, you really ought to read <i>The Demon-Haunted World</i> -- even if you don't agree, it'll expose you to a totally new way of thinking about things,"" and instead of reading it, I went and found someone on a creationist website who made fun of some obscure little passage without really understanding it?  I wouldn't gain anything by the experience.<p>Grapple with the original and the strongest form, or don't bother.  Don't fool yourself.<p>[Edit: If you're looking for something meaty of Plantinga's to read, try this: <a href=""http://philofreligion.homestead.com/files/alspaper.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philofreligion.homestead.com/files/alspaper.htm</a> .

Free online. Probably one of the best <i>computer science</i> books. It doesn't cover web programming, but if you know your programming fundamentals and theory well, you'll be in a good position to pick up whatever else comes along after current web programming techniques become unrecognizable. (The code is in Scheme, a Lisp dialect.) Do the exercises. Seriously - do the exercises. And yes, some of them are difficult.<p>PAIP - _Paradigms in Artificial Intelligence Programming - Case Studies in Common Lisp_ by Peter Norvig. This could very well have been three or four separate books. It has case studies of historical AI projects, chapters on learning / optimizing / implementing Lisp, chapters on search problems and logic programming, etc. Highly recommended, but I would wait on this one until you're proficient in at least two unrelated languages.<p>K&R - ""Kernighan & Ritchie"", aka. _The C Programming Language_. This is <i>the</i> book on learning C. Short, concise, informative. Your programming will benefit considerably by learning C (you'll be able to access low-level OS features, esp. on Unix, and it gives a good mental model for the lower-level stuff going on). If you like C and are comfortable with the exercises in K&R, then get _C Interfaces and Implementations_ by David Hanson - it covers practical library / API design, by way of a guided tour through several of the author's freely available libraries.<p>Also recommended:<p>_The Practice of Programming_ by Kernighan and Pike - Concise, practical advice about the programming skillset not specific to any one language: debugging techniques, how to write clean code, testing, rules of thumb for performance tuning, etc.<p>CTM, _Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming_ by Van Roy and Haridi (<a href=""http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/book.html</a>).

Advertising is everywhere. If you went to New York in 1900 it's be completely different to the New York of today, as would Paris, London, Shanghai, Buenos Aires, Istanbul and so on. The cultural differences would be so much greater than they are now, as would the dress, the traditions and so on (perhaps less so for the traditions). Then you start looking further afield, away from the cities. Places like Fuji, Rhodesia, India, the near east etc.<p>To experience those things would be somewhat incredible, perhaps moreso than the global, homogenous McDonalds/Starbucks in every town world we see today.<p>Then there's the experiences you could have. You could watch Sandra Bernhard perform. Go to see the Kitty Hawk's maiden flight. Go to Paris and meet people like Claude Debussy, or to Holland and meet Vincent Van Gogh. Visit Sigmund Freud in Austria, watch the birth of Hollywood and meet people like Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Stan and Ollie.<p>As for things to see in 1900, you could travel to a still Victorian London and see Queen Victoria's visit. You could go to Australia for the first time (Australia was 'created' in July). You could see the opening of the Paris Metro, and while sipping a bol du Café read about the Boxer rebellion in China. Or you could meet Mark Twain as he comes off the docks back to the U.S. then go to the first Automobile show in Madison Square Garden.
