I tried a local resource first, and then I went to Craigslist, which has worked out well for me in the past.<p>My ad was simple and direct; it spelled out what we were about, what we were looking for, and what we could offer, and then it had instructions: if someone wanted the job, they needed to solve an easy puzzle, <i>not</i> send a resume, and instead send about a paragraph talking about their skills and experience.<p>It worked out great.<p>As far as I'm concerned, resumes are next-to-worthless. I don't really care who you've worked for or what you've done for them. I'm not going to call them and see if they say good things about you. I just want to know if you can figure things out and communicate well. During the interview, I'll sort out whether or not you actually know what you're doing.",1286074691

1751961,comment,1751838,1751838,0,0,DevX101,,,"I think the broader point is that entrepreneurs should expose themselves to as many domains outside their comfort zones as possible.  As hackers/entrepreneurs we're generally pretty good at seeing a solution to a problem.  The issue is, that we don't see enough problems, because many of us are confined to a relatively narrow experiences many of which are echo chambers for what we're already interested in/agree with.<p>Why do you think there are SO MANY productivity apps? Because it's something programmers often need to work with to get shit done.  Same for coding tools, etc etc...<p>Another example: just yesterday someone posted the report recommending an income tax receipt.  Within 24 hours, there was a pretty neat app out for that.  The issue wasn't that someone couldn't do it -- but that the 'need' wasn't previously well defined to people capable of solving that problem.<p>So get your ass out there.  Find out problems and interests people unlike you have.  Maybe you'll stumble upon your next big thing.",1286074618

The first one could act as the 'master', and proxy all the requests.<p>It's obvious the limiting is rate based, otherwise this would never have happened, so if it is rate based then the toolbar could pace itself to below that rate. Of course that would 'give away' the rate to observers of the toolbar during a browser restart but they could observe that just the same by checking when they get blocked, so that's no loss.<p>The toolbar knows I'm logged in, knows that a browser has just restarted and presumably can see how many instances/tabs are open (after all that's what it provides the info on) so it has all the data at it's disposal to make the right decision. This seems like a simple oversight to me (that a user installing the toolbar on a machine with a large number of tabs open would land in this situation).",1286074482

Our ""big project"" is a weekly funtime/dinner where we pick up kids from the Section 8 housing complexes and take them to the center. We get food donations from Panera Bread (great organization) to send home with them. We also have video games and some non high tech games so they can just be kids. A lot of the kids don't get to be kids in their situation. We'll sometimes have kids come to us and say things like ""my dad told me to come to this so I could have a big hot dinner."" I hope to never have to tell my son or daughter that, then send them out on a bus/van with a stranger.<p>It really puts things into perspective.

1751954,comment,1751719,1751949,0,0,po,,,"Bots can probably perfectly duplicate the behavior of a toolbar. Only the rate and volume of requests would be different.<p>I'm assuming the toolbars can't communicate between each other. On toolbar launch, it should pick a random number between 1 and x and wait that many ms before contacting google. Pick x by looking at the number of req/sec that trigger a ban and the high-end number of tabs a power user might restart with. This would spread the requests out over that time period and keep it under the ban.",1286074241

If it's a magazine, a social situation or a TV commercial, they might collide with the abstract thoughts floating around in your head at just the right angle, producing a great idea.<p>People talk a lot about swimming around in your thoughts to conceive ideas. This is something that I definitely support; people spend way too little time letting their mind wander, and so they end up only being able to think in the shower or in line at Starbucks. Setting aside more time to do this, along with refusing to whip out the smartphone to read HN or check in with foursquare every time something isn't immediately demanding your attention, will give your mind a better chance to conceive new ideas and consider old ones.<p>That said, often it takes a little fuel to jump start your thought process. Something specific to consider, to trigger memories and begin a train of thought.

While I can get extremely upset at how difficult things can be in Fedora, like python and ruby, I generally try and take care of these things myself anyway. And who's not using RVM so why does it matter in the first place?<p>Truth is, I spend way too much time hacking at my Fedora system to make things work. It gets frustrating. I fall back to the Ubuntu systems and somehow, it's just easier. I'd comment on the details here, but it is madness.<p>So why even bother with Fedora at all? People. I can't stand Ubuntu people. From uneducated bloggers to Ubuntu fanbois, it drives me insane. You know there's a popular blog called OMG Ubuntu!? As far as uneducated views, there's a lot of talk about how awesome NetworkManager is in Ubuntu... you know where all that awesomeness came from? Fedora!<p>The Fedora community? Just amazing talented people all over the place. I can't stand to give them up. Some of the most awesome, unique, thoughtful and mindful people I've ever met all have Fedora in common.<p>In the end, I can't see how much feature X has to do with anything over it not existing in another distro. I can sort of see how something as shiny and new as a new Ubuntu release can be appealing, but not enough to move me. It all comes down to people, and Fedora has what really matters here.",1286071843

1751881,comment,1751245,1751536,0,0,JeffL,,,"I think this is true.  I recently read ""The Fates of Nations"" by Paul Colinvaux, which was very interesting.  One of his main points was that people are very smart about choosing how many kids to have, and they generally choose to have as many kids as they can afford.  For richer people, it tends to be less, since they want to give their kids all the best: the best schools, the best daycare, set them up with a good start in life, etc.  For poorer people, they don't spend as much on their kids.  They don't worry so much about education because it's often out of their reach, so they have more kids since it doesn't cost them as much.  (The book isn't so much about demographics as about how demographics have shaped history throughout time.)",1286071682

My biggest problem was that I'd put effort into selling and then I'd end up with more hours of work than I wanted;  then I'd pull back and I'd end up with not enough.<p>The advantage is that you can often charge higher hourly rates, and it doesn't require establishing yourself as difficult to replace at your current job.<p>You can pull it off, but there is a lot of sales and financial planning you need to do.  I've personally supported myself this way for almost a year, but it was pretty difficult.<p>2. talk your current employer into letting you do the same work, only two or three days a week.<p>(this usually involves losing your health insurance and most other benefits)<p>If you want to work 20 hours a week for the same employer steady-like (as opposed to scrounging for work all the time)  you will have to take the job full time and make yourself hard to replace, first;  then you explain the situation to the boss.  I've had pretty good luck doing this... better luck, in fact, than the aforementioned 'scrounging for several small contracts'  strategy.  I've probably done this for a total of two years of my career (while working on prgmr.com)  and they were relatively easy years (vs. my year doing #1, which was really difficult, and involved eating a lot of tuna.)    This strategy results in a steadier (and for me, larger) income, and because I'm really not that good at selling 'premium products'  it usually results in me earning more per hour, if you count sales effort.      Someone who is better at sales might have the opposite result, just 'cause part time catch as catch can gigs often can give you better hourly rates.",1286071546
