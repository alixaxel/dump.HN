It was Saturday afternoon, and while I was there to remove a nasty afro-mohawk that I grew out of boredom, the gentlemen crowding the shop where almost lifted out of the pages, and seem to be following fashions proscribed therein. They're not millionaires, they were your average Joes, but I could flip through pages and find everyone's fashion and accessories; from phones, to shoes, choice of clothes. There was even a guy who had his eye-brows done before he went on to sit underneath one of those ""insert head, wait for an hour"" bowls that look like a giant reading lamp, or a space helmet (my girl gets those and I never imagined apparently straight men would be into that. Does it blow air or does it vacuum?)<p>Maybe it takes an outsider to see a world differently, but to me it was a wake up call to keep an eye on that part of society.",1286077935

Google's duplicate content filter is generally accurate but in this case it penalized the site that originated the content and ranked yours higher because it assumed you were the owner of the content i.e. the page about sending free SMS's.<p>Google will quickly correct this error and you'll find the traffic on that page drops to nothing. You may also find other duplicate pages on your site penalized in the same way. You may also find your site penalized by Google for essentially screen scraping sites and copying their content verbatim and in it's entirety.<p>I'd recommend you set up a robots.txt to block Google from indexing identical pages on your site. Copying content verbatim and republishing in it's entirety is not a good SEO strategy unless you have thousands of throw-away domains and wear a black hat.<p>Sorry about the negative message, I'm sure this was very exciting for you guys but I don't think it's sustainable.<p>Perhaps an alternative is to have your users highlight the paragraph or snippet on each page they found interesting and archive that instead. Then publish those snippets on your site. Generally I've found republishing paragraph size chunks of text is OK with Google and will net you decent SEO traffic. It worked for my job search engine when we republished job descriptions and limited them to the first 400 chars. You can also mash the paragraphs up into pages with multiple chunks of text that e.g. show all chunks of text a particular user found interesting or a set of users or by date or location. That will give you the best of both worlds - lots of content to SEO and no dup content penalty.<p>Best of luck!!",1286077774

Clearly, we need to separate education and learning because they are wholly different pursuits (as any college grad or student can attest).  But, colleges make an awesome business model because they’re like the United States Treasury – they print money.<p>Myth 1:  All college graduates earn more.<p>In reality, earning a bachelor’s degree does not guarantee you a salary greater than the guy working next to you at Home Depot, H&R Block, or whatever random job you can think of.  It’s a fact that the single greatest guarantor of earning power is nepotism.  A referral by the “right guy” will always trump whatever printout you’ve gotten from your most recent collegiate printing press.<p>Myth 2:  A college degree pays for itself.<p>This is surprisingly – true.  A college degree pays for itself because you’re probably stuck working a job that you hate to pay off debt from the degree.  After you paying off the degree, you return to college and attempt to find a “job or pursuit that you love.”  (Sound familiar yet?)<p>Myth 3:  College is your first step into the real world.<p>College life is surreal.  You have limitless amounts of time to shit away and follow any pursuit that your student loans will permit.

I generally agree with a lot of what you're saying.<p>My potential audience is pretty targeted - mainly research scientists and possibly some government workers. They'll likely be more computer savvy than the average user (on average, at least - some scientists I know are just as bad as Grandma.) What I worry about in considering a web app is:<p>1 - People want to be able to run the software anywhere, any time, without a connection to the internet.<p>2 - When entering large amounts of data, which is potentially sensitive, into an application, it seems like people would trust a desktop app more.<p>Number 2 is subjective, but as a scientist myself, I would feel better about a program running on my own machine.<p>Any thoughts?",1286075488

Most of the advertising in these mags would fool you into thinking that the average reader of this magazine is a 20 year old with a million dollar paycheck only interested in pleasing his woman.<p>I'm not sure most readers of these mags can even relate to the luxury goods advertised. Anyways, how does that help my startup? From what I've read, most of the articles in the mags are highly stylized/fictionalized, I wouldn't trust them to validate a demand, I would much rather sit down 1 on 1 with a small number of people, rather than base that decision on these mags.

This however should not mean the less gifted ones among us give up without attempting.<p>Certainly. I wasn't questioning your <i>ability</i>, but your <i>interest</i>.<p>> Unfortunately where I come from lack of true research opportunities are far and few.<p>I must disagree. Any 8-year-old with a pencil and paper can do research in mathematics and the theory of algorithms. Give him a piece of glass, and he can get into optics. Send him outdoors and he can work on biology, chemistry, etc.<p>Of course, this won't be <i>groundbreaking</i> research. But the point is that people who <i>like</i> doing research are probably already doing it. They just need help getting to the front lines of a field, so that they can make significant, truly original contributions. That is part of what a PhD program is for.<p>I can't tell much about you from a couple of paragraphs--and you don't need to justify yourself to me, anyway. But some of what you said earlier raised a ""red flag"" in my mind. As a PhD student, you have, no doubt, been exposed to some of the important and/or difficult problems in your field. Have you tried solving any of them; if not, have you spent much time thinking about how you might go about solving them? More generally, do you <i>enjoy</i> problem solving? Do you work on problems when you are not obligated to? Do you talk about them with your friends (or <i>wish</i> you had friends that liked talking about them with you)?<p>If so, then, great, figure out how to overcome your current obstacle, finish your degree, and have a fun life being paid to do what you love.<p>But if not, then you might be investing a huge amount of time & effort preparing for a career that you'll hate.
