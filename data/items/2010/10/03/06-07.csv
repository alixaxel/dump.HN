People magazine gives middle aged women something to dream about, Maxim does the same thing for guys, reading signal vs. noise does the same for aspiring founders. Because the audience is actively seeking something, there's a good chance they will follow whatever they're being fed by the media outlet. Some of these audiences are less receptive than others, but I understand how it's helpful to understand that market.<p>Also, I think it blows air but not sure. :)",1286089169

Your situation and the people in your life (clients, partners, etc) are not going to be the same as everyone else so it's not going to be very relevant to your specific situation. Try transitioning rather than starting from scratch. Perhaps it's better that instead of working 2 to 3 days a week, you're working 6 months out of the year. Try going down to 4 days a week, then 3, then 2, etc. The less drastic the change the more receptive people will be to it. It's also going to be better for you as you'll adjust to the new work schedule and income over a longer period of time. You mentioned cutting expenses, just do that, you don't have to ask anyone, less expenses will make the transition easier and is never a bad idea.<p>You should be prepared with the concessions you're willing to make to make this happen and this will likely be asked when you float the idea.<p>Also, consider that you've moved up Maslow's hierarchy of needs and re-evaluate a lot of things in your life that may no longer be relevant. I'd bet you're transitioning from esteem to self-actualization.

You may not like it, but some people do.  That adds to Google's stickiness; those people are now much less likely to switch search engines.  If the $.12/query rate is to be believed, that stickiness is extremely valuable in the long run.  As for those that do no prefer Instant, I suspect they didn't have any trouble disabling it.<p>As a nice little bonus, Google gained notoriety for their Instant search.  This means anyone else who implements it in the future will be riding in Google's coattails, and will be much less likely to realize the positive effects that Google did.<p>If it were up to me, I'd have Google churning out more of these features.

Necessarily, he confronts related ideas like moral questions having no objectively right answer and science and religion being ""nonoverlapping magisteria"".
