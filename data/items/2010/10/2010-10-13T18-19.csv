1788381,comment,1787429,1787429,0,0,silverlight,,,"I'm a little confused about what the best-case/ideal scenario is for this.<p>As an example, I am currently working on a project that has a basic profile page. So on the server side, I have my nice OO representation of a Profile object, complete with properly defined public and private variables, a slew of functions, and a save() function that validates saves the data to the database.<p>When I display that page to the client, I have a PHP view which takes the data from the model and then renders it. In the view, I do currently use jQote2 to do some basic client-side templating where appropriate (for example, displaying all of the friends of the profile's user).<p>Now, the Profile page features the ability to edit profile fields. There is jQuery involved here. Currently, I just have a function that is called when the ""Save"" button is clicked that gathers up all the various data from my input fields and whatnot, and sends that off as JSON to be saved on the PHP side of things.<p>Is this someplace where Backbone.js would make sense? Would I then have to have a representation of my model both in PHP and in Javascript? And my PHP view would contain several Javascript sub-views? And when I do save the model on the Javascript side of things, am I then just executing database queries on the PHP side, or am I re-loading the model, changing the attributes, and then using the PHP model's save() function?<p>I guess I'm just confused as to where this fits into the grand scheme of things. There's a part of me that certainly likes the idea of data binding and having smart re-rendering of parts of my pages based on when models change, but I'm just unclear on how this fits into my existing PHP MVC stuff.",1286996281

1788375,comment,1787510,1787510,0,0,siglesias,,,"Just dropping some speculation here, as many are wondering what Lion can possibly offer that's new (and I don't mean a fix, but new).<p>Touch. Deep integration with touch. As you see with the release of the Magic Trackpad, Apple is retiring the traditional mouse paradigm and moving on to versatile and complex gestures to aid in window management. Four finger swipe for expose and show desktop has been godsend for productivity, as has three fingers up and down for switching between h/m files in xcode. Let's not forget swipe to go back and forth in browsers, pinch to zoom, rotation, etc... None of which is possible with the standard mouse.<p>And peruse through Apple's touch gesture patent library and you will see that they haven't implemented a fraction of what they have patents to. You have neat stuff like three finger pinch (possible to close/hide a window, save), non-adjacent finger scroll (ex. thumb and ring finger, note that Magic Trackpad is big enough for this one, but existing options on MBP are not), and several others involving rotation and unconventional finger combos. Expect for these gestures to be baked deeply into the new iMovie, iPhoto, and iTunes. Seriously, can you imagine alternate paradigms for simply grabbing video from a bin once you account for different numbers of fingers involved in the drag?<p>A preview of Lion with these features will allow them to sell the next generation MBP with a new, much larger trackpad to accommodate the new focus on touch and touch gestures. If Apple scores a hit with this new focus on touch, it will be another competitive headache for thin, underpowered clients that serve up web content and can't handle advanced video and photo editing, not to mention lack large surface areas for touch gesturing.<p>What's in it for Apple:<p>If you think about this from a competitive standpoint, most of Apple's competitors want to lift computing into the cloud--Google with Chrome OS, HP with WebOS, and even MSFT with Ballmer's pronouncements of ""cloud speed"". Apple's strategy, and profits, are vested in <i>adding weights</i> to computing to take advantage of powerful, local, GPU and CPU intensive tasks, thus slowing, or even reversing the shift towards browsers and web applications, in keeping us grounded in powerful, local machines. If Apple finally figures out a way to get your mom editing video with powerful and intuitive new touch gestures, how is a web application going to respond to this from the confines of a browser? How is Microsoft going to coordinate with clone makers to agree on standard sizes and performance of computationally complex multi-touch trackpads? Touch and media editing all the way.",1286996196

IANAL but am studying to that end, and being a Euro I was already interested in immigration law.<p>I would say the USCIS website itself is a good source of general information for the immigrant/family. After long being criticized as overly bureaucratic and unhelpful they've made a lot of 'customer service' type changes - for example, there's a tool to look up the status of petitions online which is quite new. The latest thing is provide more assistance to people being naturalized, eg via <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/citizenship"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/citizenship</a> which got a big makeover just in the last few weeks. Previously the would-be citizen's contact with the agency leading up to naturalization consisted of submitting forms, getting fingerprinted, and having to take the US civics quiz.<p>Anyhow, separating a couple during the interview typically only happens at a second interview when the USCIS officer (not agent) has specific reasons to doubt the veracity of the relationship - the couple hardly seems to know each other, or their filings are contradictory etc. If they have doubts after the first interview they usually issue a Request For Evidence inviting more documentation/clarification. Policy is to adhere to a neutral rather than skeptical stance by default, and proceed using an evidence-based methodology - challenging or accusing people at random is just going to result in complaints and slows everything down.<p>Merely applying doesn't put you under 'suspicion,' it's just a process of verification. The FBI does a fingerprint match and checks against the person's name in national and international law enforcement databases - this takes a while just because there's a lot of applications to work through. Most people are legit of course, so then it's just a process of going through the form evaluating the credibility and general stability of the applicant, verifying the authenticity of their marriage certificate/professional qualifications, medical reports etc. etc.<p>Now when they do suspect fraud, sure they might lie to see if they can catch a person out - as is true of any police interview. But it's not the default position. ICE agents (who go out looking for workplace violations etc.) are a different kettle of fish. There was a fuss at the end of last year about agents Utah in dressing up as Mormon missionaries.",1286995930

1788244,comment,1788160,1788160,0,0,grellas,,,"This case, initially filed in state court, had been removed to federal court on the ground that the federal court had so-called ""diversity jurisdiction.""<p>Basically, federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and, unless a case presents a cognizable federal claim or unless some other limited ground for federal jurisdiction exists (such as diversity of citizenship among the parties), the federal court will lack jurisdiction and the case must be remanded for processing and eventual trial in the state court from which it originated.<p>For diversity jurisdiction to exist, there must be complete diversity of citizenship among the parties, meaning that all defendants must be citizens of some state other than that of the local jurisdiction (here, New York). Facebook is a Delaware corporation with its principal operations in California and therefore is diverse from Mr. Ceglia, who is a New York resident. Mr. Zuckerberg argues that he is a resident of California, having lived here since 2004 to drive his company's growth. In his motion to get the case remanded to state court, Mr. Ceglia argues that Mr. Zuckerberg is in fact a New York resident and that this fact defeats federal diversity jurisdiction, necessitating that the federal court grant his motion to remand.<p>For a bit of editorializing, I would add (as one who has been highly skeptical of this case) that this strikes me as a rather desperate attempt by the plaintiff to get the case into a forum that might offer up more hope than would a federal court for getting jackpot justice. The argument on the technical point at issue is that Mr. Zuckerberg should be considered a resident of New York even though he has lived continuously in California for the last 5 years, has voted there, pays taxes there, etc. because he was held by a different court to be a New York resident in 2004 and because he allegedly ""lives out of a suitcase"" and has done nothing to establish a true residence elsewhere since that time. This sort of argument, in my mind, in on par with the rest of this case - essentially a wild swing that reflects an underlying position that is fundamentally unsound.<p>Time will tell as to the overall case but, as to this motion, I see it as basically frivolous. Whether the overall case is meritorious or not, it will almost certainly be fought out in the federal court and not in a state forum in which Mr. Ceglia evidently hopes that looser standards might apply.",1286994054

It has been rock solid for me for 2-3 years now.<p>The key thing is to make sure that all of the hardware in whatever laptop you buy has proper drivers. This can either be accomplished by buying a cheaper laptop with slightly less top of the line hardware (hardware that is slightly aged is more likely to have had someone debugging driver issues on it), or by checking that all of the hardware has appropriate drivers.<p><a href=""http://www.linux-drivers.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linux-drivers.org/</a> might be a good starting place.",1286993028

1788177,comment,1785547,1785889,0,0,geebee,,,"I agree, this writer seems is generalizing hostility to ""ivy league"" with hostility to ""elites"" in general.<p>It frustrates me that Americans still tend to view Harvard (or maybe Yale) as America's most elite university.  It is an extraordinary organization, of course, but it is (strangely?) MIA in engineering and many branches of applied science.  Consider the US News and World Report's list of ""most elite undergraduate colleges"":<p>Harvard
Princeton
Columbia
Stanford
University of Pennsylvania
California Institute of Technology
MIT
Dartmouth
Duke
University of Chicago<p>Now look at the top ten research institutions in Engineering overall..<p>MIT
Stanford
Berkeley
Georgia Tech
University of Illinois (Urbana)
Carnegie Mellon
CIT
University of Michigan
University of Texas (Austin) 
Cornell<p>So there's only one ivy here, and it isn't an especially high ranking ivy in the ivy pecking order.<p>I don't think people resent wealth at all in America.  People have huge admiration for Andy Grove, Sergey Brin, and Larry Page.  They have less love for Zuckerberg, but that's because they see him as a punk kid, not because they hate his product.  There's plenty of respect mixed in there too.<p>To me, if you want to say Americans hate people who went to elite institutions, I'd ask: which elite institutions?  The elite engineering schools, or the ivy leagues?  Ok, maybe some ""anti-intellectuals"" may brag that they didn't go to Yale (which <i>is</i> stupid, I'll admit).  But how many brag that they didn't go to University of Michigan, Illinois, or Texas?<p>I think it comes down to the notion that wealthy people are wealthy because they <i>created</i> wealth.  Once an elite is viewed as a parisitic aristocracy, the admiration drops off a cliff.  As it should...<p>... that said, I do think it's unfair to paint the Ivy League completely with this brush.  But it is telling that these venerable, elite institutions have been surpassed by such a different (and often publicly supported) group of universities.",1286992887

They're mostly done by people looking to get a paycheck, and without a paycheck the quantity drops. People aren't necessarily being pulled off open source to work on closed source, they're just being laid off (which seems supported by the unemployment stats.)",1286992865
