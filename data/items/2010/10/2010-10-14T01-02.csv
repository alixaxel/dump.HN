Use that money to reinvest into your product, make it something people want to blog about, or advertise.<p>Here's what I'd do<p>1. Create a product that is brilliant to use, and something that professionals on Flickr, or other stock photography sites use. I know this is obvious, but it's crucial to the plan I'm laying out.<p>2. Contact professional photographers, or photographers with large social media followings. See if they use any existing services similar to yours, see why they use them, work with them to get them users of yours.<p>3. If they're currently not using any, or if their using one and you've successfully integrated what makes them use it, proceed!<p>4. Partner with them! Partnerships = way better than spending money on advertising, in my opinion! Offer them 100% profits for x months, or waiver fees, that sorta stuff. Feature them, make them feel special. In return, they should promote their photos to their fan base, blog, twitter, facebook, whatever.<p>I'd also do what SHOwnsYou said, and pitch to all local businesses, and photographers. But most of all, I'd find blogs and sites with the your TARGET AUDIENCE and get them to do the advertising for you. This could be a giveaway (which is basically free advertising / awareness), or convince them to post about you because it benefits their readers.",1287021521

What are the benefits of doing this?<p>I tried just putting the all_experiments_json property in Firebug without wrapping it in quotes and I get a 'SyntaxError: invalid label' error. Looks like that is because the keys of the dicts are strings. Probably a way to generate this JSON server-side that makes Javascript happy.<p>One potential downside of making it just straight JSON is that this is generated by our Python template and if for whatever reason this isn't valid JSON it would throw a javascript exception when the file is loaded.<p>Right now our backend that generates this JSON does this:<p><pre><code>    dump = simplejson.dumps(experiments_dict)
    dump = dump.replace(""\\", ""\\\\")
    dump = dump.replace(""'"", ""\\'"")

Maybe their old one just died, maybe they are about to go away for work, whatever.  Some people just want things right away.<p>Spend some time around a car dealership and you'll find buyer behaviour that seems very unrational to a careful person, but then the spread of car buyer is pretty much the spread of the population.  As such, dealers need a certain amount of inventory to keep the showroom full and satisfy buyer demands.<p>Finally, you'd be surprised how many people can be upsold on expensive features (sunroof, leather, alloy wheels) with high margins because the car they are intending to buy is sitting right there, on the floor, ready to go, with just a teensy-weensy few more features on it.  You wouldn't get upsold at McDonalds if you had to wait for the bigger fries, the same at dealers.  Having the up-sell sitting right there, in front of the buyer, sometimes works with getting them to buy more.<p>The flip side of this is that certain franchised dealers are forced to carry inventory by the manufacturer.  The manufacturer helps out with the inventory costs by giving better finance on the inventory, but as a flip side they basically force-feed the dealer with stock.  It's up to the dealer to move that stock.  I guess from the manufacturers point of view, it gives them a certain level of predictability with their month-to-month sales and keeps the dealers working hard to move cars.",1287020713

However, since their project is Ruby on Rails + MongoDB, and Appleseed is LAMP, beyond the protocol, there's not much collaboration on codebases that can happen.<p>As for why to donate to Appleseed over Diaspora:<p>1.  Appleseed is a much more mature codebase.  We've been in development for a while now, and already have around 80 nodes in the wild.<p>2.  Appleseed has a much more experienced developer at the helm.  I've been programming web apps professionally since 1997.<p>3. We have a much clearer roadmap and protocol specification compared to Diaspora, which has yet to hammer out most any specifics in that arena.<p>4. Appleseed is much easier to install (about 5 min for anyone who's installed LAMP software before).<p>5. Appleseed is more ambitious.

(I'm zoomed in now as I type this).<p>I'm saddend (and a little angry) at the number of developers here who absolutely insist it's so much extra work to build a site that doesn't require JavaScript. If you follow best practices, it's not a big deal. Web apps create, retrieve, update, and delete records. No matter how fancy your new startup's idea is, you have to realize that it's all the same task over and over again, and you can do that with simple web forms that don't require AJAX. A little unobtrusive JS to capture clicks, hide boring interfaces, and transform your dull non-JS interface can go a LONG way. Plus you can test that the underlying functionality of your site works <i>very</i> early.<p>I'm required by law (Section 508) to build accessible web sites at my day job. It's much easier to make Section 508 compliant websites without JS. Then we put the icing on the cake to satisfy the other 98% of our users.",1287019842
