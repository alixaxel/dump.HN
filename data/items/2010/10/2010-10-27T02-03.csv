1837042,comment,1832243,1834326,0,0,bloomshed,,,"Forgive me for my bull-in-the-china-shop approach.  I get wound up sometimes because I lack experience and expertise.  I'm trying to communicate my passion and willingness to work with whoever is willing to make my vision happen.  Sometimes I get heavy handed.  Can't say it won't happen again.  Let's begin:<p>What’s my vision and why am I here annoying people on HN?<p>I have an idea for a mainstream social network in the vein of Twitter and/or Facebook, my vision is clear and the market for what I want to do is currently open.  I feel like I have to act quickly, and YC would be a great fit for me.  I'm pushing hard to let the selection committee know what I'm about.<p>What is my experience that shapes my attitude toward creating great things?<p>Everything I’ve read or seen tells me that there is no place for doubt in the foundations of an attempt of something.  Mother Theresa didn’t doubt that she was supposed to go to Calcutta for the first few years as she established herself there.  Her doubts came later in life but she had accomplished amazing things through her refusal to allow fear to prevent her from being successful.  I’m sure there are lots of different ways to accomplish things, I guess I was just thinking in general terms and I was trying to express most accurately how I felt.<p>What do I bring to the table besides the vision?<p>I have a passion, a willingness to listen, and an open perspective.  I also think I'm smart, good looking, funny, and I smell good, if that helps at all.  Examples of my so called passion:  I started a company, raised a small amount of money from my family, designed wireframes and product specs, and contracted with freelance developers to build a demo of the site.  My first demo should be done by the end of this week, according to my developer.<p>In my experience, why is saying all of that hyperbolic crap a good idea?<p>My use of “meaningless platitudes and danger signs” sounded good to me because I see, hear, and read a lot of that type of stuff from tech guys.  Take Ron Conway and Mark Zuckerberg at the YC Startup School for example.  If somebody came up to you and said,
""I'm working on something that hasn't been done before,""
you would say, 
""Thanks so much for that useless information."" 
Then if that person turns out to be Zuckerberg, you'd say, as Conway did, 
""I remember when Zuckerberg said to me, 'We're going to build something that hasn't been done before.' He had such a clear vision of what he was going to do.""<p>These ideas I have and my statements on what I bring to the table are completely and hilariously true.  I can't put them any other way.  It sounds dumb to say ""I'm going to build the next Twitter,"" so I try to avoid doing it. The only problem is, I believe I can so I have a hard time containing myself when I get started discussing it.<p>I try to bring a healthy perspective to my ambitions but it's hard to convince people that I'm serious because everyone I’ve met in the tech community seems to have an attitude of skepticism.  So when I say things like,<p>""I've got something big here.  I need a lot of help to make it work will you help me?,""<p>instead of people responding with,<p>""Tell me more about what your idea is,""<p>I get a lot of,<p>""It’s too big.  Do you really think you can pull this off?""<p>My response to that question is:  
“I know it’s big, I know it’s a long-shot, but it’s so cheap to try and the result could be amazing.”<p>At that point the skeptic says or thinks:  “A lot of stuff could be amazing.  Who cares?”<p>The optimist says:  “Thumbs up!  Let’s do this!”<p>For me, the issue should be about the product, not about who I am or what my skills and experiences are.  It’s convenient of me to feel this way because on paper I am completely unqualified to make this happen.  That’s why my constant refrain is, “Who wants to help make it real?”  It’s going to take a village.<p>I'm hungry to bring people into the project who share a passion for my vision.  I'm on my own right now and that's not good from YC’s (or my own) perspective.  It's hard to find cofounders in Milwaukee.  Maybe I haven’t tried enough to meet people, but the Winter Session is here, so I have to work with what I’ve got.  I've had help from a lot of people but too many of them are tied up with other things.  I can't make this project happen on my own.  YC would accelerate the process of helping me find the right people to make it real.<p>All of this stuff sounds like a lot of hot air until it happens.  I'm trying to get YC to help me make it happen.",1288147818

There's very little to suggest that it's a GNU package, although calling it a ""Linux"" command is still technically inaccurate, I suppose, even if everyone knows what you mean.

1837027,comment,1836053,1836914,0,0,jbooth,,,"When you lived in NH, the state was redistributing some of that property tax to poorer municipalities due to a NH state supreme court case that happened around 10-20 years ago.  And, like I said, if you weren't making a lot of money you were probably getting a bum rap compared to income tax as far as how much you had to pay relative to the total tax take.  Property taxes are regressive unless you have a sweetheart landlord.<p>I was talking about southern NH where the property values are high and everything else is comparable to Massachusetts - between northern MA and southern NH you're talking a 5-6k real estate tax bump for the average home.  In the boonies you pay less property tax because your town is getting it from Nashua.  They do have a lightweight state gov't, but it still costs money to run the various services in every town.  If you want to live somewhere very isolated and not pay for services you're not getting, though, northern NH is your place.<p>EDIT:  Ugh!  Clicked through to wikipedia.  What's the cite?  ""The Tax Foundation"".  It doesn't even mention property taxes, just state taxes, and no indication as to how they produced the number.  Their PDF is 1 page.

It's pretty easy to grow (climate allowing) and you can buy a 6 pack punnet of seedlings for a few dollars. Each seedling will supply probably 20-30 usable leaves over it's lifetime. The more you pick the more you get. It just needs some decent soil and a bit of water. If you let older plants go to flower and seed, chances are it will sprout again in large numbers without explictly replanting the seeds.  Nothing is crisper than lettuce leaves plucked straight from the plant.  Soggy lettuce in the fridge is not fun.",1288146095

On the Nexus, I went off-line (airplane mode), edited, and then went back on-line.  MAGIC! My edits showed up in my Chrome browser on the desktop.<p>My use case is that I want to use Google Docs (or equivalent) to keep notes while on-line and off-line.  MotoDiary ain't quite there yet, but it has the hard part (IMHO), the on-line/off-line syncing.  What is rough is text size and fixed(?) edit box size on the Android.  Also (obviously), it is diary-oriented (single entry per day) rather than supporting multiple documents.<p>Google Docs are totally uneditable (?WTF!) on Android, never mind doing it off-line and syncing.<p>There are some Apps that work better, such as GDocs.  GDocs has been a mixed bag, it allows me to edit off-line and sync docs, but has been iffy in terms of success rate.  It definitely isn't as smooth as my brief experience with MotoDiary.",1288145773

They're roughly organised by priority, and roughly by project.<p>There are a few reasons why this system is awesome:<p>1. High priority tasks cannot be easily ""shifted down"" to put something else above them. This forces me to deal with oldest first.<p>2. The only way to make something even higher priority is to go further up the wall. There is a limit to how high I can reach, therefore I have to be REALLY sure about putting something high on the list.<p>3. I'm using cheap sticky notes. The glue lasts about 3 weeks before it falls off the wall. If I haven't done it in that time, it's not going to happen. It also obviously wasn't that important and deserves to be on the floor. Occasionally, I go and pick up the drop offs and double check if I really should've done anything with them.<p>4. It's tactile. When something is done, there is nothing more rewarding that taking down the note, screwing it up and throwing it in the bin. TAKE THAT TASK!!!",1288145545
