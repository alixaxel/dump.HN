We want other companies to use our mapping platform, which uses route-me. When you get introduced to someone as a ""route-me expert,"" it makes closing the deal about 1000X easier. Companies like Red Hat and CloudMade were built on that principle.<p>I also think the death of open source is greatly exaggerated. It's natural that contributions would fall off, as FOSS gets more mature, and just requires polish. As it turns out, it's not nearly as fun to polish software as it is to write something new. And there's endless polishing work on all software.<p>This may be the single reason why open source isn't more dominant - because you actually have to pay guys to do the dirty work at the end, or they'll go back to hacking something more fun.",1287017994

The drawback is that the video card is past the bleeding edge that is gracefully handled by the stock fglrx drivers from ATI.<p>I spent days first fixing this in ubuntu 10.04 by manually patching kernel driver files and rebuilding the fglrx modules myself, followed by this being broken a month later when upstream went ahead and fixed the same problem in a different way, resulting in extensive maintenance to push out the conflicting fglrx mods. That said, this issue should actually be fixed as of the present 10.04 release and the double dose of pain I got may have been an artefact of my specific case. If this is really the case this is an <i>awesome</i> development rig. The only other drawback is that old ath9k chestnut, same fix as required for the other two mentioned model, the preempt line of kernels fixes this.<p>The only other issue affecting all three systems is that the touchpad freeze function does not work without extensive kernel level messing around and I couldn't be bothered to go that far to fix what I felt to be a minor issue (it was most pronounced on the ul80vt due to the size relative to my enormous hands and least on the G73jh for the same reason).",1287016363

Suppose a scientist writes a big piece of code to some complicated calculations, but makes a subtle mistake somewhere in it (perhaps some parentheses are nested incorrectly).  If the code is not published and another scientist comes along to extend the results from the first paper, the first thing he will do is try to replicate the results of the original.  If the code is unpublished, the second scientist will have to write the code from scratch, and in doing so will likely catch the original error.  But if the code is published, the second scientist will just use the original code and probably won't catch the error.  Consequently, the mistake will take much longer to catch, if it's ever caught at all.<p>The advantages still outweigh the disadvantages, but it's important to remember that there are always trade-offs.",1287014967

I can't, I'm working on a startup and even though it's a no-brainer, we are launching and it's too late for me.<p>These guys play pool, they don't live in the startup world.

These guys are willing to fly out and meet with you to talk it over. In fact, I think they'll insist.
