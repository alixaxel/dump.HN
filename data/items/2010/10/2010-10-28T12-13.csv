Really great for nocturnal people like me too--I think there was only once during the two weeks that I was hanging out at Metalab that someone said ""Oh, hey, you're going to have to go now 'cos the last person with a key is leaving"".

I'm developer and have a web that works with last.fm and youtube api, and works similar that yours.
Perhaps the problem is that you are using crhomless player and fullscreen, I had this problem at my site and i have modify the web because youtube blocked my web. Now is ok.
I think that the problem is the player, crhomless has no ads... and this don't like to youtube.

I think it deserves to be encouraged because, well... its more like the world I think most of us would want to live in.<p>I was thinking about how this trend would play out though, and being a cynic, I am certain that at some point this will be abused. 
All systems can be bent, broken, or subverted and for a human system like the HN community, the inevitable abuse  will damage the trust being built up on the site. 
I hate to be negative, but I have to point out that there are people who do NOT subscribe to the DNA of HN and assume that some other human beings are just marks. Offer HN is an ideal target for such individuals.<p>At the same time, for a successful community, Good faith needs to be assumed. The alternative is, well, suspicion of most offers, which I think would be corrosive to HN.<p>From here, it suggests to me that a separate system to ensure transparency and good faith would be required to support Offer HN requests. A simple way to identify affiliations, skill level and so on would perhaps be useful, and would also help address any further concerns that people may have. 
At the same time it could take away from the spontaneous nature of the help which would be a shame.<p>- Ok, complex rambling thoughts over! Hopefully someone finds something in this useful, it would be a shame to see Offer HN dissipate.
