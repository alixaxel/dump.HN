There is wide agreement that the patent system, especially software patents and business method patents, is in need of reform.  Rather than just venting your anger and frustration, you might make constructive suggestions. Do you believe in the patent system at all?  Do you believe that some software can be patented?  How do you distinguish that software from other software?  You claim all sorts of dire things will happen because of current practice.  Why do you believe that ""there will be no innovation in 10 years"" because of current patent practice?  Why 10 years? Why not 5 years or 13 years?  If things are going to be improved we need to have a clear and rational proposal for reform.",1287813570

Funnily enough, money also moves between accounts at the same bank.<p>My bank transfers to other banks take a couple of hours, but I don't live in the US. The money comes out of the account instantly though.<p>I think it's a bit of a stretch to say that a bank doesn't need transactions.<p>As for credit cards, that's great, but that doesn't address what he said, which is that it's an analog experience, which it isn't. Also, it depends on the bank, but there's generally an available balance and a credit limit. Credit card payments come out of the available balance instantly. I'm pretty sure that's running in a transaction. :)<p>What happens between then and actual acquisition is irrelevant.<p>Anyway, the point isn't the technical details, or how implementations differ.

The problem is one of balancing the risk and reward. The acceptable ratio varies from person to person, as well as the estimates for each. Collateral damage, for instance, is inevitable in war, and while such damage is clearly wrong, it isn't necessarily unethical. So saying that there is absolutely no justification to engage in unethical behavior is either trivially true, or false.<p>I happen to agree with your (I presume) belief that the suppressing the secrets in this case will have a higher cost than revealing them, but there is a reasonable argument to the contrary.",1287812984

1822751,comment,1822092,1822249,0,0,neilk,,,"<p><pre><code>   ""relatively recently""
</code></pre>
PHP 5.3 came out in June 2009. Quoting from the readme:<p><pre><code>   The key features of PHP 5.3.0 include:
 
    * Support for namespaces
    * Late Static Bindings
    * Lambda Functions and Closures
</code></pre>
I don't know what you are even arguing about.<p>PHP has a sort of support for types, but while you can say that a function accepts a certain kind of object, you can't  express that a particular function takes an int or a string. That's really pathetic. It's fine if you don't want a language with types -- many great languages don't have them -- but only PHP thinks that stupid half measures are acceptable.<p>PHP has had objects for some time, but it arguably didn't work well enough until their second try.<p>It's true that PHP makes it very easy to get at elements of the web request, but what I meant was that it is trapped in the content-generation phase. The Apache API is very sophisticated and gives you full control over the HTTP response cycle, but PHP throws all that way, and turns Apache into a dumb teletype. So every PHP script that needs to do authorization is written in this silly inside out way; first you start to deliver content, and then you check if you're allowed to actually do so. Whereas the right thing is to check authentication and authorization first, and then never even call your content script if the user's credentials didn't check out. Apache nicely separates this out with their Authentication, Authorization, and Content phases, but nobody told PHP. Other web frameworks don't have this problem either (I've used some web servlet engines written in Java, and they too avoid the brain-damage of doing it all in the content-generation phase.)<p>As for daemon scripts, I have no direct knowledge, but there aren't a lot of people who would suggest it's a <i>great</i> language for a daemon. Even fork() can be problematic in PHP. I wrote a system that tried to use it that way and we ran into all sorts of reliability problems (none of which I've ever encountered writing similar programs in Perl).<p>I may be more behind the times than others, since I happen to have worked on three different PHP projects that all started around 2003-4 or earlier (and are still chugging along). After being bitten in the ass by various broken features over the years, most of them have adopted a very limited subset of PHP (some even refuse to use objects, to this day), and I can see why.<p>I mean, PHP can be confused by something as simple as loading libraries from different script files. Rasmus' official advice to us was to have one ""loader"" script that included all the libraries in one shot. I find it hard to respect a language that has difficulties with things like this.",1287812318

The V symbol is alright, but the fonts are poorly chosen, the color and edges show compression, the edges of some of the type is blurry, etc. You might want to give your call to action buttons (Start free trial) a color that stands out, maybe a bit bigger. The idea is to make it clear to the user what their next step is. Also, why are there two call to action buttons, sign up and start free trial, when they basically mean the same thing? I'd maybe suggest having a big sign up button with ""30 day free trial"" in text below, or something to that effect.<p>The copy is a bit clumsy. Definitely have a native speaker with some linguistic savvy look it over.<p>In terms of getting clients though nothing mentioned above may be a factor. What is your conversion rate? Improving your site will improve on that, but if no one is coming to your site then marketing your site is a more important step to address.<p>Do you have any existing clients? How has their feedback been?<p>I'd recommend finding people for whom you've delivered well and investigating what worked well about that relationship. Maybe they can give you referrals, maybe you can target people in similar situations, and so on.",1287810432

For a backup application, this sort of thing is useful. Similarly, think of all the other whacky platform specific file things, that probably aren't in the Java view of the world (resource forks in OSX, alternative streams in NFS, device files, named pipes, sockets, etc).

Right now they may have the largest piece of this particular pie, but there is no particular reason to believe that as the pie grows they will maintain their market share or margins; we could all easily come up with a list of companies that could jump in and drive Amazon's margins or market share down in the cloud computing space.<p><i>Now, just think, if amazon decreases prices slower than their costs fall (which will fall approximately with moore's law) think how much work it is for netflix to move off of ec2.</i><p>It takes almost no work at all.  If some bean counter at Netflix tells their board next year that they the current cost/benefit ratio for EC2 now makes no sense it would take Netflix less than a month to move to another cloud provider and less than six months to move everything in-house again.<p>There is no switching cost and with more providers entering the space you are already seeing early arbitragers get into the game.  This is going to exert strong downward pricing pressure on all vendors in this space.  They are selling what is effectively a commodity, and there is no way they are going to maintain their margins for much longer.<p>If AWS and a bet on a future of fat profits from the cloud is what punters are using to justify this P/E they are making a costly mistake.",1287810188
