1822560,comment,1820294,1821776,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"> A middle class family paying a thousand dollars for one complete stranger to go to school is ridiculous sum of money, which is exactly why nobody pays that much money.<p>> However, the fact remains that middle class families do pay for part of the tuition of certain people (people who go to public school, and those who get federal loans). It is important to question why from time to time, so I will address your argument, and I will assume a number more realistic (<i>I don't know what a more realistic number would be, and I'm not going to do your work for you</i>).<p>So you clearly don't know what a realistic figure is, which means you obviously have no clue as to what an unrealistic figure is, yet you're highly critical of his ballpark analogy yet you can't even guesstimate to a figure within the city that the ballpark is in!<p>Perhaps you should ask <i>where</i> the original commenter is from. I grew up in the UK, the government paid for around 800GBP worth of education in night classes I took. I'm not even sure what the price tag on my 2-year certification course was but I'm sure it was a little more than a weekly Psychology and Sociology course.<p>As I've said before here, what pays my bills is using a hammer. At one point I was coding in HTML and PHP while I was 14 in high school, and I was pushed by every faculty member into going to university (I'm assuming to justify their own existence). I would have loved to go to university, I would have loved to have the opportunity to study psychology or ancient history, or some such... there's books for curiosity.<p>I use a hammer, and metal shears, and a drill. These are the basic of the basic, the most mundane objects in existence and I see dozens of intelligent, well educated people walk into a job and quit or get fired because they struggle to use them because of shitty education.<p>I have my woodwork and metalwork teachers to thank for a good education, one that anywhere in the world is guaranteed to pay my bills. Why is our education system set out to target self-actualization when it doesn't even teach us how to achieve our physiological needs.<p>First and foremost we should be teaching our children how to make money; how to work a job. Second, we should be teaching our children how to spend money; avoiding reliance on credit cards and debt traps. The aim is to improve peoples happiness, but without even teaching the basic steps on the hierarchy, it's a fruitless effort.<p>If more money out of my pocket would mean better education for the next generation, I'm happy to do it. I would actually love to see a generation of children told ""you know it's okay to want to do carpentry, or to become a mechanic"". If bashing the frivolity of higher education will get that, then I'll be happy to bash away to get a decent economy and a decent citizenry.",1287806057

If you don't do that, your ideas and creativity are nearly useless.<p>So it makes sense to make the button-mashing as optimal as possible, so that there is no friction involved in programming.  A few minutes of practicing new entry methods (using the right fingers for the right keys, etc.) eventually results in a less annoying interface between your brain and your computer.

Perhaps I am a slow learner, but it took me roughly 6-10 years of writing software, learning programming languages, studying CS fundamentals, learning about libraries, APIs, network protocols, character encodings, security and too many other things to enumerate until I really felt comfortable in my ability as a programmer. The first programs I ever wrote were awful; I looked at them again for the first time in years a while back and was shocked at how bad they were. Even after picking up a programming language or two and learning just enough other stuff to be dangerous, my code was still crap, albeit better crap. It wasn't until years later that I was regularly producing what I now consider to be ""good code.""<p>The spirit of this post is admirable, but rather than producing more successful startups it will likely only spur the unqualified but ambitious to create nasty spaghetti-coded PHP monstrosities with gaping security holes, which will only serve to make the public at large less trusting of web apps and startups in general.

Imagine what those with even less knowledge and skill are capable of doing.<p>In closing, the people here are either:
a) much smarter than I am and much faster learners;
b) trying to falsely give others the impression of (a);
c) too optimistic;

Right now the problem is that one can use it after 15 minutes of training and become expert in may be few hours of training, after which you can create super complex sites like twitter/HN.<p>I am doing a UX rewamp and trying to minimize the learning curve. The next version with some major UI modifications and support for all browsers should be out in 2 weeks. Do follow me on twitter or drop a line and I will make sure you know.",1287803047

It was more a ""look out, he has a gun - rush him"" kind of snow-job to get in there, with the idea that something could be found to justify that approach.<p>The bigger idea was a domino concept; that a remade Iraq would be a beacon of democracy in the Middle East, that all the other states would similarly switch over (one way or another) to democracy, Muslim fundamentalism would no longer be a threat, and the whole region would be a capitalist wonderland with oil. Sort of like 50s/60s communism in reverse. But it didn't quite work out.",1287803041

At the same time, advancements on the platform are not going to be taken advantage of. Any new features in OSX would go unused - because it's not in the lowest common denominator. As a Java dev, I have to say he has a good point there. I just wish Objective C didn't suck so much.",1287802988

Something I've always wanted but figured it was out of reach.<p>This post is great, too.  We should make this a regular feature because, how many frequent HN users end up launching a neat product like this and it languishes among blah-blah news links?  Tragic.<p>I've never even posted a launch on HN, but I love seeing them -- it seems like they should be highlighted on the new page or something.",1287802965

Kinda like Wufoo, except our forms aren't pretty.  But we do support setting up relationships between your datasets and we auto generate the views for you.  We also have a fairly robust security model that lets you restrict user/group access to datasets both vertically (filters records meeting criteria) and horizontally (restrict access to certain fields).  Plus what you're actually creating are Django apps, so (in theory) you can export them when you're done building them and host them on your own servers.<p>Go to /beta-signup/ to skip the mailing list and go right to creating a real account.",1287802916
