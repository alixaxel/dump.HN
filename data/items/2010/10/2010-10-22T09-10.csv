You can't compare Rails with PHP. You need to compare Ruby to PHP, and ask if the switching costs will outweigh any deficiencies; and you need to compare Rails to e.g. Cake or Symfony or similar, and ask if one language provides a framework whose advantages are so compelling that they too will outweigh those switching costs. I have yet to be convinced.<p>(weighting factors may apply for dev experience with one or the other, legacy code, hosting/infrastructure support, etc.)",1287741478

1819123,comment,1818954,1819020,0,0,derefr,,,"PHP is a programming language (that is, a formal grammar for specifying the operations a computer should perform), but also an implementation of an interpreter for that grammar. You're talking about the implementation, which is of fair quality (certainly better than, say, MRI Ruby) and very widely-deployed, a combination which many devs (brilliant or not) take advantage of.<p>People who say PHP is badly designed, however, aren't talking about the implementation; rather, they're strictly talking about the language itself—the syntax, the semantics, and the standard library. There is no advantage to the way PHP-the-language does things; it makes nonsensical choices (like the flat, disorganized, all-libraries-included function namespace, the inability to chain method calls in a single expression, the extreme amount of ""weakly-typed"" cruft surrounding the comparison operators, etc.) which derive no benefit.<p>It would be strictly beneficial to the programming ecosystem if PHP-the-language were treated as an object-code for other, better-designed languages to target, such that PHP-the-implementation could be used without needing to write <i>in PHP</i>.",1287741107

I have found (<a href=""http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fatfree.sourceforge.net/</a>) and I couldn't be happier. It's similar to Sinatra and has everything a small app needs. It's simple and make separation easier.

1819119,comment,1818954,1818954,0,0,pilif,,,"I'm maintaining a huge web application mostly written in PHP. We (well. back then it was just me) began doing this back in 2004.<p>Back in 2004, PHP was a very sensible solution: It was the language I knew best (we had little time for the project, so going with a language I knew felt sensible), it was easy to deploy and back then, there weren't that many alternatives anyways:<p>Ruby was in its infancy, for Python you had thread safety issues with mod_python or you went CGI, Java was and continues to be just ugly. JavaScript back then was still just a toy language. No Node.js or anything.<p>That would have left me with mod_perl, but looking at where we are today, that would have been an even worse decision it seems.<p>Fast forward 6 years.<p>The application consists of over 100'000 lines of PHP code alone now. It's in production use for many customers which serve tens of thousands of end users. It's not only a traditional web application, it also serves as an API for custom-made tablet pc applications (before we had the iPad), for GPRS-connected barcode scanners and last, but not least, for native Windows Clients (all developed by our company, using various languages).<p>While I really hate some aspects of PHP by now and I would love to have a Ruby or Python codebase to work with instead, rewriting all of this is out of the question.<p>Customers depend on this to work exactly the way it works now (they panic even if a link is two pixels off - welcome to the enterprise).<p>While I might be able to exchange some components with something else, I don't see the benefit it would provide - it would do nothing but make maintenance harder because I'd add another dependency to keep track of.<p>The only thing I could do is rewrite the thing. But by now, there's more than 30 man-years of work that went into this.<p>Sure. Redoing it wouldn't take the same amount of time, but considering it would have to look exactly the same (probably I couldn't even get customers to accept different URLs), where's the point in that?<p>OTOH, despite being done in PHP and tailored to sometimes crazy customer requirements, the code base is sufficiently clean to work with and it's constantly improving. Bad parts get factored out, good parts arrive, so it's not all-bad.<p>We are embracing new technologies as they become available and fit our product. Our CSS is now written in SASS, we moved from pure DOM scripting to Prototype to jQuery, we make use of the latest features of PHP (now Closures and anonymous functions from 5.3) and of our database (constantly running latest Postgres).<p>Even though it's PHP, it can still be fun.<p>Considering recruitment: Granted. It might be harder to convince a good programmer to work on this ""ugly"" PHP project. But a) we are not just doing PHP (just mainly), b) the code base is, as I said, quite clean and c) even though the code base might be in a language you don't like, the basic concepts of our profession still apply.<p>You can still discuss and solve interesting problems and you can still create great solutions to these problems.<p>If you don't want to take part in this adventure just because you don't like the language this is done in, then, frankly, you are not the person I want to hire.<p>Even though programming is the coolest thing you can do on this world, it's <i>still</i> a job and not everything can always be unicorns and rainbows. If you can't see this, then I don't need you.",1287740845

1819117,comment,1818954,1818954,0,0,hackoder,,,"What you need to understand (and most of us hackers too) is that there is a difference between the 'hacker' and 'get shit done' mentality.<p>Programming is something I've done for the last 10 or so years (in various forms). It is essentially the only activity (in terms of 'work' or career) that I enjoy. The engineer in me just enjoys making things 'perfect' (where perfect is a definition perhaps only I understand, but generally its something built on solid engineering principles. Well-tested, reliable, modular, efficient, etc). When code looks 'just right', I enjoy the code regardless of whether it is bringing me any $$$. In that sense, for me, engineering is a fun activity, and not 'work'.<p>The hacker in me will enjoy a well built piece of software for its engineering brilliance regardless of whether the software got anything done at all.<p>In the last year or so I've been able to isolate these personalities and perhaps merge them. I do not scold the hacker just because he wants to try out new languages every month and is opinionated about his favorite ones. I get pissed off when this stops him from getting shit done.<p>I'm glad for the hacker in me who cares deeply about the tools (languages, IDEs etc) that he uses. Its this hacker that makes my job 'fun'. It is this hacker that has helped improve the quality of my code and my thought process for building good software. The 'getting shit done' would never have been enjoyment enough if it were not for the hacker.",1287740838

Lots of interesting can be done in any Turing complete language. It would be just 'plus points' if you would use for example Scala for the kind of task you described. I just cannot see why to use a dynamic language in a task where performance is important when there is a statically typed fast language which is as good and as concise as Scala. It is not that it is impossible that I would join a company developing in PHP. We have to make compromises all the time.

Let me explain.<p>Several universities concentrated on Mach Kernel OS design patterns.  Thu,s when SJ left Apple he founded NEXT based upon extending this pattern with an OOP C language as the trade-offs with MACH in the OS do not benefit unless you adapt an OOP language to build the apps sitting on top that Mach Kernel OS and to be blunt C++ is a poor OOP computer language.<p>So when NEXT was acquired by Apple they had the opportunity to lower R&D costs as the initial R&D costs for this new way had already been paid by NEXT. Apple in its purchase of NEXT was just securing a price level of R&D for the next 20 years by buying the R&D team.<p>The assumption that Apple started with user experience is somewhat miss-guided and completely wrong.<p>To give you an idea of that initial R&D investment ..how many decades has GNU Hurd been limping along?

Also, all code generation has to go through the .NET JIT and the .NET runtime code generation APIs, which both aren't really optimized for the use by dynamic language runtimes.<p>However, Mono might be a better platform for dynamic languages, because the Mono team might be open to extending the core with some specialized infrastructure for dynamic languages...",1287739188

Ppl at my company say they do 'PR' and 'because it's good PR' but I'm not interested in PR, I'm interested in sales. Marketing leads to sales, it leads people to learn about your product and to want to buy that product; PR just leads to people liking your company, which is only a small factor in the buying decision, and only after they've already decided they want to buy. But, and here's the rub, being in 'marketing' is not cool, it's full of negative connotations, it's hard and full of elbow grease; PR is about writing lofty prose from your well-lit corner office before going on a 2-hour lunch with some journalist. So 'doing PR' is something people want to do, 'doing marketing' not. (which makes that those who want to do marketing, and are not afraid of it, can make huge hits).",1287738905

The most effective SEO practices these days involve off-page and off site linking and on-page optimization is gets slightly less and less effective every year. Tricks like keyword stuffing URLs, title attributing everything, and no-follow sculpting, which used to actually make a difference at one point in time, essentially make no difference these days. For most SEO aware web developers these days, SEO is more and more about accessibility and usability, as it should be.<p>The most effective tricks these days mostly involve passing as much link juice to the site as possible, and matching it to good content that is based on sound keyword research and user demand. In order to do this in such a way that actually makes a significant difference in ranking without being penalized is usually beyond the the average developer ""dabbling"" in SEO. The blackhat term for this is ""link laundering"" and it's really the only way to get the huge traffic gains in a reliable and sustained manner. Most SEO companies fit into one of the 3 following types:<p>1. Basic SEO is getting easier to execute with all the hand-holding that Google gives out to webmasters these days, however the benefits are minimal. Most of that realm is about making sure you're not screwing up your content, rather than optimizing it. The kinds of gains you get by doing this are maybe a 30% increase in traffic, assuming you site is not screwed up to begin with.<p>2. On the other hand, using link laundering/pyramids even less talented SEOs can see somewhere in the area of a 400% increase in traffic without much risk of a penalty. This is a lot trickier though because imitating a strong, natural, niche link graph is a lot harder than most people think.<p>3. The last strategy is commonly referred to as ""turn and burn"". This basically involves taking whatever content you have and link spamming the hell out of it which will cause it's traffic to spike briefly before being banned from Google's index. Ever seen all those spammy comments in you blogs that are pointing to a really crappy landing page? This is what they are doing.<p>Now granted I've made a lot of generalities here. Most of the time I see people discussing this topic they seem to not understand what SEO is compared to what it was 7 years ago which is why I'm taking the time here to explain this. The rules change a little when you start out with a valuable asset such as a large quantity of good content (such as any of the Q&A sites), or a set of very high quality links (anyone that's been covered by the major news outlets) because you can base your strategy on getting the most out of those assets.<p>Anyway, now that I've gone off on that tangent the easy answer is yes, good SEO is good for the web because it makes content more usable and accessible, and bad SEO is bad for the web because it means more spam.",1287738022
