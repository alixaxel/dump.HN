There are people working on stuff that's just sort of ticking along (there's a <i>lot</i> of technology in OS X, some of it sort of hidden -- like the latent semantic analysis framework, which is solely used for Parental Controls), or are inherently sort of gross (QuickTime for Windows, I'm looking at you), and I imagine that their experience would be different from e.g. the people working on iOS or hardware engineering on the Macbook Air or XCode.<p>I worked at the iTunes Store on video, and it was wild; I started about a year after the store launched, and there were maybe a dozen engineers on the team; by the time I left there had to have been a hundred (10x growth in five years.)  What was really motivating was watching the broadcasts of the keynotes -- or being invited to attend -- and seeing the stuff you'd been working on presented by Steve.  There was also, I have to admit, a certain charge that came from knowing stuff about future products that wasn't widely disseminated; Apple keeps their teams very segregated, and you often just know a code number or name of something that's passed over the transom, and you don't find out what it is until the rest of the world does.<p>But that said, siloing can have an adverse effect if you're not working on a hot product; once something is established, executive attention can wander onto something newer and cooler, and big company politics with all that that entails can come into play.<p>All taken with all, though, it was a fantastic place to work.

They train physically, high speed and safe driving techniques, weapons training, and of course they have to learn the vehicle code (it's a LOT bigger than you might think), and how to write reports.  Getting into the academy is fairly difficult, and many cadets washout before finishing.<p>There are so many laws about what police can and cannot do and how they have to do things, that it's actually quite complicated and has a steep learning curve.  They also work long hours (12 hour shifts).<p>I'm a bit biased since I have brothers in the CHP, but it's definitely a tough job.",1287462344
