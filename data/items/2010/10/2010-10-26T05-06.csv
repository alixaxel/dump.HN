But I think you're a bit wrong to dismiss document databases so quickly.<p>Firstly, the subtree update problem isn't a huge problem. MongoDB allows dot notation to update items within a document. Yes, it is may well have to do just as much work as a SQL database in the update case, but <i>I don't care</i>. I'd prefer it is implemented in the database than something I have to do myself.<p>Secondly, the schema-free nature of a document database is a killer-feature for me. I have truly schema-free tree data (different levels of the tree have different, unknowable-in-advance data stored against them). Yes, I can implement this in a SQL database schema, but it's going to be an ugly schema (eg, I'll have to use rows to store things that should be columns). It will also be slow because of the hierarchical walking needed in the queries. (Although Postgres helps some here with hierarchical query support).",1288072722

Take, for example, <a href=""https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36060/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/36060/</a>, a serious problem in the kernel that was recently discovered. Given the size of Linux, it would be highly inefficient to manually find and fix every instances of this issue.<p>Currently, Clang doesn't support the work-around option that GCC provides to prevent the aforementioned issue. I could just implement the GNU work-around, but with Clang, it's far easier to write a scanner which will identify every place in the Linux source code where those dangerous semantics appear.<p>Clang might not be mature enough to compile Linux for distribution. The difference between GCC and Clang is that Clang is not a compiler. Clang is a modular API that provides the tools to build C language front-ends to the LLVM compiler infrastructure. The Clang compiler driver is just one implementation of an application built using the Clang libraries.<p>Why would one want to do this?

Don't say things you wouldn't say in a face to face conversation.<p>It's common to bash people on the internet, but we tend not to like that here.  We do disagree here.  Recently there was a large thread on Ubercab and whether their service is so ethical and responsible.  Lots of people with lots of differing viewpoints were upvoted.  They raised issues (rather than just being blindly for or against someone).  It was enlightening to see the nuance and insight that lots of different people brought to the discussion and how complex the issue was.  You can disagree without attacking a person.<p>* When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. E.g. ""That is an idiotic thing to say; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3"" can be shortened to ""1 + 1 is 2, not 3.""<p>Comments that include things like ""OMG so much stupidity"" just make people feel attacked and defensive.  The statement doesn't add to the discussion and just makes things more combative.  It's as if you're trying to discourage people from disagreeing with you because you'll call them stupid if they do.  ""I think this is important to consider""; ""OMG, you're just so stupid"".  It isn't helpful.

Find out what the look for in a job, and if you none of your clients fit the bill, say so point blank, but that you'll get back to them when you find one that does.<p>- Build a tribe (in the Seth Godin sense of the word).  Build a group of people that look to you about finding jobs and hiring.  Organize events that get lots of smart technical people together, that isn't just a recruiting event.  Think about the 37 signals blog and the conferences they've organized.  Think Super Happy Dev House.<p>- Don't cold call.  Speaking personally, I'm much more likely to talk to you if you email me.  Aggressive phone calls are a major turn off.  If you must call, don't call before 10am in my time zone.<p>- Being open about the companies and positions you're trying to fill.  No caginess about what the company is, and being open about any potential downsides you know of.<p>- Don't recruit for companies you don't believe in.<p>- Know what you're talking about technically.

1833118,comment,1831838,1832163,0,0,mkramlich,,,"When you're starting with a blank slate of a project codebase, having to write and then keep evolving a SQL schema -- and do data migrations -- can be a real pain. With MongoDB, a collection (think table) has no schema, so each object (document, approx like a row or set of related rows) can have whatever format you want, can vary from object to object. While there is greater risk, esp in long run, of accumulating objects with structures that are unexpected or unsupported by dependent applications, in the short run it gives you a development speed boost. Also, the native document format is JSON, which, if you're doing web development, is more likely to be the web client-side data format you'd want to deal with anyway. Plus JSON is very close to a Python dict, which makes Pythonistas happy on the server-side. JSON is also a bit more of a ""self-documenting"" format compared to say what a SQL result dump looks like (every column/property has it's name/key declared in the dump itself). Also, if you have model data that's naturally document-like, with many sub-structures within it, hierarchically composed, then rather than having to slice it up across many distinct table schemas, each with an appropriate chain of foreign key references leading back to the mother table, you instead just stuff the entire model document, including all it's sub-structures, into a single slot in the Mongo database. So it simplifies that as well.<p>I recently evaluated a lot of different database systems too for a new project, and settled on MongoDB for a key part of it. While it has many positives (the above, plus performance and scalability) one of the negatives that worries me a little bit is the ""running with scissors"" feeling of not having database-enforced table schemas. Ultimately, we'll find out firsthand whether that leads to disaster or not, and whether it's a net win. My bet now is net win.",1288070257

I've given NV a lot of crap over the years, but I do think they have the most flexible and make-plain-able RSS readers out there.",1288069605

As far as I can tell, once you are over 100 and can downvote,  getting more carma does not alter your user experience.<p>I'd suggest you grow a thicker skin, especially if you want to say mean things on the internet.",1288069590

So I'll share something.<p>I was always a bit of a weird one growing up, especially in high school. I got picked on a bit by various groups, sometimes even by other picked-on kids that wanted to assert themselves. None of it was that severe and there were kids that had it worse. I had friends, and I got along with most people, but I was always a little bit of an outsider, and even my friends thought I was weird. I never fit in with any one group.<p>But I always felt like it was them that was f'ed up, not me. I never really lost confidence that I was okay, and that I was okay being myself, although it was lonely at times. Looking back I think it affected me more than I realize, because I was pretty anti-social for a while in my late-teen years. I don't have any friends from high school or earlier that I really keep in touch with.<p>Things started to get better in my second year of college, and I can honestly say that they've gotten better each year since. I moved away from my home state as soon as I finished college, and it's made all the difference. I couldn't be happier with my adult life, I have a lovely family, a good job and lots of friends. Sometimes I think that if I had fit in better as a kid I might have stayed close to home and missed out on the experiences that I've had as an adult. I don't think I'd change a thing.<p>So I would say to any kid that it's okay to be weird or different; embrace it and don't let anyone make you feel bad about it.",1288069488

Analyze the name and contexts of their brand IDs.  Don't emulate them in most cases.<p>Step six, combine steps 1-5 into a name that does three things:  communicates your products major functions, identifies the brand ID context that fits best for your customers, differentiates itself from existing competition.  A good method for doing this is to google search every potential idea.  If it has a lot of results, move on, the name is played out.<p>Oh, yeah, step seven:  Emotionally prepare yourself to defend whatever you decide is the best name for your product against all the random haters you tell your name to.<p>It only took me 4 days of obsessive, painful, brainstorming to develop the branding for my company and product!  It was not enjoyable by any stretch and I still have insecurities about them but deep down, I believe in the brand IDs I have.  I think you'll always have second thoughts but many great brand IDs are pretty terrible:  IBM, Shell, Facebook, Reebok (are you kidding me?), etc.",1288069235
