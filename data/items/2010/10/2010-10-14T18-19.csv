What's the worst that can happen?<p>When I started as a junior html developer I'd written exactly one website, a really poor 1997-era personal homepage. I didn't even know what a html table was, I'd never done forms, etc etc. It was a really junior role, but I figured I could learn what I didn't know on the spot. I stayed at that company for 4 years, and left with the job title ""Senior Database Programmer"". I'm now a highly experienced developer with some good academic qualifications too; I joined my first university on the strength of my experience alone, which was that first job.<p>Stop worrying and go for it. There's a crapload of documentation online, so even if you really are a bad developer you should be able to squeeze by until you become good enough.",1287082794

1792100,comment,1791718,1792061,0,0,jemfinch,,,"> Why don't we just abolish patents? The fashion and food industries seem to get by without them.<p>There are several things wrong with your proposition.<p>First, the food and beverage industries get by without patents because they leverage trade secrets, which is the exact sort of privatized knowledge that patents have long sought to prevent.<p>Second, fashion survives without patents because <i>names</i> matter.  People will buy Louis Vuitton whether it's good or not, simply because it has his name on it.  Louis Vuitton has no need for patents because it's not the bag design, but his <i>name</i> that matters.<p>The problem with abolishing patents is that while it might make it easier for companies, it would make it absolutely impossible for small-time, independent inventors to advance human knowledge.  What incentive is there for a couple guys to build a time machine in their garage when, as soon as they try to mass produce their invention, any number of larger companies better equipped to manufacture things at scale will just make their invention and sell it for less?<p>The problem with patents in this article isn't the patent itself, but the fact that it covers software, which is 50% math and 50% business process and shouldn't ever have been patentable in the first place.",1287082451

And heck, make the government do anything you want it to do. But that's not what I'm talking about.<p>Let's say you run a company with ten thousand workers. But they seem unhappy. One day a VP comes in and tells you that 30% of the workers are not able to read as much as they would like to stay current with their job.<p>So you, wise person that you are, implement a free book program. The next month the number hasn't changed much. So querying further, you find out that folks don't have enough time to read the books -- it's not that they can't afford them. So you implement extra time off on Fridays so folks can read.<p>Months later, no change. This time you bring in a comittee of experts. After much investigation, they find out that folks would rather play golf than read, and the extra time has just been spent on leisure activities instead of the reading. So you implement a program where folks can read at work on Friday afternoons.<p>Months later, no change. This time it turns out that the books they are reading are not job-related. So, after bringing in an expensive outside consulting team, you decide to put video cameras in the office...<p>What's happening? Are these people just lazy or what? Is management stupid? How many times do we have to set up the conditions where more reading can take place?<p>Two things have happened. First, you've confused the statistic with the individuals. The 30% who want to read more aren't necessarily the same as the ones playing golf, which aren't necessarily the same as the ones reading other books. But in your mind they're all the same.<p>You see, all you have is a metric, an aggregation of data. It's not like there's any one universal person out there -- everybody is unique. The system is made up of great variations in motives, ability, and circumstances. Teams of people work because they are all different, not because they are all the same.<p>But you'll keep on measuring, and keep on poking around, and the numbers will never do what you want them to do. Why? Because top-down, statistics-based reactive management is full of shit. Doesn't work for your company, doesn't work for other companies, doesn't work for the government.<p>That's not a political statement -- vote for your guys and do whatever you want to with the world. Lots of things need fixing. Let's go fix them. This has nothing to do with wanting less or more government. It's a statement on how systems of people operate.<p>People either understand that concept or they don't. And if they don't, they're always looking at aggregate numbers instead of system constraints. It's just a futile and endlessly spiraling methodology to fix any problem of any system of interacting people. It continues to fail over and over again, yet we keep framing the discussion this way. Probably because we have a vast lack of education in economics.<p>The final thing that's happened -- and this is the worst of all -- is that you've lost track of the goal for the metric. Somewhere along the way you're chasing percentages of folks reading books. What you really want is people leading happy and fulfilling work lives. But the minute you put a number on that, your abstraction starts carrying you away from your real goal. I've seen this happen over and over again, and I've never seen anybody go back to the original problem.<p>These are just stupid people tricks. All I'm saying is that we have to be aware of them to keep from repeating yet again for the hundredth time.<p>In reality, if you want to make people's lives better, you need to deal with one person and the thousand parameters around his or her life.

However building a business is much easier than establishing a culture you want that grows with the business.<p>Process is the alternative to culture as a route to long-term success and profitability.

The different between the entrepreneur and the artist is that for the entrepreneur it may take months or years before they are satisfied with their current piece, whereas the artist may take days to weeks to months to finish a piece and move on to the next.<p>Plus, deciding to move on to the next piece doesn't mean that you cannot stay on as an advisor to those who will continue to work on your previous pieces.",1287080201
