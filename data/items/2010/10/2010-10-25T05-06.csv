The cubicle walls were decently high -- you had to be pretty tall to peer over them -- but we were in a central location, so other developers, managers, execs, etc. were constantly walking by and scanning us and our screens.<p>Not that we were doing anything reprehensible, but the idea that we could work for 4 hours straight then spend 5 minutes on Slashdot and be shoulder-surfed by just the wrong person didn't sit well.<p>Well, during a tour of the new server room, we found a little side closet containing... leftover cubicle pieces!  Knowing it probably wouldn't fly, we ran the idea by the boss anyway: can we take the leftover pieces and build an entryway to our cubicle?<p>Hmm - he'd check on that and get back to us.  Soon the word came back -- kudos for our creativity, sure it was a neat idea, but due to fire regulations we couldn't extend our cube into that main hallway.<p>Okay, so he didn't want to mess with the status quo but didn't want to have to argue about it, so he was passing the buck, which I admit annoyed me a bit.  Fortunately, it's pretty trivial to call the local Fire Marshall and check this sort of thing, so I did.  Turns out that if your hallway is still as wide as the exit door, you aren't breaking any regulations, so the cube-mate and I brought lunch the next day, waited until the rest of the office went out to eat, and got out the allen wrenches.<p>We were just tightening the last bolts when or manager got back.<p>--Hey guys, now wait a minute -

Unlike many other time\task management tools it’s aimed to train your own productivity habits rather than to replace them with a software.<p>Who is it aimed for?
First of all for people who find themselves being hard to concentrate on their work, those who are easily distractable due to their work online. Also it is for people who’s hard to force themselves to create todo lists every day but they wish being organized. And of course it’s intended for IT people, those who spend much time online, since this is a web-based tool.<p>How it works?
Write any activity you are going to do and specify time to perform (or choose a thing from assigned for today). Even absolutely useless activity. 
After you have done it, check whether the activity was useful or not. Afterwards you can analyse how productively you spent your time, and how good you are in time estimations.<p>Also the project has built-in todo list with an ability to split complex things on steps (subtasks).<p>The project is in its early beta stage so any feedback highly appreciated.",1287982815
