Here's some feedback on them.<p>Downside:<p>- You pay the same price for your hardware every year even though that same hardware gradually gets cheaper for new customers.<p>- I pay $50 a month extra for a RAID 1 controller.  This seems pretty steep, although I guess I'll find out the true value of this once a disk dies.<p>The good:<p>- Hostgator is a down-to-earth company with pretty good customer service.  They aren't trying to re-invent the hosting business model to reap giant returns.  They do the basics and seem to have enough competent help to do this well.<p>- Several years ago I had shared hostgator server get hacked via an insecure wordpress install.
