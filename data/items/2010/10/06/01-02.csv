That coupon converted me to a regular, even though I always forget to bring it with me.  It reminds me to make an appointment with him, not one of the many other haircut options that I consider acceptable.  He got my home address by flat out asking if he could have it after I was a walk-in one day.<p>My wife's favorite spa has also figured out that sending me follow-on ads is a pretty effective sales pitch, as I semi-routinely say 'hey, she deserves another half-day at the spa.'  They got my email address from an initial online sale.<p>I don't get any follow-on advertising from donut places, but there's a local restaurant who uses email to fill out slow nights with some really nice prix fixe dinners.  Every now and then one shows up in my inbox, sounds delicious, and I don't feel like cooking, and they make an additional sale.  They started doing so after I made a reservation on OpenTable, and our dining frequency jumped substantially.",1286330352

1762383,comment,1760585,1760585,0,0,throwawaymuso,,,"This is a throw away account, I would prefer to remain anonymous. I work for a digital music startup and am privy to the kinds of tactics and ridiculousness that the major labels engage in on a regular basis. I should note however that I am a developer, not one of the guys that do the deal cutting as primary focus.<p>For example; they're well aware DRM does not work, but their insistence on the implementation of DRM is absolutely not focused anymore on the idea that they can stop piracy, but that they can implement market segmentation and suck the profit out of the kind of content that people actually want.<p>Case in point; digital music startup that charges a subscription for global access to a large library of content from the major labels charges a flat fee to the customer and is charged by the record labels on a pay per play basis, thus the effective margin that the startup makes is a function of (average amount of plays per user / subscription cost per month) - price paid to record label for the play. It turns out that if you do not use DRM for your player the record label leaves you around a 10% per play margin (on quite a hefty monthly subscription fee). With DRM it's much much more profitable for the startup in question, they bank on DRM being so repellent to customers that the startup will pay the much higher rate for DRM free.<p>They also micromanage the hell out of the details of implementation, for example they have a specific set of ""acceptable DRM"" standards which you must adhere to to be eligible for the rates in question. There have been negotiations running for <i>months</i> with them just to get approval to run the same kind of streaming clients as the web service provides available as applications to android / iPhone clients. When considering implementing AWS for site infrastructure one of the objections raised by the music companies was that ""they don't want their music on the cloud"".<p>Effectively it chokes what it is possible to do in the market, inflates the prices, and makes the entire offering far less appealing. It does seem like they're headed for destruction but they seem just as steadfast in their refusal to amend their course.",1286329390

If I were looking for a replacement keyboard, I would base most of my evaluation on three things:<p>- Does it separate out the hands?  This one does to some extent, but it looks like less than the Microsoft or Kinesis.<p>- How many keys do you need to press with your pinky?  What I like most about the Kinesis is that it moves many keys traditionally pressed with the pinky finger - control, alt, enter, backspace, delete - to under the thumbs.  It's much easier to hold the modifiers down with your thumb because the muscle is so much bigger, and it's nicer to hit enter/backspace because you don't have to stretch your finger.<p>- Does it have mechanical key switches instead of the plastic bubbles?  I don't know how good this one's are, but it's noticeably less work to press the switches and requires a constant/predictable amount of force on the Kinesis compared to the Microsoft and others.  This really adds up over a day of typing.",1286329291

(eg. the correct speed was probably under the limit), therefore driving 1-2KM/h slower the rest of the time would have absolutely no effect. This is why most accidents occur under the speed limit, because people are driving under the limit but too fast for the conditions.<p>What this study advocates is that we should drive a couple km/h slower ALL the time and what I'm saying is that we should drive faster than the limit almost ALL the time, however when conditions are bad we should drive SIGNIFICANTLY slower than the speed limit.<p>eg. Driving 5 km/h under the speed limit on the interstate on ice won't help you, but driving 5 km/h on ice on the interstate will. Unless you get hit by someone stupidly going 100 km/h on ice, my personal ice speed record is 140km/h in Idaho, but it took me 4 miles to slow down to 20 km/h.<p>We don't need to reduce our average speed, we need to reduce our speed greatly in very certain circumstances.",1286327741
