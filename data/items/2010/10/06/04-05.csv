The same legal term seems to be overloaded and used by state laws. For example from the Commonwealth of Virginia Laws (<a href=""http://leg1.state.va.us/000/cod/18.2-460.HTM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leg1.state.va.us/000/cod/18.2-460.HTM</a>):<p>> § 18.2-460. Obstructing justice; penalty.<p>A. If any person without just cause knowingly obstructs a judge, magistrate, justice, juror, attorney for the Commonwealth, witness, any law-enforcement officer, or animal control officer employed pursuant to § 3.2-6555 in the performance of his duties as such or fails or refuses without just cause to cease such obstruction when requested to do so by such judge, magistrate, justice, juror, attorney for the Commonwealth, witness, law-enforcement officer, or animal control officer employed pursuant to § 3.2-6555, he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.<p>Notice it says ""any person"" not just elected official.<p>> This seems very unlikely given the (1) the 5th amendment and (2) only judges can issue contempt of court citations.<p>Actually it is very likely because of (2).",1286340910

The problem is that most people won't stick with a service that doesn't offer the range of music they want to listen to.<p>And of course, the other issue with an all-indie catalog is that then you have a <i>lot</i> more players to negotiate with, many of whom will be just as clueless as the big labels.<p>So, you might be able to start a business with a small fraction of the indie labels represented, and appeal to a fairly small demographic, but there just isn't much room for growth there. I remember trying to use Emusic back in the day; while there was some music on there that I was interested in, it didn't even begin to cover most of what I was looking for.",1286340811

And by this I mean anywhere below 14th street... but even below 23rd street is fine.<p>This is contrary to other people's advice, but I've found that the subway quickly loses it's novelty appeal. Most jobs/meetups/startup activities are in Lower Manhattan, and taking an hour to get from Queens or deep Brooklyn to work becomes a headache, fast. On the other hand, most people are on a budget so you gotta do what you gotta do. Anywhere convenient is going to be expensive.<p>I will say that the pricing in Brooklyn is kooky now... Apartments in Williamsburg or Park Slope cost as much as they do in Manhattan. Shares are similar.

1762768,comment,1759761,1760004,0,0,bapadna,,,"In my experience, FreeBSD's greatest asset doesn't fit well on a feature list.  It's that it has a different attitude towards change than Linux.<p>Linux is a diverse ecosystem, with tons of experiments driving it forward.  Different package managers, different kernel patches, different userland configurations, different means of administration... and that's a great thing.<p>FreeBSD is not diverse or experimental.  FreeBSD is a deliberately moving beast, that adopts technologies and ideas in a more methodical manner, often after other OS's (OpenBSD / NetBSD / DragonflyBSD / Solaris / Linux / OS X) have proved that the ideas are solid, and lasting, and then it integrates them carefully, so it still looks like FreeBSD (but with some new capabilities, or better performance, or whatever), rather than having drastically different administration mechanisms, or performance characteristics, or anything else.<p>Personally, I like this stability.  I like that it's a platform that once learned, can be largely forgotten about.  But that said, it does require learning first, and while it's powerful, it's not shiny or sexy.  But even excluding the man pages and documentation, zfs, the pf firewall, and many other things I like about FreeBSD, this is the winner for me.  I just love that it doesn't change unless the change is a <i>large</i> win.",1286340616

Helps that jasonfried, a prime counter-example to this post, weighed in himself.<p>My take on it is simple: I passed this article along to my co-founder as a token of appreciation.  See, he started along the way without any coding experience.  He taught himself (with some pushes in the right direction) how to program, design, and even do some database stuff.  He's decent at it, but that isn't necessarily what matters.  What matters is now I have someone to discuss things with, someone who understands at least the basics (and has basic experience) with different design stuff.  That's not only helpful for productivity, but morale as well.<p>So, yeah, maybe learning to code isn't a requirement for a guy who can do everything nickpinkston listed.
