If someone takes over most of your job (and does it better) maybe you'd give them 5%-10% but that's a very extreme case. Most people should be getting 0.15% - 1.5% depending on their contribution. You don't necessarily have to decide up front. You can start people low and award options for performance.<p>Plan to distribute at most 20% of the company to employees over the next 5-7 years.",1286441899

My experience is that people aren't against things being done properly, it's only an issue when that gets in the way of what the feel really needs to happen.<p>If you come up against people who really just won't listen I tend to make a note of the fix, log it as a bug and include it in the next round of bug fixing, the next bit of quiet time or whatever.  Alternatively include the refactoring into the estimate the next time I'd have to do significant work on that module.<p>Two other points while I'm rambling:<p>Always make sure that the refactoring is genuinely necessary and not just polishing.  Some developers like ""perfect"" solutions but often this results in over engineering and significantly increased timescales.  The key question I find useful is ""am I coding for a specifically stated requirement or probable edge case or am I extrapolating to what I think might be useful / needed in the future?"".  I'm with Kent Beck on code only for what you specifically need today.<p>Secondly, only real issue with this approach I've outlined is if someone micromanages your time so heavily that you can't do any of that AND they won't listen to reason.

C, Lisp, and Haskell are the Latin of the CS world.<p>Since you're at MIT, take the famous Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs (used to be 6.001, not sure if it still is).  <a href=""http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussma...</a>.

But I heartily recommend resisting that pressure, doing it right, and mastering the enduring fundamentals first.  It may cost you something in immediacy and expedience, but that's what school is for, especially one such as MIT.  You should carefully weigh how you spend your time there, and unless you think you've got the next Facebook, focus on mastering the enduring concepts, not the trends.  You'll be glad you did the rest of your life and career.<p>PS - there's little to nothing that Clojure (a Lisp dialect on the JVM) and Haskell can't do in the web space, so the cost in immediacy and expedience is slim to none anyway.<p>PPS - it didn't register till just now that you're an Econ Major not going into CS or Software Engineering as a career.  If you just want a tried-and-true, versatile, easy-to-get-started-with language with tons of libraries and frameworks (reusable code) to hack in, huge and helpful community go with Python.  Java is too bureaucratic a language for this purpose.<p>Start with Zed Shaw's excellent introduction, Learn Python the Hard Way (hard way = by doing lots of follow-along examples until it gets into your brain muscle memory), then go from there.<p><a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index</a>",1286440091
