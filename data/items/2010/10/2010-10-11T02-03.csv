That seems to do this for LISP.<p>Now, if you wanted to provide all the <i>rest</i> of CPAN for LISP, that would be really cool.  Automated testing across platforms, some kind of standardized documentation of projects so you know what each one is (even without POD, surely something could be done - doesn't LISP at least have docstrings or something?), a search facility, etc.<p>That would be fun.

In a fight between a car and a pedestrian the pedestrian loses (big time) so pedestrians have a higher vested interest in their own safety. I know what the light changes are at intersections I cross a lot. Where are these cops when cars sail through red lights or nearly run over pedestrians when turning when the pedestrians have right of way?<p>So pedestrians can do whatever they want because its more dangerous for them?  Did you know that a flashing red hand means ""don't walk""?  You can be ticketed by entering the crosswalk when it is flashing.  How many of your close calls would that eliminate?<p>As a driver, what is your first instinct when you see someone in the middle of your path on the road?  I also hate people who jaywalk onto medians - how do I know they're going to stop when they get there?  Especially if they're running at full speed.  I've also had several pedestrians almost jaywalk right out infront of my car before, some not noticing me until I honked at them (too close to stop).<p>We would <i>all</i> be safer if we <i>all</i> followed the rules.

1778597,comment,1777385,1777564,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I thought the same thing going in (I played for a living for almost 6 years) but discovered that you can't lead a perfectly healthy and otherwise normal life. And I'm pretty sure it isn't just that I couldn't, because once you get to know them you realize not one of the hundreds of successful professional poker players (much less the thousands of unsuccessful ones) have managed it. Some have gotten part of the way there, some have become sad junkies, but nobody's ever anything that even remotely resembles normal.<p>My theories as to why would be too long for this forum, but the two big ones are the losing streaks and lack of respect for money.<p>Losing streaks are like nothing you can understand until you've been a professional poker player. Imagine if you went to work, performed flawlessly, far better than all of your coworkers, and instead of getting paid your bank account got debited and your boss told you ""you really sucked today"". Then that happens every day for a month.<p>Humans (and especially poker players, who study probabilistic decision making as a hobby) are conditioned through life to believe outcomes are a direct result of actions. Do a good job at something and work hard at it, you succeed. Do a bad job at something and slack off, you fail.<p>While this is true in poker in the long run, the long run can be a long time. I broke even for a year at one point, and that's at cash games. Meanwhile donkeys without the slightest clue what they were doing were lucking ass backward into multimillion-dollar tournament prizes.<p>You can't even fathom what this does to you emotionally until you've lived through it. It engenders self-doubt, which gets you off your game, which probably makes you play worse, which you know you're doing but aren't sure exactly how, or what to do about it, which in turn prolongs the losing streak. There is no end to it.<p>The lack of respect for money is universal in a world where thousands of dollars change hands in minutes. It's impossible to think ""I shouldn't buy that Lexus I've had my eye on"" when you just made enough to do it in the last 4 hours. Everytime I played a pot I was risking far more than I was playing credit card roulette for dinner for 4 at Craftsteak. (BTW, my luck at credit card roulette is legendary. If my luck at poker had been half that good I'd have won the WSOP.)",1286765082

1778591,comment,1778185,1778185,0,0,hmsp,,,"Hi,<p>I've lived in India for the last few years working as a web designer/programmer.  I worked for people in the US - a few clients and would make about 15K per year USD.  This was more than enough to live and do as I pleased in India as well as travel around the area - it's really a great life style.<p>The price of living in India varies based on location - I once rented a house from a family in the Himalayas for 30 dollars per month - add on the fact that I cooked most of my own food and probably only spent $100 max per month.  I've also taken $100 hotel rooms in really neat little boutique type hotels in places like Ahmedabad and Delhi - so as you can see anything is possible.  Generally, though, you can hire a nice room in a guest house for 10 dollars a day (max) and eat for $10 as well - this would be living pretty nice.  If you can handle it you could get by for much less - not as little as you used to - but $10 a day would be very easy $5 is possible but you might not like what it entails.<p>But again - it just depends upon where you are.  India is very nice but living in New Delhi or Bangalore would be akin to insanity.  Living in the Himalayas or on the beaches in the south or the any other small town is an amazing experience - and cheap.  Also, there is a HUGE traveler scene in India so you are never alone.<p>I've worked some for people in Asia and generally would hire myself out at $500 per month.  It's not really worth it - you'd be much more satisfied in doing volunteer work for a project you have a passion for - and then maintaining a bit of freelance work back home that pays you real money.  This is what I've done and it works quite well.  You'd be amazed that even half way around the world you can still get jobs - and the fact that you spend about 4 or 5 times less than you earn means the downtime between jobs is just like a long vacation.<p>If you are thinking about it - just go and do it.  I know that it's the same in the rest of asia/se asia and south america: everything is cheaper - 3 times less, 5 times less, or even half the cost which is how i've found mexico.  But these cheaper prices make the work you get stretch that much further.<p>Once you get the people you work for used to the idea that you are not in the same country it is really not a big deal at all anymore - it's the same as you are in another town.  One thing which really helps is to just call them randomly and check in or clarify something which is hard to explain via email - and skype makes this trivial and cheap.<p>Let me know if you have specific questions and I can elaborate.",1286764884

Our family of 4 (2 young children) live on about £1000, ie $1600 - we have a private home with a bedroom each, run a car (necessary for work otherwise it we'd ditch it and use mass transit) and eat a moderately varied diet with meat/fish twice a day. I would say ours is probably unsustainable long term (clothing, building maintenance, increasing costs for the children) but a couple of hundred £GBP a month would be enough to change that (sadly the poverty trap probably means that we'd have to go to both being in full-time paid employment requiring full-time childcare just to get that £200 extra; poll tax mounts, allowances decline).<p>Anyway, my point was I'm surprised by your figures for India. Cost of living seems a lot higher that I'd expect. But here's the rub - ""decent living"" has vastly different interpretations.

I expect the expenses to shoot out of the ceiling after marriage. :)<p>EDIT: Less than 6 months ago I was trying to get a startup up and running and I was living off my savings.

While I don't agree with a lot of the author's remarks, I certainly feel his pain and empathize with the idea that noodling or other aimless, low-motivation and low-direction play does not lead to the kind of expertise that will get you hired by the kind of people who use Haskell/F# to make money.<p>But this kind of remark seems wildly baseless. Is he postulating that if we find a bank using J2EE or Rails that you can get hired based on a few chapters of reading and a web site? This is not consistent with the rest of the article.<p>What I take away from the article is that he believes banks are very demanding, not that Haskell/F# is very demanding. In which case, if he finds himself at a J2EE bank, he's going to be discussing the kinds of things I recall working with in one of the world's biggest banks: the behaviour of transaction queueing systems, type erasure and its effects on reflection in the presence of certain generics, subtle considerations when using JDBC and Oracle, or whatever is now the kind of thing J2EE people lose sleep over (my knowledge is out of date, the things I mentioned may now be passé).",1286764193

You are correct in thinking there are only two options - a merchant account or a service like paypal or authorize.net. However, if you have a merchant bank account and use a 3rd party gateway, you are submitting and storing the credit card information on the gateway and not on your own server, therefore PCI DSS complaince is not required. Many credit card gateways have APIs so that you can create a seamless experience if you wish.
I would certainly try approaching the banks for a merchant account. Our company was fairly new when we got our merchant facility and there was never any concern about how old the business was. They were more interested in the type of product and thus the risk of getting charge backs. The bank may also be happy to provide the facility for a security deposit.
Also, before you make a final decision, compare all the charges and how much the facility is going to cost your business. The charges seem to vary dramatically between banks and providers.",1286763612

This page partially loads but then dies because my NoScript Firefox add-on disallows the JS on the page. I'm left looking at a button that says something like ""Click to enter your password"" but due to JS being disabled, it does nothing when you click on it and even if it did, I would not know what password to enter. I do some Googling on Verified by Visa and how it might relate to our particular bank, but find very little other than pages filled with sales-speak on how Verified by Visa makes things more secure.<p>* Conversation ensues: Me: ""Do you have a password for your Visa card?"" SO: ""Password? I have a pin number..."" Me: ""No I think it's different to your pin number"" SO: ""I have no idea what you're talking about."" Temperature starts to rise as it's late and it's been a long day. Conversation escalates but is defused just in time before it goes nuclear.<p>* I enable JS, the page then reloads and errors out because now it's been detected that I've done something out of the ordinary flow and it's all bets off. I get back to the original ink cartridge website to find my shopping cart empty.<p>* I select all the products I want to purchase once more and not realising at this stage what Verified by Visa actually is and my tired and befuddled mind already convinced that the bank has enrolled my SO in some added security scheme and that she's forgotten that they gave her a password, I try using my own MasterCard to pay and find out that actually I hit the same thing, only with MasterCard it's called MasterCard SecureCode. Fortunately, Since I enabled JS last time, I get through it this time, interestingly without having to enter any password, even though the explanatory text on the page still tells me I will need to. This is lucky because I have no password for my MasterCard either.<p>* The next day, SO goes to the bank, the person behind the counter has no idea what Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode actually is. They tell her they do not supply passwords for credit cards. SO calls me and asks me to explain what happened to the person at the bank, more frustration ensues. SO eventually finds someone at the bank who knows vaguely what she's talking about and he tells her that they don't supply passwords for credit cards, but that you should be able to set one up through the checkout process of this random,  not particularly trusted website that she buys printer cartridges from.<p>* I do more research and find out that yes, this is all in fact 3-D Secure under different names and I now have a rough idea of what the deal actually is.<p>I'm going to have to put some of the blame for this whole cluster fuck onto myself because I'm meant to know about this stuff, I'm paranoid enough to be using NoScript and that night was not my most blindingly brilliant moment of deductive reasoning in general.

If you made a DNS request to the I-root during that leak, and the best route to the I-root prefix was the leaking route from China, then your DNS traffic went through the great firewall and was altered accordingly.<p>Finally, I want to give the article the benefit of the doubt with regard to this:<p><pre><code>  And he said he believes there were more instances of Web traffic 
  being diverted to China, or ""hijacked,"" around that time, but 
  wouldn't elaborate. ""I believe it happened more than twice,""

  information is not generally public.""

but <i>many</i> views of the BGP routing table are public (<a href=""http://routeviews.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://routeviews.org</a>) and/or fairly well monitored for hijackings, etc. by network operators and others like Renesys and BGPMon (<a href=""http://bgpmon.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bgpmon.net/</a>). Unless this is occurring only within China's regional networks, I expect we would've heard something about this already.",1286762915

Moving up too soon thinking they are the best in the world, only to lose it all.<p>(For non players, this means that you are a winner at lower stakes, say $5/10 - but a common trait is that you become bored with that level because the most you can win each day is ~$1000-3000. As you move up levels the play is a lot harder (exponentially so). Players like this guy crush the small levels and think they are good enough for the higher levels, and just end up losing it all - often blaming their luck in the process. If you look at his chart, you will see that he won it all playing medium stakes, and lost it all (in a lot shorter time) playing high stakes).",1286762873

1778518,comment,1778509,1778509,0,0,NathanKP,,,"According to the article:<p><i>On October 1, 2010, Blizzard began the unprecedented act of suspending and banning players for the use of cheats and trainers in SINGLE PLAYER games of Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty. Users found to be using cheats in SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN MODE and AI SKIRMISH mode were treated the same as if they had cheated in a multiplayer online match. For some, their accounts were suspended and for others their CD keys were disabled and they were completely locked out of playing even campaign mode in their legally purchased game.</i><p>This seems utterly ridiculous to me. Players have already purchased the game, and it seems to me that after that point Blizzard should no longer have control of what they do with the game in single player mode, on their own computer.<p>Perhaps since it keeps track of player rankings they are concerned about cheating in local single player games artificially inflating the achievements and gamer score of some players.<p>However, I still find it strange that Blizzard should take the stance that they still own the software and can take away your access after you have bought it, for doing something with it on your own personal computer, in single player mode.",1286762595

When we opened our business here, we actually had the change to go this route, but choose not to because it would have been more hassle though.<p>Could you elaborate on how it went with your business? I'd like to learn more because I like some parts of Thailand, but I always heard differently. Here's the top google result, for instance:<p>""A foreigner can form or buy a Thai company, and even be the sole director of it, but Thai citizens must jointly own at least 51% of its shares – meaning a majority is technically under Thai control. Currently it is possible to allocate shares to several unrelated people, who could have no combined effect on the company's business, and this can be arranged by the lawyer, but along with most things connected with business in Thailand, there are considerable risks involved.""<p><a href=""http://www.retire-asia.com/thaibiz.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.retire-asia.com/thaibiz.shtml</a><p>Actually, the whole article is generally very cautionary and negative against a foreigner owning a business in Thailand, which jives with what I've heard people who spend time there say.<p>Maybe it's only businesses with real estate ownership or leases that come under these terms? EX, no real estate, then don't worry about it? I think regardless, you'd be fine working from your laptop.<p>Anyways, I'm curious if you want to elaborate more. International business law is one of those things that every little bit you know becomes more helpful in understanding the broad picture of how markets work, imports/exports work, etc. It's something I try to pay attention to, research, and ask questions about when I'm visiting a place.",1286762486
