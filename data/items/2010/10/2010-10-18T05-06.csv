I'm laughing.<p>Evolutionary biology, compare to lets say mathematics where my roots are, has a very large part which is ""interpretation"" and which is very susceptible to whatever is dictated by the current authority in the science (and/or by political climate).<p>With regard to laughing - how about evolution biologists who thinks that evolution, a large statistical dynamic system process, has produced different bodies for males and females (or are you going to argue that as well?) efficiently reflecting specialization, and ignored for the reason of PolitCorrectness another available degree of freedom extremely important in the context of the specialization - mental abilities, brain (especially considering that for K-selection  behavioral/mental characteristics may be playing comparable or even more important role than pure physical body characteristics)<p>> Consequently they have superior navigation skills to the females who never leave their burrows.<p>For many, many generations ... Are you, as evolutionary biologist, saying that female squirrels have the same abilities to develop such navigational skills? When did they develop them? While never using? 
Let suppose they did develop them in some past. Thus we can suppose the abilities are just dormant now. May 
be the female squirrels also have dormant penises?",1287381588

It's easy to make available, in many cases you're even being taunted by publicly displaying its availability, and then telling you you can't have it. As far as I'm concerned, if that's your way of dealing with customers, all bets are off.<p>Second, copyright laws aren't a question of ethics. They are very artificial (nothing is being ""stolen"" or removed, copies are not the original property) laws that have originally been created to <i>promote</i> the distribution of original work. If it's being abused to do exactly the opposite, again, as far as I'm concerned any ethical considerations become null and void.<p>And don't get me started on deliberately crippling a legally acquired product with crap like DRM.",1287381159

In classic rhetoric, the ability to control and define the terms is the means to control and define the argument. If you honestly seek a fair resolution, step back from the politics and word-smithing by trying to address everything as fairly as possible including the terms used.<p>Given that I respect tptacek for being bright, level headed, and having a good mind for reverse engineering and analysis, I had hoped to get him into a friendly discussion addressing root causes:
<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1798540"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1798540</a><p>Human nature is acquisitive, but this manifests itself in two distinct ways; for a group or for an individual. In the former, there is a part of human nature wanting collaboration (for group), so we want to return favors and want to reward efforts. In the latter, there is a contrasting part of human nature more avariciously (selfish, greedy) inclined to benefit the individual, so there is also a desire to not return favors and not reward efforts.<p>Copyright laws are an attempt to enforce the former, and of course, copyright infringements are an attempt to enforce the latter. The former creates ""monopoly"" and the latter creates ""theft"" but both of these terms are rhetorically loaded, and worse, both of them are a detriment to markets.<p>The important question is, can we design a better system to both fairly reward efforts of collaboration and at the same time also benefit individuals?<p>It's a very tough question, but until people are willing to step back from their biases and heated opinions, we will not be able to figure out a better solution.",1287380913

This should be done over multiple time periods, to evaluate whether the trend of a few hours or days is just a temporary pullback in a longer weeks-to-months progression. Technical analysis gives important information for timing position entries and exits - and if you screen on both the fundamentals and technicals, you have more tools to narrow things to a few top picks.<p>An example set of signals I might use to find a bullish stock: Upward-trending SMA-20 and SMA-50, 14-period RSI > 50, MACD 12-26-9 signal line under value line. If trading actively, enter when all signals are ready, exit as soon as one breaks. (haven't actually tried that particular system, but I know for a fact that similar systems work.)",1287380745

The poor bastards, after spending their last bit of disposable income on virtual cows and sheep are either willing to or are unknowingly handing over the keys to their personal information in order to keep getting their daily hits of the social gaming drug.<p>So, how does the personal information get extracted from the consumer and put into the hands of the ad network?<p>In the middle, you've got the granddaddy of all personal data warehouses, Facebook, whose future rests upon bringing consumers to their site in order to gather personal information for their ad platform or, more recently, to reap the cash cow of virtual game items through the credits system they're launching.<p>And finally, next to the advertisers, you've got the aggregators, who are jumping through whatever hoops necessary in order to get this information in order to provide it directly to ad networks through a nice, clean, fast API or tracking cookie for the ad networks to use.<p>According to the article allegedly they're getting the social gaming providers to send it along. So the circle's complete. If the story is true (and I'm not sure it is), they're basically keeping the social gaming companies profitable by either paying them for this data or allowing them to use it for more efficient advertising. Their survival makes Facebook happy, since it's driving more people back to the site and giving them more Facebook credit revenue. Facebook would never be able to build this type of direct-to-the-ad-network data pipe the ad networks need to operate, but certainly benefits from it existing.<p>What's happening here is what I'm going to coin right here on HN: ""information laundering."" Facebook doesn't give away your personal information, they give it to innocent gaming companies. Who then give it to aggregators. Who then give it to advertising networks. Plausible deniability for everyone!<p>It's almost beautiful how it's all come together, each member of this ecosystem now dependent on the next. If any single person pulls the plug, the whole thing comes crashing down. It seems the valley's created a monster. No, it's not a conspiracy. It's just everyone acting ""rationally selfish."" But this behavior should come as no surprise to anyone who has been watching the majority of the types of companies launching at conferences the last several years.<p>So, what's next? Here's the worrisome part. The aggregation and dissemination of this type of personal information has been up until now largely used (we assume) for benign purposes like advertising. But, we're now in an era where access to this information is easy (APIs) and access to massive computing power (AWS) and analysis tools (Hadoop) is cheap.<p>It doesn't take much of an imagination to come up with ways this information can be used for far more nefarious purposes than selling weight loss pills. Surely the politicians are already plugged into this in order to craft advertising to manipulate people into voting for their guy. But it could be much worse than this, of course.<p>The truth is, the ""information trade"" will likely have the same connotation as the ""drug trade"" for the Millennials as they get older. As soon as there is a mainstream story about how this type of leak has ruined lives, or directly led to large scale fraud, blackmail, or even violence, things will start to happen.<p>I expect the next phase of this will play out in the press (expect alarmist articles like this one to be followed with more alarmist news pieces on TV) until some politician (as likely a Republican or Democrat, for different reasons of course) takes it up as their pet cause. It will start as ""think of the children!"" but over the years this will turn into ""think of us!"" as the children turn into the adults.<p>I expect to see legislation eventually that criminalizes a lot of the practices going on today with regards to aggregating and transmitting large amounts of personal information.",1287379179
