In order for everything to appears perfectly focused, doesn't the glasses have to generate light rays that are just out of focus enough so your lens refocuses it correctly?

I have my doubts, though. The abstract to Zalevsky's paper (see my comment on this HN post) ends as follows:<p>> This is achieved by exploiting the capacity of the visual system for adaptation to contrast as well as its capability of creating a coherent continuous visual field out of discrete lines of sight.<p>So simply focusing light on the retina is apparently not the goal. Rather, it appears that the brain is being sent unusual signals, which it is nonetheless capable of interpreting. In other words, there isn't just optics going on here; there is also some interesting neurology.<p>> Wild.<p>Indeed.",1286207919

This is of a category with the OP's comments about the elderly.<p>Pretty much all the other comments I've seen reference <i>negative liberty</i>, meaning that it regards our freedom <i>from</i> something, e.g., freedom from censorship.<p>However, you're talking about <i>positive liberty</i>, which is a fundamentally different thing: it posits that society owes us something.<p>The arguments for negative liberty are generally easier to make because they only force people to leave you alone.<p>The argument for positive liberty are much more difficult, because they force an obligation upon everyone. This suffers from slippery-slope problems, and clearly breaks down at the margins. Since healthcare (to take your example) requires the expenditure of resources, we must first determine to what level we are obligated (which is completely arbitrary, as far as I can see). And when resources are limited, it requires that we forsake that moral obligation (in other words, it may place us into a situation for which all possible actions are immoral).",1286207876

But, if the first mover locks up key resources for success then that gives a sustainable advantage.  This can be done by fast followers also.  The competitive advantage strategy should be to capture resources so that competitors can't access them.  For instance, he mentioned Walmart strategy of buying key locations before their competitors figure out that these location were necessary for success.<p>Other means of locking in resources may include contracts with suppliers and with authorities or patents.  The main theme is to block competitors from resources they need for success.",1286207836

As such, the way I've done it may not help but what the heck, can't hurt.<p>I listen to people, especially customers and potential customers, and pattern match.  Been doing it for years.  I try and get them to tell what problem they want solved but they rarely do that, they tell me what they want to buy.  It's up to me to work backwards to what problem it is they want solved.  Key point: listen to them, but not to what they want, find the problem they want solved.<p>Once you work out the problem, just shove it in a mental hash indexed by problem name and yielding a counter.  Each time you see a problem, bump the counter.<p>When you are looking for a problem to solve, look through the hash at the ones that have high counters.  Pick the one that you think you might be able to solve, looks interesting, looks like people will pay for it.<p>Believe it or not, that has worked for me for years, extremely well.  It's perhaps hard to see that if you are in school or new in the industry.  I remember what that felt like, it felt like I didn't know what to do.  I remember thinking I couldn't come up with a good idea for a PhD thesis.  I went to Sun and within a year or three had literally dozens of ideas, any one of which would have made (IMO) a fantastic thesis.<p>I'm not sure how to apply this to today's world.  It worked for me because I went to work for a large company that had lots of potential customers.  Marketing figured out that I liked to talk to customers and customers liked to talk to me (I was in the kernel group at Sun).  I learned to keep a clean shirt hanging on the back of my door because I'd get random calls saying ""Hey, lm, ATT is at PAL-1, can we swing by and get a brain dump on the clustering stuff?"" which would lead to wide ranging discussions of what they wanted us to build.  Access to those customers was <i>huge</i>, they were the source of the problems that needed to be fixed.<p>TL;DR summary - listen to customers, work backwards to the problem they need solved, build up a list of those, work on the one with the most hits.",1286207546

We definitely wouldn't trust some webapp's javascript to decrypt for us, unless we'd written it ourselves.<p>Then there's the question, which someone alluded to, of how to distribute new credentials to a browser that hasn't logged on before, and how to make sure they're deleted securely after I leave.  Do you store the private keys encrypted and send them to the browser so they can be decrypted with my passphrase?  I probably don't trust you to store even an encrypted version of my private keys, but I guess I can use a throwaway key for your service.<p>What I'm most worried about is the question: who is doing the encrypting?  Are people sending mail to this address <i>required</i> to encrypt email to me?  If not, are you going to encrypt my email as soon as it hits your servers?  Not good enough, you may as well leave it in plaintext and use it to serve me ads.<p>The biggest problem with encrypted email today is that nobody uses it, and this doesn't fix that.  It makes it easier (if it works, and I'm still not convinced it does) for people who already use it to do so, but it doesn't convince people that don't use the service (which is going to be a vast percentage of the people that don't use pgp now) that they should want encrypted mail.",1286206572
