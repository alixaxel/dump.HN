It's in the notion that Mark Hurd was fired for no reason beyond his ethical indiscretions. The article rather questionably refers to him as a 'popular CEO' (with whom?). There's repeated mention of 'Playboy model'. Of course it's lurid. Did Mark Hurd's behaviour harm shareholders more than, say, Apple (which still retains its CEO of the time) backdating stock option grants?",1286589571

It's $1500 (I think) maximum, but we still only pay the routine $20 co-pay for normal visits... $75 for emergency room.<p>I don't think we've ever actually spent more than $100 out of pocket over and above the monthly premiums. If something went terribly wrong, however, that cap would mean we'd owe at most $1500/yr.

Most of the comments on this thread are defending this app and yes, it does what it sets out to accomplish. However, are we so much in an echo chamber that we don't realize how the things we build affect other humans?! We deal in a world of systems, where point A leads to point B. But the systems we put in place are interpreted by human minds and human emotions, all of which don't have a point A or point B. I have a friend whose family doesn't go back more than 2 generations because they were all murdered by Hitler's regime at Auschwitz.<p>It's easy to make <i>stupid</i> apps (your word) but, in a post earlier today about creating apps for the greater good (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1770435"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1770435</a>), this is just blatantly adding bad.
