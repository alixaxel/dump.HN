To avoid that, you should do everything in your power to leave on good terms with him. First, talk to him in a non-confrontational way: ask him if there's anything that's getting in the way of his giving the project more attention. Politely let him know that you expect more of him, as a business partner, and see if he steps up. Set a concrete but reasonable goal date (I'd do about a month from now), and on that day, decide if you want to keep working with him for the next year or not. If you leave, suggest getting back together after he has a chance be more focused/organized/whatever.<p>I wouldn't bring lawyers into something like this until the very end, as they can put a very grim aura on the conversation. Have a heart-to-heart, figure out what you want, what he wants, and how both of you can be satisfied. Once you're sure of that, see a lawyer about making a legally binding agreement.",1286664752

Or indeed why there should be any reason beyond simple preference. More women like milk chocolate; more men like dark (pulled that one out my arse incidentally). Does it matter?<p>If you take a gender blind view then you only have to look at individuals and say - ""were you discriminated against due to prejudice?"" if not then no foul.<p>There's a natural skew I think: if both men and women equally wanted to start families then more women would normally be able to than men (artificial insemination, one-night stand, stop using birth control, decide contrary to the male to not have an abortion, whatever). This leaves more men doing startups whether they prefer that to starting a family or not.<p>No, I'm not saying this accounts for any discrepancy I'm just saying this seems to be a reasonable explanation as to why there might be an imbalance and that these sorts of possibilities lead me to think that should it be clear there is no discrimination then it is highly unlikely that equal numbers of any two sub-populations (male-female, blue eyes-brown eyes, ...) occupy a particular field.",1286663559

The missing bloodbath was in reference to the reasoning a lot of people in the US used to prolong the war. The theory was that if the US leaves everyone in the south would be massacred, so we must stay for humanitarian reasons. That was wrong, the North Vietnamese did not massacre civilians after they won. Again this has nothing to do with Cambodia.<p>The other stuff you have written there is just silly. Were you in Vietnam before the war? Can you really make the comparison? Are you sure that as a French colony, when most Vietnamese were either peasants or more or less slaves working on French rubber plantations, Vietnam was more prosperous than it is now?
