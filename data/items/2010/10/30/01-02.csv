1849835,comment,1849142,1849726,0,0,mattmanser,,,"Cars are dangerous. Sky diving is dangerous. Walking across a busy street is dangerous.<p>Having just lived through one of my parents going totally and utterly mad having taken absolutely no drugs whatsoever and having seen the vast majority of my friends at some point in their life taking 'dangerous' drugs let me tell you with total and utter certainty that there is nothing at all dangerous about marijuana, ecstasy, lsd, cocaine or speed. Well certainly compared to driving a car or going out for a drinking binge.<p>An extremely temporary sensation of happiness or fun is nowhere near as dangerous to a person as a manic or depressive episode, the latter two being states of mind being entirely brought on by your own brain with absolutely no 'dangerous' drug being involved.<p>And this is even before we mention alcoholism, ocd or the plethora of other brain diseases our own bodies can inflict on us.<p>In order to combat illnesses of the brain, your doctor will prescribe drugs which are fundamentally more brain altering than many of your 'dangerous' drugs. My mother can barely read a sentence in a paper at the moment. Most of my friends got degrees from universities after their 'dangerous' drugs.<p>And the next argument that blows your utterly preposterous and medieval argument out of the water is that brain altering drugs are on sale today.<p>Caffeine, Alcohol, Tobacco, probably even Chocolate and Sugar. And this is before we consider the addictive drugs that are pumped into burgers, fries, milkshakes, sweets and all the dodgy fast food being sold today across the world. Oh, sorry, I mean 'food additives'. Of course they're totally safe because McDonald's paid your senator to say so.<p>History is the only precedent that makes them acceptable.<p>That anyone can be sent to prison for owning any 'dangerous' drug, especially when up to 50% of the population have at some point taken them, is an utter travesty of freedom and common sense. Worst still is that the poorer communities pay the price, locked away for ridiculous amount of years compared to the widely published and yet bizarrely low sentence celebrities arrested for drug offences.<p>This is a war of false morality, waged by middle class people who themselves have in all probability at some point actually taken these drugs and yet still vote with 'hard-on-drugs' politicians. They are hypocritical fools.",1288403988

If the alternative is guarding every function call with an if statement to check for error codes, I'll take exceptions almost every time. (Many game programmers I know think that checking for errors is usually bad game programming style, period, but I'm assuming Carmack isn't one of those people.)<p>Exceptions do have possibly deleterious effects on performance, but then, you can just be judicious about where you use them. Exceptions are at least appropriate for catastrophic failures like, ""Oops, the game just crashed,"" or, ""Your network connection died.""

I'm currently employed and don't get high on the job, but I code on my side projects high pretty often.  But I don't generally get high with the intentions of coding.  Usually it's just that I happen to be high and just want to code and make progress on my projects.  Often times it's not until I've sobered up a little (but not completely) before I start coding, though.<p>I didn't used to do this when I was younger (I'm 32 now).  In college I found that while I could do homework high, it usually resulted in me correcting a bunch of errors the next day, so I reserved pot (and alcohol) for when I was finished with my work.  But these days I'm so compelled to work on side projects that having used pot (and sometimes alcohol) earlier in the evening just doesn't stop me from putting in a few hours before bed time.<p>As a side note: I gave up regular usage of caffeine after I got out of college.  I found I no longer needed it once I was able to get 7-8 hours of sleep every night instead of 4.

In reality, food prices of both subsidized and unsubsidized crops are relatively stable. Given that the percentage of family budgets spent on food has dropped from 25 percent to 10 percent since 1933, any potential price instability would have an increasingly small impact on family budgets.[7] Even if price stabilization was necessary, price support programs have largely been replaced by commodity subsidies that stimulate overproduction rather than stabilize prices.\nNor do farm subsidies contribute to lower food costs. Two-thirds of food production is unsubsidized and thus relatively unaffected by subsidies. Of the remaining one-third, price reductions caused by crop subsidies are balanced by conservation programs that raise prices. Furthermore, food prices are based not only on crop prices, but also on food processing, transportation, and marketing costs. Bruce Babcock, professor of economics at Iowa State University, has calculated that eliminating farm subsidies would have virtually no effect on food prices.[8]<p><a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/06/how-farm-subsidies-harm-taxpayers-consumers-and-farmers-too"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2007/06/how-farm-su...</a>",1288402185

You'll live to regret it when you need to represent the same model in more than one place at once, or refactor your UI.<p>* Events are the way to go, when connecting changes in the model to updates in the view. Ideally, models know nothing about what UI happens to be on the screen at any given moment.<p>* If you're going to be doing interesting business logic in the client, it helps to have collections (in this case, Backbone.Collection) with a richer API than JS arrays: filter, any, map, reduce, reject, include, invoke...<p>* Lots of little testable JS files for development, one minified gzipped file for production.<p>The one point I'm in disagreement with is: ""Keep your models as simple as possible"". In my opinion, client-side models really shine when they contain a large part of your important JS business logic, and you can use the same models in different situations to provide access-control, URL generation, data munging, etc.<p>For example, here's a list of some of the methods we have on a Backbone.Model called ""Document"": viewerUrl, publishedUrl, canonicalId, openViewer, openText, openPdf, allowedToEdit(account), checkAllowedToEdit(account, message), checkBusy, notes, uniqueEntities, isPending, isPublic, isPublished.",1288401152

I'd just like to underscore how amazing their samples are. The mean survival time of their patients, 2 years, is also surprising. (Survival bias?)<p>Getting at metastases is hard. In general it simply isn't medically necessary to biopsy them. Without medical necessity it's unjustifiable to put a patient through that risk and discomfort. Why are metastases important? Mostly because they're presumably cleaner than primary tumors.<p>In a primary tumor you start out some founder cell that has lost the ability to undergo programmed cell death. In general, DNA repair mechanisms are also awry. The cell divides producing daughter cells, the mutations add up and so on. The tumor becomes heterogeneous. The daughter cells diverge from one another. If you sample from the primary tumor you get plenty of mutations related to cancer, and plenty of mutations <i>unrelated</i> to cancer, simply because the genome is a big place. It is no fun to work with this data.<p>OK. Metastases. Some immortalized cell has lost basal lamina adhesion and migrated to another site in the body. This is a selective bottleneck -- all of those randomly mutated cells that didn't lose adhesion are stuck in the primary. The secondary should therefore be enriched for mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors. This is why this data is so important and could give some great insights into oncogenesis.<p>Heck, here's an experiment I would love to run:<p>* Collect biopsies from primary tumors in non-metastatic cases.<p>* Collect biopsies from metastases in another patient population.<p>* Look for mutations and changes in genome architecture that are unique/overrepresented in the metastatic cases.",1288400628
