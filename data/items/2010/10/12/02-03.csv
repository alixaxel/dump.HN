Without such standards people would make bad decisions.""<p>Bullshit.  What government agency prevents us from having exploding lightbulbs.  There isn't one.  It's done by Underwriter's Laboratory.  There is no good reason why we can't have an Underwriter's laboratory for food.  Or an underwriter's laboratory for medicines, instead of the FDA.  In fact we are seeing en mass rebellion against the USDA (particularly in the organic-certification area) where the USDA is seen as basically an agent that prevents upstart food producers and entrenches big-food interests that can afford to pay for extremely expensive certification.<p>You know what, the FDA screws up big time, too.  Remember how we had an e coli outbreak?  So what are you going to do when 'government standards' are 'inadequate'?",1286852364

Why, for example, was the interest rate so low, making it artificially easy to take on mortgages?  Why were home mortgage payments tax-deductible?<p>You think that these economic decisions are made in a vacuum, but you really ought to look in to the political decisions that were made to push people en masse into a series of economic moves that were probably unsustainable.  The notion that the most recent economic crises were a failure of the market is completely laughable.<p>Ironically, it's exactly the notion that government is supposed to ""prevent bad economic decisions"" that has resulted in centralization of economy (via the fed, via subsidization of bank risk, by subsidization -i.e. stealth corporate welfare- of retirements through 401ks, IRAs) - so that instead of a few bad actors getting punished for poor choices, risk is socialized and we all have to bail out the rich guys.",1286852118

If you have proof that someone is corrupted, just report it. (Btw, some govt guy just got charged for a huge corruption case.)

Many times the business personell value the leads and skills that they posses once a product exist while the developer values the fact that they are for all intents and purpose the product. Given the lack of knowledge about the subject of technical matters, I believe that many people see a programer as a programer much the same way that one would look at a CPA or an electrician. Just pick one, and get on with it is a prevailing attitude. With that can come a feeling of you should be lucky I am including you in on my idea, and that is where things deteriorate quickly. The non-technical person believes that they are bargaining from a position of power and the technical person (the kind that can get it done) knows just how scare they are. Generally the non-technical person only finds this out after the fact. Anyway the non-technical person walks away from the experience thinking that all technical personell are difficult and have unreasonable expectation, when in fact it is they who are putting up unreasonable demands if one where to break down the value proposition.

Two-factor authentication is something you know (username and password) and something you have (dongle, ID, etc). Our two-factor is powered by phonefactor and is a great way to serve this need.<p>6. We use other methods to ensure this doesn't happen. (Encryption and Database Monitoring with strict rules).<p>7. Correct.<p>8.
