Sort of how like, when I was growing up not many 12 year olds could hit a jump shot from the three point line as often as one of the neighborhood boys (who we'll call Anthony) could, but your status as popular or not in the neighborhood completely depended on your ability to hit a jumper.<p>It's not a thing of statistics as much as it is a remark about the culture of being ""relevant"".<p>Just wanted to share an opinion on that tangent.",1286855983

1782251,comment,1782045,1782115,0,0,davisp,,,"Let me preference this as I'm not a Java guy, but I've been reading a bit since Oracle filed suit because of the ASF angle.<p>From what I understand, the Apache Harmony project was doing a clean room implementation of the Java standard library. There was a clause somewhere (I haven't researched the exact text of this) that said something along the lines of ""You must pass the TCK (Java's language test suite sort of like rubyspec <a href=""http://rubyspec.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rubyspec.org/</a>) to be a 'compatible implmentation',"" or some such.<p>Apache Harmony people started writing code and when it got time to say, ""Ok, can we have the TCK to validate this?"" Sun said, ""Yes, as long as you promise no one will run your shit on mobile phones.""<p>If you know the ASF, this sort of thing is wildly against their core mission: to make unencumbered software. So they gave Sun-Now-Oracle the finger.<p>Now, we need to cover a few bases here. Apache Harmony is not a VM, its an implementation of the standard library. The patent issues Oracle sued over were related to the Dalvik VM. The important point here is that the Dalvik VM is <i>not</i> Java. Its an interpreter for byte code. The byte code that runs on Dalvik will not run on any other VM. People think that Android Java is Java, but its not. Android Java is Java that's been compiled to JVM bytecode and then been translated to Dalvik bytecode (again, IIUC).<p>The basic point is that 'The Java Language' is not a JVM. It is not a standard library. But there's some weird ass 'Certified Java' thing that can't be obtained unless you give up rights, even though Java is open source.<p>My reading of this IBM/Oracle tryst is that IBM decided that it could get a ""TCK certified"" Java implementation by backing OpenJava.<p>Which is a long way of saying, no, Google/Apache probably can't just create a new Java spec. The JCP et al will prevent such things. Perhaps they could fork and make a RangerRick language that was source level compatible, but something tells me these people employ too many lawyers for that to go over well.",1286855416

1782243,comment,1780567,1782201,0,0,dnautics,,,">Deflation increases the value of my debt load putting me in deeper and deeper and reduces the value of my assets; how is that good? Deflation increases the value of saved cash. If anything, that sounds way worse for the poor than slight inflation. If I'm rich I just keep all my wealth in cash and steal from the poor via deflation.<p>The value of your assets is untouched, the value of your assets relative to money goes down.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Who told you to go into debt in the first place?  Islamic Finance, for example, doesn't allow for interest bearing fractional reserve debt, and Indonesia largely rode out the most recent economic crisis?  I think with modest deflation, borrowing will not cease, but will largely be confined to collateral-backed loans (like car and home loans) and investment loans (like a loan to start out a second restaurant where the first succeeded).  Revolving debt will disappear, and I don't really have much of a problem with that.<p>I'm also unclear as to how deflation steals from the poor.  If I am rich, and spending 20% of my income on day to day expenses, and there's 10% deflation, I will be spending 18% of my funds on day to day.  That's a 2.5% increase in discretionary spending/investing power (80%-82%).  If I'm poor, and spending 90% of my income on day-to-day expenses and there's 10% deflation, I will then be spending 81% of my income on day to day expenses.  That is a 90% increase in my discretionary spending/investing power (10%-19%).  Sounds to me like a good deal for the poor.<p>> Under continual inflation, I can't do that, I have to convert my wealth into hopefully appreciating assets-and I could easily bet wrong-and the poor have continually decreasing debt as long salaries keep up with inflation. Sounds like a better deal to me.<p>1) any situation where you feel like ""have"" to do something is generally a red flag, if you ask me.<p>2) Who told the poor to go into debt in the first place?  Under continual inflation, you encourage financiers to seek out more and more predatory loans (so they can make money off of the delta-interest and exert the strong arm of the law against the poor to wring the last of their money out).  In a deflationary environment, instead of having to borrow money, from ever more-centralized banks, and when people get in trouble you will see them seek help from decentralized, local, institutions, like families, churches, charities, and mutual aid societies.  This naturally limits the spread of risk.  In a debt-based society, a catastrophe (like say, katrina, or say a meteor hits NYC) ripples throughout the debt network, as the victims are unable to repay their immediate lenders, whose power to pay back their lenders also gets hurt, and so on like dominoes.  In a savings based society, the damage done by a catastrophe is largely a sunk cost.<p>3) I went over the mathematics of how the endebted poor are not helped by inflation many, many, posts up.  The gist of it is the erosion of amortization power far far outstrips any benefit gained from loss of real debt value...  And the reason for it is:<p>>as long salaries keep up with inflation<p>They don't.<p>>You assert that, but I don't see any proof or evidence of it.<p>Well, the two mechanisms of inflation are printing money (which sends money to the politically connected) and debt expansion (by lowering fed rates or by loosening reserve requirements) which sends money to the financiers, or rich people.<p>That's my point.  It's not the naturalness of deflation that makes it good, but the fact that inflation is a policy choice with bad results that makes inflation bad.  It is possible to have natural, secular inflation, if population expands faster than technology can accomodate feeding mouths and housing the new people - and I'm more neutral on that situation.<p>But a side effect of secular, natural, deflation is that we live in a savings-based society, which is more stable.  I consider this to be good.  There will also be a natural redistribution of wealth to the poor.  I consider this to be fine.  Artificial deflation can be catastrophic, and even kleptocratic, as happened just prior to the great depression as well as in argentina during the 70s.<p>If you can't see why deflation is 'natural' consider any technology where government has not instituted price controls.  You would be hard pressed to argue that there hasn't been ""price deflation"" - a phrase I cringe to use because it's a malignment of the concept - in computers, TVs, cars, voluntary medical procedures like lasik or breast implantation...",1286855038

Both the above article and the blurb for subscribers are written with lots of PR-ese.<p>--<p>Coming soon! eMusic’s largest catalog addition ever along with a new way to price music<p>eMusic’s mission has always been to provide our members with a deep and broad selection of music at the best possible value. So we’re thrilled to announce that this November we will be adding more than 250,000 tracks to eMusic!<p>The additions include classic hip-hop albums on the Def Jam label; groundbreaking, forward-thinking rock music on Geffen and Interscope; giants of jazz on the Verve and ECM labels; a wealth of classical music from the standard bearers Deutsche Grammophon and Decca Records; hard-hitting alt-country on Lost Highway; timeless R&B from the Motown label, and much, much more! It will be the single largest catalog addition to eMusic by far, and it comes thanks to a recent agreement with Universal Music Group.<p>In order to continue to grow our catalog and to insure a sustainable business in the long term, we need more flexible pricing. So we are changing from today’s credit-per-track system to currency pricing. Your membership will continue just as it is today and your monthly payments will not change. But starting in November, you’ll see tracks and albums priced in dollars and cents instead of credits.<p>New pricing in a nutshell<p>Under the new currency pricing system, eMusic members will enjoy savings of 20%-50% compared to iTunes a la carte prices. The majority of albums on eMusic will be priced from $5.19 - $8.99. Single track pricing for members will vary as follows:\n$0.49 for most tracks currently in our catalog\n$0.69 - $0.79 for more popular content\n$0.89 for tracks that generally sell for $1.29 at iTunes\nWe won’t know where specific titles (or exactly how many) will fall in the categories above until November. But we think you’ll find that eMusic still offers the best deal out there on a consistent basis. For more on pricing, read The new pricing in detail.<p>Your monthly loyalty bonus<p>To thank you for being an eMusic member, a special loyalty bonus will be added to your account each month. The bonus level depends on the plan you are in. For more details regarding your new membership plan see the Your Plan info on the right.<p>eMusic today, eMusic tomorrow<p>We want to assure you that the heart of eMusic is not changing. As we grow our catalog, we’ll continue to profile records we find interesting or important, regardless of whether they've sold 4 or 4 million copies.<p>By growing our catalog our aim is to also grow our member base, which in turn will help fund improvements to the service. See A look at the future of eMusic for details on some of the good things to come.<p>Read on to get more details about the new catalog, the new pricing and how this affects your account.

Firstly it would demonstrate to the courts that Dalvik is not specifically a Java VM.

Having Google actually abandon Java on Android due to legal concerns would be a huge blow to Java.   Especially if Google did so in a way that enabled existing Java applications to be ported easily (by adopting the Apache Harmony libraries, utilizing their existing dexer to enable people to run their existing Java code while picking up Google's replacement language for new code).   They'd have to work around any patent violations in the VM which might have some performance impact but I'd still assume it is possible.<p>It would basically change the game to a lose-lose proposition for Oracle - win the court case, get some money, but lose Java.

It used to be ""we understand, and offer the best pricing around"". It was so relaxing to know that $50/month would get you up to 500 customers, with 49 of them being at no charge (even 10-15 at no charge would be great).

We did both sales and tech support. It was a very busy job with high call volumes, lots of shift work and the shortest legally required break times. Coincidentally enough, I also had a long commute to this job, though it was < 2 hours. After about three months I found a new position working in web design/development which was more like what I was wanting to do. This was lucky because shortly after I left, the local ISP was sold and everyone was told they could relocate across the country or lose their job.<p>I learned a lot from working help desk and don't regret doing the job at all, if nothing else, it was good to have something other than study on my resume.
