1793799,comment,1789353,1792793,0,0,levid,,,"Thank you, there is definitely a huge market for this type of an app and I like where you are headed as well. My initial thoughts were to build in a simple mode that would allow anyone to play an APA style match with their friend; and based on the statistics gathered from the match the app would be able to determine an accurate rating for them. It would then let them know if they joined the APA today, this is what they might be ranked based on their performance in the match for fun. This would follow up with a link or short form to submit their name, email and phone number to be contacted by their local APA league rep. This simple mode would allow anyone outside of the APA to benefit from the app and see what it might be like to play using the league rules and format.<p>Simple apps are definitely effective as well, and would take considerably less time to build compared something like what we are making. A good friend suggested making a basics ""drills"" app for players who are looking for tools to improve their game. It would have a simple daily practice routine built in, and allow them to easily keep track of their progress and show them an ongoing statistical analysis for each day they use it. Then over an extended period of time it would be able to pinpoint exactly what aspect(s) of their game need work and offer suggestions on other possible drills to practice (specifically to fix that issue). Your thoughts?",1287121873

On a PC, you are pretty safe assuming say, a minimum resolution of 800x600, 1024x768 [1], and generally software can just move autoresize to shift UI widgets to make use of additional space.<p>On the other hand, for mobile devices, with resolution of say 320x480 (iPhone/iPod touch) vs. 1024x768, you need to be much more specific with the UI to make efficient use of the space. E.g you find that good apps running on the iPhone often have different looking counterparts on the iPad.<p>Add to it things like certain devices having touchscreens, vs. non-touchscreens for Android which affects the entire UI and even nature of the software, it makes handling such variations much more difficult than for the PC market.<p>[1] Unless you are writing software for very specific purposes that need to utilize the whole screen efficiently, then we are back to the same problem.",1287121856
