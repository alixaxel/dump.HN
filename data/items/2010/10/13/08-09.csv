But, if I only have space for 50 people, and 50 ""leechers"" RSVP before I have 7 presenters, that's a problem. Sure, they could be there because they are curious and, like I mentioned, even be contributors in some way (maybe they brought 4 of their friends from their CS program or something), but at that point we don't have a show.<p>Maybe the term ""leecher"" isn't a good fit for what I'm talking about, but that's the basic problem.

All in all it's probably about 5 hours a month, in addition to about an hour total for setup and teardown the day of the event.<p>But, this of course would be a hell of a lot more stressful and time consuming if I had to beg for a place to host it that can hold 40-50 people, and find sponsors to get drinks and things.<p>Also, I can't imagine how much harder it would be if I wasn't using Meetup. Now, I work there, so you might think ""Oh, he's just promoting his product"" but, it has been instrumental in my success so far. It's worked well for promotion (there are emails that go out for topic alert lists, and we're often a ""trending"" meetup due to RSVP patterns), as well as member management, and communication. I ask people to talk about what they'd like to present as part of the RSVP process, for instance. And, if we needed to pay for a venue, or food, or something else, charging people $5 to RSVP is dirt simple to do and collect, manage etc from Meetup. (Sorry for the shameless promotion, but as an organizer, it really does work)<p>That said, there are certainly successful groups in NYC that have a standing meetup once a month, that aren't run via Meetup--just Google Groups, so it's certainly possible to do. It depends on the group who you're attracting, etc.",1286959934

I've talked about ideas in the past and had people ask me about investment. The way I value that is if I am going to work the next five years at startup levels of stress and hours I value my income at US$200,000 a year. So five years (commitment I would assess putting into it) x 200K is $1,000,000. Then it is up the investor as to what percentage they are after. So 10% means I would want them to invest around $100K.<p>That all needs to be balanced by your level of experience, financial expectations, how much you need the money - and how likely you perceive the potential to accept the concept.",1286959760

1786560,comment,1784078,1785831,0,0,xentronium,,,"Good point.<p>Well, let's do some projection on the IT, because I think it's somewhat better known for most of us here.<p>How many good women programmers do you know? Do you remember them because they're exceptionally good or because they're women? If you believe my statement that they're ""dramatically underrepresented in IT"" (if you don't, I'll have to bring in some statistics like [1]), is it because they're:<p><pre><code>    a) less suitable for IT jobs (for whatever reason)\n    b) don't tend to like IT \n    c) b) because of a)\n    d) a) because of b)\n    e) strongly abused at IT work [2]\n    f) not their fault, employer's\n</code></pre>\nGiven that I don't believe that IT guys are aggressive towards women, I am left with five options. f) is probable but I thought USA was an example of sex tolerance and stuff. So I am left with statements a) to d) with d) being my argument of choice.<p>There was an interesting insight on the subject of gender differences in [3] and some not-statistically-worthy-but-probably-scientifically-correct proof of the fact that women's brains are wired differently than men's.<p>Now back to military, cooking and teaching. There is a reason why women were ""dramatically underrepresented"" in military in Paleolithic era. If you pick most animal communities the male species are generally the defenders, the warriors, the aggressors. I believe that to be hard-wired to the brain. I admit that point about endurance is probably not valid, my bad, but women still can't run kilometers with full equipment on them. There was another point with totally anecdotal evidence: women-only teams work worse than men-only teams in my experience. Is it because males tend to be ultra-competitive and better team players? I think so.<p>Teaching. Now don't get me wrong, I admit that mothers have really great positive impact on their children, but I also think that in school and universities the teachers should be mostly men, at least for the ""male audience"". Boys need an authority, an example, a leader.<p>Cooking. I guess that's most controversial of three, because there shouldn't be any hard prerequisites for chef that women cannot meet. Yet they're ""dramatically underrepresented"" for one reason or other.<p>This is a long comment already, but the core idea is that in a good company you shouldn't be afraid to express your opinion, even if it doesn't have some fundamental research base behind it. There's nothing wrong in being wrong. It's wrong to be wrong and not admit it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Csbachelors.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Csbachelors.jp...</a> -- data is somewhat old but it shows the proportion.

If $1.5MM isn't enough for you, you're nailing your own coffin shut.  You will never exceed that limit unless there is a sudden influx in businesses to the niche or you drastically change your product - neither are very feasible or ideal situations.<p>I read somewhere that you should set your price as high as you can without breaking out in laughter.  Almost a ludicrous concept at first glance, but ponder this: to your market, that ridiculously high price might be actually seem ridiculously low for the value that your product adds to their business.<p>So instead of $25/mo, price your product st $250/mo.  If your market sees the value in your product, it will sell - and your $1.5MM cap becomes $15MM instantaneously.  If your market doesn't see the value in the product, adjust pricing accordingly so that the price matches the value.  After all, it is relatively easy to lower prices, but nearly impossible to raise them.<p>Final thought - consider perceived value.  The price itself speaks value to some.  A low price might say ""We are new to the business and don't really know what we're doing.  The biggest benefit we offer is that we are less expensive than your current solution, but we might not be able to offer you the best service in the world."" A high price might say ""We're serious and we're here to stay.  Though we not be the cheapest solution, our service vastly exceeds that of our competitors, ultimately improving your business.""",1286958019

1786505,comment,1786130,1786444,0,0,loewenskind,,,"No, this is completely wrong.  Filing has nothing to do with ""having some financial ties with the US"", it has to do with <i>being a US citizen</i>.  You are double taxes with some extra write-offs [1].  The 10 year thing comes if you <i>give up your citizenship</i> for tax purposes (if you have over $2million in <i>assets</i> this is automatically assumed).  In that case you are taxed at a higher rate for 10 years before finally getting off the hook.  If you give up your citizen for other reasons then you only have to file for one additional year.<p>Oh yea, if you have $10k at any moment in the course of the year you must report all bank accounts where the money was (i.e. 3k in one account, 5k in another, 2k in a third, report all 3).  You wont hear about this rule unless you live in a so-called ""tax haven"".  Guess why that is.<p>[1]  This is very complex.  For a single earner you can take an exemption on the first ~$80k.  In most of the US that's a lot of money.  Not necessarily everywhere, so depending on where you live you may hit this pretty fast.  Taking the exemption makes you unable to claim certain things so you can also chose not to take the exception and use a more complex form.  I have a tax guy do this for me (takes him over 3 hours to go through the paper work) and costs about $1k/year.",1286957828
