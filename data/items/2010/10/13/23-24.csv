You'll find it easily on Weezic with all the ressources you need to enjoy playing it: Scores, Customizable accompaniment files in high mp3 quality and other musicians to share it with"".<p>I hope this answers your questions about the offer.<p>Regarding the business model, people will have to pay to access our content (scores + accompaniments, etc.) but the user-generated part will be free of course.<p>If you're interested in the project you can contact me at: nicolas@weezic.com\nIf you're in Paris, why not have a beer and discuss it in more details.
