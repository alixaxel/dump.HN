With this in mind...<p>s/accomodating/accommodating/<p>I hope no offense is taken. ;)<p>And now, the more important stuff...<p>As you know, the terms often control the discussion, so kudos for your notes listing the various terms, i.e. ""Super Angels"" ""Mini-VCs"" and ""Micro-VCs."" Some have balked at the use of the adjective/term ""super"" as misleading, but the terms typically used, and their corresponding definitions don't have distinct lines. A potential resolution might be using the term ""archangel"" for the investments/investors beyond the typical ""angel"" round? Anyone fluent enough in English to know the term ""archangel"" will understand the implication of it being greater than ""angel."" --It's just a thought.<p>Another thought would be to break down the classifications by their most defining aspect, namely amount of capital. The lines will still be imperfect, and you have a better grasp of the numbers than I do, but the language would be generally more clear. I was thinking something like this:<p>seed: < 30,000<p>angel: 30,000 - 150,000<p>archangel: 150,000 - 1,000,000<p>vc: > 1,000,000<p>That would classify YC pretty much as you describe it, namely, as a ""seed fund,"" or better said, specializing in ""seed round funding.""
