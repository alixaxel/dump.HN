1835805,comment,1833989,1835047,0,0,imurray,,,"Thanks. Below is the version I'm trying. It allows multiple-argument commands, doesn't stomp on atchange if inotifywait isn't installed and I wanted it to fire when touching files as well as modifying them.<p><pre><code>  if which inotifywait > /dev/null ; then\n      function atchange(){\n          FILE=""$1""\n          shift\n          while inotifywait -qq -e modify -e attrib ""$FILE""; do\n              ""$@"";\n      done;}\n  fi\n</code></pre>\nLooking again at atchange it deliberately waits after first noticing the file has been modified, in case something is still modifying it. It fires once writing has stopped for at least a second. I'm not sure if I need that in my use cases, but its authors clearly did so I'm pointing out that the above shell function does not provide a true like-for-like replacement. (Also atchange allows a single argument to be a command_file, functionality I never use.)<p>EDIT changed the ""while true"" so that the function stops on an error rather than infinitely looping when something goes wrong, like FILE ceasing to exist. A file temporarily disappearing would scupper the script though, whereas the perl script deals quietly with that.",1288123123

OSX and various Linux desktops are organized in the same way: you <i>can</i> put application shortcuts on the desktop, but the desktop is better for documents.<p>Why did this happen? A)Even for non-tech-savvy people, the idea of a ""file"" makes perfect sense if you think about a document, B)Someone realized that opening a document in an application made for that kind of document should be a first class action, and shouldn't necessarily require you to first open the application and then use the application to open the document, and C)When you start putting documents on a desktop, putting ""applications"" alongside them using the same visual representation (a clickable icon) can be confusing. The result was a more literal ""desktop,"" complete with your click-to-open documents laying around. Tools (applications) were put away in the desk drawers, so to speak.<p>The widespread usage of iOS has put apps front and center again, both figuratively and literally - users have again become accustomed to seeing grids of icons for their applications instead of their documents.

One, it was coarsely ground which is in direct contrast to the majority of flours that we currently consume.  Whole grains are in general better than overly processed grains if you're going to eat grains.  That being said, the evidence for our ancestors eating cattail flour comes in around 30,000 years ago.  The Paleolithic period goes back 2.5 million years and the evolutionary history of our digestive habits is largely without any grains.  Just because we have been eating grains for 30,000 years does not mean that's what we ate throughout the majority of our evolutionary history.<p>I'm not a nutritionist but I do eat a predominantly lacto paleo diet and the changes in my body fat, sleep habits and energy levels have been extraordinary.  Anecdotal?  Yup but it can't hurt to give it a try.  That's usually my advice on the paleo diet.  Far from being a fad diet, it's much more like a lifestyle change that seems to make sense in my experience.",1288121350

No good products will be on the shelf because someone with the path to market owns the shelf space.<p>The market you are trying to enter will be next to impossible to penetrate without contacts. A big distributor of light switches won't buy from you because 1) they don't want to pay anyone but themselves, 2) will only do business with big companies, 3) and so on. The same goes for the light switch manufacturers.<p>The only way they will buy from you is if you can show them a completed product that looks exactly like it will on the shelf, in the exact packaging that they will sell it at. Even with all that, chances are less than slim.<p>Friends often ask me ways to get into home automation, which is a similar field to what you want to do. My suggestions is always this: Get in with a local builder. Supply your switches to him to put into his new homes. Develop relationships with growing amounts of builders, hit the shows, etc. Once you start affecting the market with your sales, then the big companies will talk to you. Until then, status quo is serving them pretty well.<p>Regarding provisional patents, I am not an attorney, so you will need to talk with someone knowledgeable in the legal field for that one. Be conscious of first sale doctrine and other things that will invalidate later patent claims.<p>What my company does is make our products into reality. We see a market, target it with a new product, and then shop it to the large manufacturers and distributors. They put their name on it and everyone gets money.<p>The reason why we don't do it ourselves is that we make more money working with them. The people we sell to own shelf space and end caps at Walmart, Target, etc. We aren't getting in those stores without our partners. Other partners have distribution arrangements to specialty store markets. Others are large purchasers of TV ads. We work with all these people to get our products to market.<p>There isn't secret sauce in our products. We make new stuff, cheaper and faster than others, and that is why our products get on the shelf. But without our distribution partner relationships gained from many years in the industry, we would have no path to market and would not make that many sales.",1288121161

They raise enough revenue to do significantly more than they have (whether, politically, they would ever be allowed/enabled/encouraged to, is another matter).  But Washington gathers it up and wastes (err, spends) it elsewhere. [1]<p>A few years ago, there was a lot of hoopla and excitement over the SEC's ""receiving"" additional funding for 100 more attorneys to prosecute investigations and regulatory proceedings (100, IIRC).  Last I checked (earlier this year), SEC management was still ""optimistic"" that that additional funding would soon be showing up.  (My resulting impression after that conversation was, 'yeah, RSN (Real Soon Now)'.)<p>[1]  This is off the top of my head (or out of my *ss), but I seem to recall a few years ago seeing SEC fee and whatnot revenues quoted as being in the $600 million range, while their annual budget was set at around $100 - $110 million.
