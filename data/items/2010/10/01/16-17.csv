The difference between a good teacher and an ok one is dramatic, so this is worth exploring. (Who's ""good"" may vary from student to student, of course.) I've also noticed that some of the teachers tend to be more doctrinaire than others. I avoid the latter, but YMMV.<p>If you give it a try, I'd be curious to hear your assessment. The Alexander work is one of very few practices I use every day -- ""use"" isn't the right word; it's integrated into my habits -- and I have reaped rich rewards from it. To pick a simple example, I've gone on many long motorcycle trips over the years. Typically once I'd been riding for a day or two pain management would become an integral part of the trip. The last trip I did I was astonished at not having that problem any more; I'm pretty sure the AT stuff was the reason.",1285952347

No one disagrees that Mint's branding is great. But to count that as the main reason why they won? Even top 3-5 reasons? That flies in the face of the wisdom given by <i>every</i> successful startup veteran: <i>it's all about execution.</i> If Mint.com hadn't provided the instant gratification that got people talking, if they hadn't won TC50, if they hadn't spent heaps of money on marketing, they would have been dead in the water.<p>Don't get me wrong: branding is important. But if your product+marketing is inferior, you'll probably lose, and if it's superior, you'll overcome all but the most disastrous names. (Nobody knew what a googol was, most people still don't, and look who's running the show.) You're focusing on the name to such an extent that you're ignoring most of the factors that lead a business to success or death... it's like MBA guys who've never built a product in their lives, yet say things like, ""Oh I'll just outsource it, it's not important.""

It's not a mystery, really, especially for anyone who is involved.<p>TL;TR: it's expensive because ""medical professionals"" are greedy: they do unnecessary procedures, hire and keep unnecessary bloated staff and, of course, they overcharge for everything. The probability of you being diagnosed with X goes up as the number of doctors specializing in X in your area increases (listen the podcast for source), that's because the assholes just can't stomach saying ""there is nothing wrong with you"" and letting profits fall. Besides, you can simply look around: there is no reason for doctors to be millionaires and drug sales reps to own aircraft. The system is expensive because capitalism in healthcare is nonsense: you get greedy assholes milking ""customers"" who are unconscious, scared or in pain.<p>What's annoying is that doctors enjoy the unexplained immunity from public anger. It's always the ""evil"" insurance companies and ""big pharma"", or government regulators, who are to blame, while its not uncommon for American doctors  to make million+ dollars a year delivering results that are no better of their French counterparts. I invite you to a typical cancer clinic in the US, you'll face devastated people who are dying, and who are getting ass-raped by <i>handreds of thousands of dollars</i> of medical bills <i>on top of having an insurance</i>. Those poor folks are sitting in lavish doctor's offices furnished with the most expensive hardwood flooring money can buy, surrounded by mind blowing numbers of ""support staff"" who have nothing to do with medicine, yet they too need to get paid. For <i>anyone</i> who's ever been to one, question of <i>""why our heathcare so expensive""</i> has an obvious, straight, screaming in your face  answer.<p>My personal solution is radical, simple and effective: ban  drug commercials, introduce fixed salaries for doctors, and if someone's unhappy - GTFO, plus open visas for Indian/French/Canadian doctors who'll be more than happy to take their place. Yes, government is grossly inefficient, I know, but NOTHING can be worse that this mess we're in. The amount of money extorted from the public by ""medical professionals"" is just insane. I've worked for a semi-military contractor that was selling to the government, wasn't rosy, but not nearly as outrageous that this quasi-market monster of a healthcare we have.",1285951339

This is an excellent thing to be good at - 99.9% of all medium and large design projects require application development and planning.<p>If I'm right, you should monopolize on this niche.  There are a good number of artistic designers who don't know very much about code.  If you develop some examples (aka a portfolio) you could be the ""go to guy"" whenever any number of large artistic shops needs to integrate or develop an app into their frontend design.<p>If there are a lot of small businesses in your geographic area who require web design (it doesn't sound like there are), I think that you should either rely on web site templates or subcontracting template design from artsy frontend folks.  What you're doing now is a disservice to your own body of work.",1285950586

1747456,comment,1747202,1747202,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I did a lot of looking into this. Here's some points pasted in from an old comment of mine that was popular -<p>--<p>Some reasons American medicine is very expensive:<p>1. Health insurance, but not treatment, is fully tax deductible. So if you buy your own penicillin, it's with after tax money, but if your insurance company buys it, it's pre-tax money. That's one of the reasons that health insurance is so widespred in America even for routine medicine like antibiotics and checkups. That's a major contributing factor in why the administrative costs are so high.<p>2. There's a shortage of doctors in America, and qualified doctors from other countries are not allowed to practice medicine in the United States. So there's good doctors from Canada, England, Japan, wherever that'd love to practice in the USA, but can't. This artificially inflates doctor's wages by restricting supply.<p>3. American doctors are typically required to get an undergraduate degree, medical degree, and do a below market, crazy hours residency in order to be able to practice medicine. That's 8-10 years of study and below market working to practice medicine. Now, medicine is very important and needs to be done right, but I don't believe for a second that a focused apprenceship couldn't teach a very specific kind of medicine - say arithscopic surgery - in just 2-4 years under a highly trained doctor, but this isn't an option.<p>4. The Food and Drug Administration requires new drugs to be proven not only for safety, but also efficacy. That's an incredibly high and expensive burden to meet - that means that drugs need to be proven to work to a certain standard, instead of just not harm. This adds years of development time and millions of dollars in cost to the new drug development cycle.<p>Those are all legislated reasons that increase the cost of medical insurance, doctors, and drugs. They'd be fairly easy to remove -<p>1. All medical and health expenses can be written off taxes regardless of insurance. Employees can choose to convert som of their wages to a medical or health plan tax free to both the employer and employee. (Currently, under most circumstances, only employer-provided health insurance can is tax free)<p>2. Allow any doctor in a country with reasonably competent medical standards to practice in the United States.<p>3. Require that doctors be able to demonstrate that they can practice their area of medicine capably. Be flexible in how they demonstrate that. Note: This will incur high opposition from medical schools and current doctors who are currently enjoying the wage premium and had to go through the very long, difficult, and expensive system.<p>4. Change the drug standard from ""safety and efficacy"" to only safety. Drugs will come to market much faster and cheaper. There's plenty of people and organizations that will test proven safe drugs for efficacy for free or nominal cost once drugs hit market, and efficacy will get understood with time. Put this way - a proven safe but questionably effective treatment against heart disease being held off the market for five years and costing much more to get to market is not a good thing. If it's certainly safe, then let people make the decisions with their physicians, instead of having the FDA take such a strong gatekeeping stance.<p>Technology has progressed such that we don't need government protection from ourselves as much any more. The current set of legislation has greatly increased the costs of doctors and medicine. Regardless of political position, and regardless of stance on other health issues, addressing these four points will make the medical system fairer, more effective, and and less expensive with relative ease.<p>Admittedly, there's some powerful entrenched interests that are winning in the current arrangement, and will oppose these simple improvements.",1285949223
