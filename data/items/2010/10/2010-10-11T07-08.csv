Probably even more than tens of millions, more like reaching towards 9 figures, if not mid 8 figures. I think that really invalidates the author's point about supposedly wealthy people being frugal, buying habits of non-millionaires aside....",1286783943

If your partner is doing more harm than good in certain aspects, why not agree that you need to formalise those aspects to accelerate growth, and then do it in a way that actually helps him not screw up?<p>For example: you say your website is a mess. If he can make it ugly, then he has too much control. Move to a CMS with a tight templating system and eliminate this pain point. If he's making repeat (and poor) feature requests, move to a formal feature request system with upvoting and make it public. Then you can point out that a particular feature has no user support. If you're answering the same questions over and over, institute an internal helpdesk system and just refer him to the answered, closed tickets and the search when he re-asks.<p>Basically, look at it as a management issue. The human factor is always going to be an issue no matter what startup you pursue; if you lack the soft skills to deal with it well, a systems approach might take you 80% of where you need to go until you've expanded enough to bring in another person who's designated job it is to take responsibility for these decisions.",1286783312

The shear magnitude of earth moving is unbelievable.<p>Hear is an interesting fact I am sure will surprise most:
<i>Most gold mines have ore grades of about 5-7g/Tonne</i>.<p>That is 5g of gold for every 1 tonne of rock pulled out of the ground. Doesnt sound like much, but when a CAT 793C dumptruck is loaded with about 250T and the current gold price is as high as it is, you will see why even at 5g/Tonnes it is VERY profitable.<p>Mining is all about efficiency, and optimising how much ore comes out of the ground. If you can get just 1 more dump truck per day, at today's gold price that equates to about $18million in revenue per year.<p>If any entrepreneurs are looking for a market full of money, check out the gold miners. ;)<p>edit: formatting.",1286782490

That way, the sweetner is that if I am accepted, and it so happens that the w11 rounds are anything like S10 (i.e. largely convertible notes), then it works out better for them then because they would be converting to equity while the later stage investors are just getting their notes.<p>I was trying to avoid running up large legal bills, for the amount considered.<p>The investor can be considered 'friends and family'. I was thinking that maybe we do up a general agreement on some terms - i.e. everything that a 'standard convertible note' would have with a few tweaks. Then if I am accepted into YC, I then formalize it then - with the documentation that you guys have.<p>Would that suffice, or would you still want me to do everything with an attorney first?<p>As an aside, I am not in the US - so doing the official legal documentation and incorporating up there might be more tricky, if I were to do everything on my own (which is why I was thinking of a general agreement with acceptable terms on both sides - with specifics to be hashed out later upon incorporation).",1286782481

1779074,comment,1777553,1777936,0,0,zootar,,,"Most advocates of saving that I’ve seen in mainstream media are interested foremost in personal finance, not anti-consumerism.  To them, the problem isn't that people enjoy spending money.  On the contrary, they want to help people spend their money in a way that maximizes the amount of enjoyment derived.   Writers like Stanley know that spending a lot of money early in your working life is rarely a way to maximize enjoyment.<p>What a lot of people don’t realise is that “short-term pleasures” cost a lot more when you’re older.  In your 20s and 30s, you don’t need much more than a computer and a bicycle to be perfectly content.  You have lots of energy to work, study, take cheap outdoorsy vacations, and cut your own lawn.  But at some point, you start to find those things significantly more wearisome.  That’s when it’s really nice to have the financial freedom to quit your job, eat in good restaurants, and outsource all of your home maintenance.  By far the majority of people won’t achieve that level of financial freedom unless they defer a large proportion of their income from the first half of their career to the second half and to retirement.<p>Evidently, many people must overcome significant psychological obstacles to save their money.  That’s why there are so many personal finance books trying to explain the same idea in different ways.  Some emphasize the time value of money.  Others, how expenses tend to increase over one’s lifetime.  Stanley tries to reduce the urge to spend by showing that many big spenders are not actually rich or financially secure.  The success of “The Millionaire Next Door” seems to be evidence that a lot of people find this approach helpful.",1286782411
