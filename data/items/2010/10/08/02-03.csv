1770385,story,,,4,9,lsc,"Ask HN: How do I manage equity and dilution in a lifestyle business?",,"I think the way it works in most startups is that you agree to an equity\nsplit, and if one founder leaves, the company dies or you buy him\nout and that's that.<p>The thing is, I run a lifestyle business.  I've pretty much poured\nall my resources for the last five years into the thing.  I'm fairly\ndedicated;  I'm not saying I'd never give up, but I think I've already\ngone beyond what could be expected of any right thinking person.<p>Things are going fairly well now;  I mean, it is a growing market\nsegment with lots of investor interest, and I seem to have developed\nsomething of a reputation.  I've got an office and an employee\nnow (not a misclassified contractor;  I'm doing it right.) and\nI've got far more customer demand than I can meet at the moment.\nI mean, it's not a big business, by any means;  but it's more than\na hobby and there's a chance it will become something that will\nreturn significantly more than what a bay area sysadmin can get.<p>If you can read my tone above, I have very strong feelings of\npride and ownership.   I feel pretty uncomfortable cutting in\nsomeone on ownership who will likely leave the company long before\nI will.   The problem with simply buying people out as they leave\nis that if I had the cash, I'd pay them in cash to begin with\nrather than screwing with equity.<p>Up until now, I've just been paying people cash.  This has necessitated\na policy of finding people with potential who are new and training,\nor finding people who are undervalued by the market for other reasons.\nIt has worked out fairly well for me;  I like training, and I think\nI'm pretty good at spotting people with potential.  The crappy economy\nmeans that lately I've been able to keep people longer than they normally\nstick around.<p>The thing of it is, I know some people who are very good\nwho make fairly good money on the open market who are interested\nin working for me.  I'm certain that hiring these people could\nmake my company much stronger, but the kind of cash I can offer is\njust not going to cut it, not without a pretty good shot of equity.<p>Take, for example, a hypothetical person I want to hire who is\nworth $130K in salary and benefits on the open market (around here,\nthat's a competent programmer, but nothing unusual.)  Say I can afford\nto pay $30K a year so they can cover rent;  After a year, I've\ngot a $100K shortfall.   Assuming my company was only worth $200K\n(my company is worth more, but not a lot more.  ISPs go foraround a years revenue plus value of any hardware, so we're not\ntalking emerging social network level price to earnings ratios.)\nif I was to be fair, I'd give that person half the company.<p>Now, I understand that most startups won't give an employee\nmore than 5%, no matter how little the company is worth or how\nmuch the employee is worth... I don't think that 5% of a $200K\ncompany plus thirty grand is going to get me a years work from\na $130K person.   This whole thought experiment is an experiment\nin being fair, and 5% is obviously not fair in that case.<p>If I give someone half the equity and the company grows at a\nrealistic (rather than an explosive) rate,  unless they are as\nexcited as staying on and working for free as I am (and I don't expect\nthat from a rational person.)  it's pretty much over.  I have a\nchoice between continuing to work for free on the startup, with\nall the downsides of working for someone else and none of the upside,\nand getting a real job with an immediate 400% pay raise.<p>Now, if growth exploded, that'd be fine.  we'd all be happy\nand rich.   The problem is, what if we only boost the company\nby another $100K?   I'm now stuck with half of a $300K company;\n$50K poorer than I was last year, and now to move my own personal\nnet worth by a buck, I've gotta make the company $2 more valuable.<p>User maxawaytoolong pretty much sums it up for me:<p>""You just described how most startups end up. Even yc funded\nstartups that flop have to close up shop and the founders go\nback to work at Facebook or whatever. There aren't any easy\nanswers to your questions.""<p>the thing is, in the likely case of a reasonable growth curve, I\nwant the option of not shutting down.<p>There is precedent for this;  I know several funded but unprofitable\nstartups that have been funded and unprofitable for years.  They\nkeep going back for more funding, and because they have a very\ncompelling product, they get that funding.<p>Now, each time they go out for another round of funding, their\nold investors are diluted by the new shares created to sell to\nnew investors.   Old investors let this happen because otherwise\nthe company would just die, and it's better to have a smaller part\nof something than a larger part of nothing, and the newer investors,\nwell, they feel that just maybe, the company will take off without\nneeding another round.<p>What if I could apply this same process to people who invest labor\nrather than dollars?<p>My thought is that every 6-12 months or so, we simulate another round\nof funding.   First, we'd figure the difference between market rate\nand what people actually got paid (I'm pretty sure I could do this\nwith anyone I'd be willing to work with... if it was a problem, we\ncould agree on those figures at the beginning of the term.)<p>We dilute all current stock by the amount of additional money we'd need to\npay everyone market rate, and distribute the new shares based on the\ndifference between a person's market value and the cash they actually\ngot paid.  (Obviously, we'd need to agree on 'market rate' and a formula\nfor calculating the value of the company ahead of time, but I think\nthese are small things.)<p>This would mean that every six months, anyone who was not working would\nget diluted a little bit more.",1286506073

Locality may not be what you want.<p>For example, last I heard google's search index was sharded by document rather than by term.<p>That sounds odd, since if it was sharded by term, then a given search would only need to go to a handful of servers (one for each term) and then the intermediate result combined. But with it sharded by document, every query has to go to all the nodes in each replica/cluster.<p>It ends up that's not as bad as it seems. Since everything is in ram, they can answer ""no matches"" on a given node extremely quickly (using bloom filters mostly in on processor cache or the like). They also only send back truly matching results, rather than intermediates that might be discarded later, saving cluster bandwidth. Lastly it means their search processing is independent of the cluster communication, giving them a lot of flexibility to tweak the code without structural changes to their network, etc.<p>Does that mean everyone doing search should shard the same way? Probably not. You have to design this stuff carefully and mind the details. Using any given data store is not a silver bullet.",1286504734
