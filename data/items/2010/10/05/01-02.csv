1758323,comment,1757685,1757685,0,0,nopassrecover,,,"I can only comment on my Virgin Blue (low but not cutthroat budget Australian airline) experience but I have to say that the company has completely embodied the Branson attitude as described in his books. For instance we've been an hour late to a flight (that was fortunately delayed) and not only did they let us on the plane, but they managed to let us check in an unexpected baggage item (they security cleared it of course) - I have no idea what the usual domestic American carrier is like but this rule-bending on favour of the customer and common-sense (humans at all levels to paraphrase Branson) is unheard of on other (particularly traditional) carriers where, for example, you can lose your flight without refund if you are only 25 minutes early to your flight instead of 30 minutes.<p>Some other comparison points:<p>- ""Web check-in"" allowing you to arrive anytime up to the boarding of the plane (if flying with purely carry-on luggage) instead of having to arrive an arbitrary time before departure because of inefficient passenger processing.<p>- Friendly, bouncy and joking flight staff versus off-putting and critical drones who seem put out at the slightest request.<p>- Modern aircraft with simple amenities like screens for every seat versus tired old planes from the days where lack of competition and government monopolies dominated the industry.<p>- Reasonable fares without sacrificing quality versus either dated but comparable quality at a higher price or true ""budget"" where you sacrifice both quality and patience for a price that is often pretty close after hidden fees (e.g. A fee for booking, a fee for paying and a fee for paying via credit when this is the only accepted option).",1286243944

I have zero reason not to continue this indefinitely.  I would have gone as $3/month without hitting my ""Hmm, let's think about this point"" - though I suspect I would have paid as much as $4/month before I considered not subscribing.  $5/month is over my pain point.<p>As a side note - the WSJ has basically established my ""levelling"" indicator for what I consider fair value for a subscription.  They charge me $155/12 months or about $13/month - with content syncing to my iPad or viewable through the Web Browser.<p>So, when I purchase monthly content or service subscriptions, I mentally ask my myself - what percentage of a WSJ subscription this is.

1758227,comment,1755748,1758048,0,0,Dove,,,"Thank you for that.<p>I'll admit I didn't really have ancient China or Greece in mind when I referred to the past -- I was thinking more along the lines of the past couple hundred years in the West.  You know, that same group of folks that we criticize and feel so morally superior to on account of slavery.  I mean, slavery among the Aztecs or the ancient Romans was bad, but somehow we gloss over that.  It's just a part of who they were, something they did in moral ignorance.  By contrast, we feel that 18th century Americans and Europeans <i>should</i> have known better.<p>We criticize that group for slavery, but I think they would criticize us for our practice of abortion.  The history on that page seems to match my intuition on that; abortion was illegal (for heaven's sake--it was a capital crime in the UK!) and disgraceful, though certainly practiced.   I stand by my assertion that the past would be apalled at us.  Rightly so, I think.<p>Looking toward the future, I find the diversity of recent law in many countries interesting.  But one pattern I particularly find interesting -- and perhaps I pick it out because it matches my expectation -- is the proliferation of age limits.  Legal abortion before eight weeks, ten weeks, twelve, fourteen, even twenty-four, depending on the country; illegal thereafter with exeptions for emergencies.  The younger the life in the womb, the more I think reasonable people can disagree on its status.  During the first trimester, when 20-40% of pregnancies fail anyway despite our best efforts, when the shape of the body is alien and the activity of the mind couldn't even be called sleep, the degree of tragedy in abortion is debatable.  By the third trimester, when the thresholds of viability and ability to react and interact and play and feel joy and pain have all been passed, anyone who thinks it <i>isn't</i> a baby isn't paying attention.<p>Slavery throughout history has not been a uniform phenomenon.  Sometimes it looked a lot like employment does now; sometimes it involved human sacrifice.  Even in the antebellum south, the experience was diverse; post-emancipation, there were slaves who loved their masters as family and stayed close and took their names, others who hated them with bitter and justifiable fire.  But we remember and criticize the cruelty -- the worst incarnation of slavery.  That is what we remember, that is the thing about which we say, ""How could they have let that continue for so long?""<p>So it will be with us.  As science advances and viability retreats younger and younger and we discover invisible threads of humanity in younger and younger lives, the window of reasonable disagreement will shrink.  Maybe to 20 weeks, maybe to 12, maybe to 8; I don't know.  We won't be remembered for our prompt six week abortions--that might always remain a religious question.  But the bloody affairs at seven and a half months on tenuous reasoning?<p>Barbaric.  I think future generations will ask, aghast, how we could possibly have allowed that.",1286241434

Just being there is only valuable if you're lucky and happen to meet and chat with the right person. These types of events are typically heavy on the alcohol and networking and don't make for a great environment to pitch your company. Given that, you need to do everything you can to improve your chances of meeting valuable people.<p>For example, If you're goal is to meet investors, look through the attendee list and find all of the investors that you want to talk with. Ideally you'd go to the event with someone else so that either you or that person can roam the floor looking for people that you've targetted. Give those people a small flyer or business card, mention where you're at in the room, and ask them to stop by if they have a moment.<p>If you get someone at your table that you think is valuable to your business, be short and sweet with them. Most of these people are there to drink and meet and greet. Don't trap them at your booth. Give them the quick pitch, tell them why you're unique and interesting, get their business card, and tell them you'll follow-up with them after the show for a coffee meeting.<p>If people come by your booth and they don't seem like a good fit for what you're doing give them the polite pitch and encourage them to move on (without being rude). If you just go to the show and sit behind the table you'll likely leave disappointed and frustrated. You need to proactive and network as best you can.",1286241057
