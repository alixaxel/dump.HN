1759226,comment,1757709,1758711,0,0,elblanco,,,"I wish comments on HN were sentiment scored for ""humor"" so I could go back and search for humor-as-comments (or at least attempts) as example. Almost nothing gets downvoted on HN faster than an attempt at humor. There are exceptions, but the joke has to be particularly good to not get a -4.<p>IRL, due to the kind of conversation that goes on around here, HN would be akin to the floor of the NYSE on a bad day. Lots of shop talk, not much else. It's all rather sad in a way, but it <i>does</i> keep the content of the site focused. We constantly have meta-discussions here as a defense to keep the conversational content high and there seems to be a community consent that humor, in general, is not for HN.<p>Part of the problem is that what often passes for Internet humor is absurdism. I'm not sure if that's because it's the clearest type of humor you can get across in text while being clear that, ""hey, this is humor <i>hint</i> <i>hint</i>"" since irony and sarcasm are so easily misconstrued in text, or some other effect. But it seems that once a site allows for acceptance of absurdism as part of the dialogue, the information content of the comments seems to drop quickly to near zero. It just introduces so much noise you have to find signal in, and it makes having a high signal conversation so much harder. I find it sad on many levels that HN <i>is</i> such a fun free place, but I <i>get</i> why it is that way.",1286275718

Massive advantage if your subject matter is skewed towards the web anyway.<p>It's not all it's cracked up to be. I just wrote another comment on this.<p>You can get 15% from a major publishing house for a semi-mainstream project, and you're looking at 60% from Amazon. The problem is, you're going to have to pay your own copyeditor, cover design, formatting, presentation, etc with Amazon. Realistically, you're looking at $1500 to $3000 to self-publish a quality piece of self-published work, and that's with a lot of hours of grunt work on your own, and then your work hasn't been shaped by an editor that knows what the market wants.<p>Nonfiction really just doesn't sell very well, so there's a realistic chance you won't recoup your expenses for self publishing. Of course, you could skip having your book copyedited professionally, but then your quality is going to be a lot worse. No matter how good of a writer you are, you get too close to your own work and really should have a professional go over it. When you publish with a mainstream house, that's part of what they do. When you self-publish, you're own your own and out of pocket for that.<p>If you have an opportunity to get paid speaking events or being recognized as an expert would increase your pay, you actually probably stand to make more mainstream publishing. Also, it's still probably better for getting your message out to many people.<p>You can probably maximize short term cash by self publishing if you don't worry as much about production quality, if you alreay have a huge fanbase (like Seth Godin for instance, smart of him to jump into alternate models), and especially if you can speculatively burn $5000 to $10000 to hire professionals and spend some money promoting and you could handle taking a loss or breaking even if it doesn't pan out. If you're already fairly established and successful, self publishing is very viable. If you're not, there's a lot of advantages to being signed to a major house.",1286273395

1759159,comment,1759052,1759052,0,0,all,,,"When considering publishing a book, one must consider how widely applicable the subject matter is and how widely the publisher can actually disseminate your work.  I just published my fourth book, seventh if you count works that I have written for hire.  I do not expect it to do as well as my previous works because the publisher is smaller and the domain of application is much more restricted.  The publisher of my first few books is a subsidiary of HarperCollins and runs bookstores itself, so its channels are much more pervasive.  This is shown in the royalty statements.<p>Self-publishing naturally boosts the ROI on small runs, but it is not without its drawbacks.  Whenever I have thought of a book that I might self-publish, I question whether it is worth writing.  The major publishers know their customer better than I could realistically hope to ever know.  If they would not take it on, one must wonder about the market for it.  I do not say this to mean one should not self-publish, but self-publishing is usually reserved for pet projects that one has developed as a hobby and want to share.  If one is looking for a high ROI on the effort it takes to write a book, the larger publishers are the way to go.<p>Also, the longevity of one's work is directly related to how evergreen the content is.  If one writes something sexy or novel, I suspect one would be lucky to get a year or two of decent sales out of it.  I write as evergreen as I can.  so to this day, I am still receiving cheques from a book that I published 4-5 years ago that are close to the same level as what I received originally.  It remains in the top 3% on Amazon.com.  This is highly unusual, but it can be done.  You will seldom get rich off a single title, but you can develop several streams of passive income if you write well and can engage readers.  My 2¢, fwiw.",1286273119

1759153,comment,1759052,1759052,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I just did a lot of looking into this. First, yes, you nailed it - if you publish with a publisher, you do it because they're going to help you with distribution, presentation, and get you wider reach and impact. It's good for art and exposure, but not as good for getting cash, especially if you already know how to promote or have a significant fanbase.<p>With that said, a couple of things for anyone thinking of getting into this.<p>1. You really want your royalties to be based on ""suggested retail list price"" if possible. That means you get the same amount no matter what price people sell it at. Here's a link that explains more:<p><a href=""http://www.ivanhoffman.com/royalties.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ivanhoffman.com/royalties.html</a><p>> The significant question to ask is: ""Upon what figure is the percentage royalty rate to be calculated?"" In other words, by what number do we multiply the royalty rate? Examples range from ""net monies received by Publisher,"" ""gross cash receipts,"" ""the suggested retail list price,"" ""wholesale price,"" and perhaps other variations on that theme.<p>You're on net, which kind of sucks, because the publishing house and your incentives don't always line up. Generally speaking, publishers want to maximize their profit across the catalog, and might be happy to ""price your work to move"" - I won't get into complicated maths about demand elasticity, but publishers sometimes prefer to sell lots of books at lower prices, even if an individual author would make more at higher prices. If you're on suggested retail price royalties, this is a non-issue and your incentives don't really clash at all. In fact, then it's a big win for you if the mark the book down to sell more copies, which they still likely will as it's the current model of the publishing industry.<p>2. I looked into self-publishing, and you can pick up a 60% royalty rate from Amazon Createspace, but your production quality is going to suck, you're going to need to eat a lot of upfront fees, thus you're taking on a lot of risk, and you're going to have make your own connections with distributors and bookstores and things like that (and you'll be approaching them from a position of lower credibility - they're still quite wary of self-published books).<p>I was going to self publish, but then realizing what Amazon wanted it's kind of ugly. They want an exactly formatted pdf of what your book would look like, and then the production quality is very so-so. And IMO, Amazon Createspace is the best self publishing route because of its tight integration with Amazon. If you go with a different self publishing company, you're looking at even more hassle trying to make distribution work correctly.<p>Geek Atlas looks good - congrats on that. I'll pick up a copy next time I'm settled down and not on the road. Congrats on that, it's a cool project and piece of art that I respect, notwithstanding our internet scuffling.",1286272829
