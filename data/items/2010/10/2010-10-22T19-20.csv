1821244,comment,1820294,1820388,0,0,korch,,,"Look at the dropout rates. In undergrad, nationally, and historically, 50+% do not complete the 4 years to obtain a bachelors degree. Of those who go on to grad school, again, 50%+ withdraw without completing their Phd/Masters.<p>If we as a society are contributing money and other collective resources to make higher education possible, yet more than half of the young people dropout, then it's pretty clear that most of them do not have the ""abilities"" to succeed at higher ed. However, it is far more likely that higher-ed itself is structured completely wrong. If the system fails most people, then most people are not failures, but rather it is the system itself that is the failure.<p>Granted it is highly debatable what ""abilities"" refer to, and what ""success"" entails. Both are mostly arbitrary markers which will be wildly different for everybody.<p>I tend to view things from a different perspective—I'm a cheerleader for the notion of the classical Liberal Arts education, and learning for the sake of becoming a <i>Better Fucking Human Being</i>, not for the purposes of some phony job in a phony society performing whatever phony crap those in power have commanded.<p>By disengaging education from mere financial concerns, my biggest problem with all of this is not that we have thousands of massively underemployed people, but that we have the social expectation that the most educated deserve to be the big shots, manage everything, do little real work, and collect most of the profit just for showing up. Sorry, in this society, you only get those entitlements by luck of birth, inheritance or marriage. <i>Just going to fucking college and earning a piece of paper does not automatically grant it to you.</i><p>Entitlement is really what this article is about, but the author can't just come out and say it, because that would piss off his audience even more than his Bell-Curve innuendo. (Don't even get me started on why some of the most entitled people are incapable of acknowledging it, and pretend otherwise). Many academics are outraged that their so-called highest achievements don't guarantee a high status role in society outside of academia. But the truth is that the value of education and learning is insignificant if you're measuring it by economic metrics. And society at large worships wealth and fame. Just because you have an encyclopedic knowledge of Proust doesn't mean you deserve jack shit from society. Even though there is no way in hell anyone could read Proust and not be enriched and transformed as a person in incalculable ways.<p>This whole article and debate is really an Apples-versus-Oranges false dichotomy, and I'm not sure why I got suckered into writing this long reply. :P<p>tldr;
<i>Being really smart and highly educated should have little to no correlation to your social & financial status in society.</i>",1287777580

I myself am a throwback from the C/C++ days and I frequently re-write stuff in C.  That's how it's supposed to be done.  Write as much as you can as fast as you can up-front, then optimize your bottlenecks using more efficient methods.  I'm happy that C improved your situation that drastically.  I agree that the overhead of lighttpd, then apache, then php might have been the real killer in your situation, and using memcache might have helped also, but making a simple C server using fork() to handle processes and not opening it up to the world is a very good solution in my book.  People think that if enough people start writing things in C, that they'll have to start doing it too - I think that's the reason for all of the backlash.  Remember, there are a <i>bunch</i> of C and C++ programmers out there doing things that perform well and scale, but your audience on HN is mostly php/python/java programmers and web startup people who go the route of optimizing using more trendy technologies instead of down-shifting into a language like C.

And if the point of higher education isn't job training, it's silly to measure its efficacy based on how well it helps graduates into jobs which wouldn't have otherwise been accessible.<p>And the benefit to society of a person (who eventually waits tables) getting an education (which wasn't about how to wait tables) doesn't need to be manifested while that person brings you your check.

Dealing with political rhetoric, forming opinions about sometimes highly technical public policy issues, and understanding economic policy at a minimum require an ability to critically evaluate rhetoric, some level of scientific literacy, and some numeracy, which are all benefited by a well rounded undergrad program. In some places, the political process requires that people not only be able to follow and evaluate political platforms, but produce arguments on their own (I'm thinking of state primary caucuses in particular). Having an educated populace is important independent of the desire of individuals to be wealthy or professionally successful. Just because we need waiters and parking lot attendants and bar tenders doesn't mean education is wasted on the portion of the population which fills that need.<p>If your concern is with public funds subsidizing education, I would actually have greater objection to funding educations for people that go on to earn high salaries in jobs that require high levels of education -- those are students who could afford to take loans and pay them back.",1287776855

Investment banks have been pretty successful at taking their hefty cut of the pie when times are good, but dodging the bullet when bad times inevitably come.  JPMorgan (and other banks) have divisions that do investments for pension funds.  When times are good, they get their share, but recent losses were completely offloaded onto the city pension funds.

Higher octane fuels are more resistant to detonation and pre-ignition, and usually go hand-in-hand with higher compression ratios.<p>As a side note, E85 Ethanol has a ridiculously high octane rating, among other things, which allows for higher compression ratios and much higher boost in forced-induction engines. I keep hoping E85 will catch on outside of the corn belt so I can effectively get race gas performance from pump gas in my turbocharged motor, but no such luck yet.<p>There are plenty of tricks that can be played to reduce the risk of detonation using low-octane fuels in high compression motors. Efficient head design with excellent cooling will reduce cylinder temperatures and minimize hot spotting within the cylinder head, reducing the risks of detonation and pre-ignition. Getting the heat out of the valves is particularly challenging as they only meet the cylinder head in a relatively small contact patch. The valves can be filled with sodium, which turns to liquid as the motor reaches operating temperature and circulates within the valve, cooling the valve and further reduce hot spots (pre-ignition points) within the motor. Also, designing the piston and head to thoroughly mix and swirl the intake charge helps create a quick, even, clean burn.<p>However, to get up to 14:1 on a production motor, I wonder if Mazda is playing serious games with the intake camshaft timing to reduce the effective compression ratio. If you leave the intake valves open long enough after the piston begins the compression stroke, it will actually push a tiny amount of air back out of the intake valves, reducing the effective compression ratio of the motor at top dead center. With variable valve timing, Mazda could just be doing this near full load, where detonation and pre-ignition are problems. At partial load, you can get away with much higher compression ratios (up to 20:1 in certain cases, IIRC) with associated increases in efficiency (and thus higher MPG).<p>Either way, I'm glad to see more efficient internal combustion engines. The internal combustion engine is a 100+ year old technology, so significant improvements are hard to come by without drastically increasing the cost of the motor. Good stuff.",1287774861

The more things change, the more you need to test and retest to be <i>absolutely</i> sure that those changes didn't have any unintended side-effects. This is why, in the process of reaching a GM build, the ability for groups to change components is gradually locked down. The final lock-down is GM, and this usually happens around 1 month before the first customers see the next OS. This time is needed to ""prime the channel"". That is: you need to press the disks, prepare the marketing material and the packaging, do all of the final validation testing, and start shipping the software to stores.<p>In the case of SnowLeopard, that meant that development was done, and GM was declared, in the 3rd week of July.

Well, living people that is, as you do need the books of long deceased thinkers. (I'd say this also applies to philosophy, and hardly anything else). You just need to be willing to spend enormous amounts of time alone in contemplation reading.<p><i>The sole cause of man's unhappiness is that he does not know how to stay quietly in his room.</i><p>— Blaise Pascal<p>There's also a very limited social component layer such as you would find in medicine, law, politics, economics, et al. To become a doctor, or any kind of ""professional"", sure, it requires a massive social apparatus on top of a high degree of actual learning. You have to have connections, know the right people, say the right and popular things to them, be supported and credentialed by the leadership and their agenda, and basically imposture one's self into mimicking whatever behaviors and traits are specific to and dominant in whatever professional field you're studying. Eventually your identity morphs into this set of learned behaviors, and it's almost entirely built upon your position in some type of social hierarchy.<p>Not so with math. You either know some theorem and the proof, or you don't. How much you know and how advanced you are is <i>entirely</i> dependent upon what you have worked through on your own. What new stuff you can create only comes from what old stuff you already know. None of this has anything to do with interacting with people. Sure, you can benefit by talking to other mathematicians, attending lectures, conferences, teaching others, etc, but at the end of the day, at some point, you still have to sit down and <i>learn</i> the material by yourself. And if you don't do that, it doesn't matter how much of a social butterfly you are—you can't be a mathematician.<p><i>No man is an island</i>, but I imagine a Robinson Crusoe type figure would have no such problems becoming a mathematician on a desert island, given enough math books(<i>and some kind of Internet connection</i>).",1287774753

In retrospect it seems a bit odd that OSX ever included Flash in the first place. Adding that extra distribution layer may give the user the illusion that Apple is responsible for keeping Flash updated. No one wants that responsibility. Not even Adobe. As far as I can tell the only way to keep Flash updated is to check Adobe's website every so often. I didn't hear a peep from Apple or Adobe about 10.1 being released. No automatic update here.",1287774061
