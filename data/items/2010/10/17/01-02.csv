And that's exactly the reason why I won't watch political films... not even if they're saying something I agree with.<p>For a complicated issue like corporate personhood (if indeed that's what this is about), I'm willing to entertain arguments either way, but I want them written down in black text on white paper and limited to a few pages, so I know I'm not being manipulated. And then I'd like to seek out an opposing viewpoint in a similar format, and make up my own mind. I don't see why anyone would want to subject themselves to a political film at all.",1287280779

And when they ""officially"" started endorsing <i>some</i> open source, it was in the context of their own open source licenses and their own open source hosting website.<p>Then they try and develop web technology, Silverlight, that is better than Flash by technical standards but is so entrenched in Microsoft-land that hardly anyone wants to do anything with it. You can't author anything for it when using Apple and Linux doesn't even get a runtime (Mono doesn't count, can never be feature-complete).<p>Apple doesn't seem quite the same. A lot of Apple developers are active in other developer communities. Microsoft developers seem to stick to Microsoft technologies.

The language didn't need to change much. The two things that have changed are so major they couldn't be majorer: (1) it took people 10 years to actually figure out what they had in JS; (2) the implementations needed to catch up.

Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and working towards that (those?) goal(s) and you'll be there before you know it. If you've worked with startups before, just not the technical side, talk with some of the programmers you know and ask them to give you a lesson or two or even just direct you towards some good resources and cheat-sheets (these are a lifesaver for me).
