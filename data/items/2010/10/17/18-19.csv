1801087,comment,1800002,1800698,0,0,purpledove,,,"Clojure, like Lisp, has terrible syntax that is difficult for human beings to read. This is one of the reasons the academic community kept Lisp alive - independence from industry, ability to weed out weaker programmers, flexibility.<p>I'm well aware that I'm posting this on Hacker News, a site founded by an individual who made gazillions on a website powered by Lisp --- I think it is safe to say that it is the exception rather than the rule.<p>In order to be widely accepted, a language must do many things well enough. If it fails badly at one particular thing, in this case syntax readability, its ability to gain followers will be severely diminished. It may, however, gain a strong following in academia.<p>If you disagree, then do this thought experiment: who currently uses serious parallel processing power? I can think of a few: Blizzard's WoW servers, government research labs, and bio-informatics operations. How would you convince them to try out Clojure? What problem do they have that Clojure solves so much better than anything else out there that it would gain a foothold?<p>By the way, I learned CS from Abelson and Sussman and Scheme was my language of choice between 1996 and 2004.",1287341908

Many of these companies contribute back to the projects or start new projects of their own. It bothers me to no end when I see representatives of <i>these same companies</i> claiming that open-source is some kind of disease. I understand the ramifications of using some licenses (GPL, AGPL) in the wrong way, but thinking open-source is bad or dangerous is going to leave you out of the big leagues in this day and age, for many markets, at least.<p>Sure, you need a business model, and you need to make money, and you're almost surely not going to make money by just developing an open-source product.<p>But, companies these days win on the service they provide and the continued development they put into their product, as long as the continued enhancements to the product are of significant value to the customer (subscription model or timed-support/upgrade-license model).<p>I talked recently to someone in a new startup recently that had a really bad attitude. She didn't understand why all of the companies were developing solutions for a large enterprise product were embracing open-source, and she thought that her startup was going to put the rest of the solution providers to shame because she would reap the benefits of keeping all of the code developed by her company to themselves. I understand not wanting to give away the bank, but that type of attitude especially in the market that she was trying to enter will not work. I'd hope that her way of thinking was the exception rather than the norm, but I'm sure it is prevalent within many larger companies, where they are far enough away from the developers and IT workers that they just have no freakin' clue what goes on there.",1287340975

Their trails (nicknames, ip addresses, writing styles and so on) usually make it fairly easy to identify them anyway. To a man I've never had any real life contact with these people and I've always wondered what is driving their hatred.<p>A friend of mine - female - who is a local celebrity has a file folder full of nastygrams, she jokingly refers to it as the kill-file, in case she ever gets murdered we should go through it, the culprit will surely be in there somewhere.<p>One part of why the HN community attracts negative attention from time to time I think is that being rejected for YC is a slap in the face to some that can't understand the difference between limited time and resources and a thing to take personal.<p>So they will rant about the 'cult' around PG, as if by trashing it they can make themselves feel better for not being a part of it.<p>On the highway, you need a driving license, on the internet you need no such thing, which is good, but comes with inevitable downsides as well.<p>Personally I couldn't care less about these childish attempts at attacking me, one funny fragment from the comment referenced seems to imply that I should be the one to want to do business with some vitriol spouting troll, see, that's what I meant with real life collaboration flowing from writing and interacting under your own name with others.

But the story can be interpreted by both sides. The selfish side turns this into some kind of a lottery -- ""Be good to people, you never know when you'll meet a Donald Trump in disguise and he will reward your beyond measure"" or from the pure altruism side -- ""Look be nice to people, it is the right thing to do, a small gesture one your part might make a large impact on them""<p>Then of course, as you mentioned, there is the fairy tale angle. Few would be impressed by an article that read something like : ""It was a cold rainy night, I picked up a woman waiting for a bus in the rain and took her home. I don't know who she was or even her name. The end."" I think those things happen to people but they just don't make good blog stories.

In fact I said ""has many, if not most"".  I was trying to be explicit that not all features that exist in every functional language exist.<p>Now with that said, the specific features you list, while popular, weren't widely considered ""necessary"" features to be classified as a functional language.  For example, Scheme has neither pattern matching nor ADTs. Although I'll grant you that for modern functional languages its near a prerequisite. And AFAIK tail call elimination is less a function of the language, and more of the implementation (and I'd argue to the extent that you write in a functional style, many/most production quality compilers of imperative languages will do this optimization).  Of course I could be wrong and maybe some functional languages define in their spec exactly when tail call elimination must invoked.<p>If you look at what is commonly the crux of functional languages you'll see things like:<p>* Recursion -- yes, there was a time imperative languages didn't support recursion.  So when they were arguing Lisp vs Fortran this was relevant.  Now this seems like such a passe feature of all languages, but I think its worth point out.<p>* First class functions.<p>* Lambdas and closures<p>* Immutable data<p>* Pure functions<p>* ADTs or other interesting type systems<p>And there are some second order features like list comprehensions.<p>Again, I think if you go through this list, you'll see that modern imperative languages capture a lot of these features.  Not necessarily all of them, but I have discovered that I've been able to do some relatively straightforward ports of functional algorithms, keeping all of the functionalism intact.",1287339857

Not to mention the fact that nothing about the name tells you what it actually does, something the rest of your examples manage.",1287338810

To avoid paying duplicate corporate franchise tax and registered agent fees, you should just incorporate in the state where you are physically located. However, if you have other considerations (like raising funding), this may not work.<p>Depending on the state you incorporate in and the number of shares outstanding you have, there may be fees on a per-share basis that you should check into.<p>Payroll taxes vary from place to place, but there's not much you can do about it--you have to pay them for the state where you're located. California currently has four types of payroll taxes: income tax withholding, unemployment insurance, the employment training tax (ETT) and state disability insurance (SDI). (See <a href=""http://www.edd.ca.gov/payroll_taxes/rates_and_withholding.htm."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edd.ca.gov/payroll_taxes/rates_and_withholding.ht...</a>) You can deduct SDI you've paid for the year on your 1040.<p>The type of corporation matters, too. The California corporate franchise tax rate for S corporations is 1.5%. For C corporations it's 8.84%. This only matters for startups that actually are bringing in revenue--otherwise you just have to pay the $800 minimum--but if you are actually making money it's a pretty big difference.<p>I'm not a CPA, just for the record.",1287338772

It's paid for by advertising on the television service (or premium Hulu Plus subscriptions paid by individual consumers), so cutting this off is really just sour grapes on Fox's part.<p>ESPN does run such an arrangement with their ESPN3 streaming service -- it's only available if your ISP has paid ESPN, or if you're a user at a university.",1287338705
