My solution is that one of my VPSes runs a Virtual Private American: Apache running mod_proxy.  Any web request proxied through the Virtual Private American appears to originate from a computer in St. Louis... because it does.  I use a proxy switching addon in Chrome and Firefox to magically turn American whenever e.g. Amazon gives me guff about it.  Then I can pay for the content of my choice using my American credit cards.  (If you don't have one, you can fake it with a stored payments card.)<p>Morally, it isn't my finest hour (it is technical breach of contract with Amazon, it makes a minor imposition on the eventual rightsholder of the Japanese version, possibly retards the ability of the content to licitly reach Japan, and possibly transgresses a secular law which enjoys a presumption of moral legitimacy), but it is a much less grave offense than theft.",1287359393

I live in Australia, so somewhere between US & Lithuania in convenience stakes, and we get the same ""not available in your region"" BS. I spent some time in NYC last year, and the ease & availability of digitally delivered content blew me away. Bring it on!<p>* There _are_ countries where piracy is the only sensible option. You own a Kindle, so I'm assuming you can afford a $20US hardback book. I used to live in Indonesia, where my housemates earned ~$60USD a month. Although they didn't have their own computers (or Kindles), some of our neighbours had computers (P2-era in 2004) and every piece of software was pirated. I don't even know where they would go to buy legit copies if they wanted them.<p>I think you can make a case for piracy in these circumstances. In fact, even Microsoft did - they gave the Indonesian government licenses for all of the Microsoft software on their computers, in exchange for them agreeing to pay for more licenses (at reduced rates) in the future.<p>Thankfully, Linux is (or was) growing in popularity in Indonesia as an alternative free (and ethical) option.<p>* Finally, I would say that this shows there exists a market for a site like <a href=""http://booko.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://booko.com.au/</a>, targeted to ex-USSR countries.

1801768,comment,1800002,1801696,0,0,Chris_Newton,,,"> I think there's a large opportunity cost to dismissing concurrency & parallelism at this moment.<p>I'm not dismissing the idea, nor claiming that it is not valuable for any application. Clearly that parallelism would have value to a significant number of projects, which perhaps don't make best use of the host hardware today. I'm just trying to keep the multi-core idea in perspective, relative to other ways our programming languages might improve.<p>Better multi-core support can get you a constant factor speed-up in computationally expensive work, but Amdahl's Law tends to spoil even that. On the other hand, a language with a type system that allows you to prevent entire classes of programmer error could lead to a step change in security or robustness. A language expressive enough to capture the developer's intent in ways that today's programming models do not could lead to entirely new techniques for keeping designs flexible, supporting new rapid development processes, or it could create opportunities for optimisers that bring the performance of more expressive languages to a level where they compete with lower-level languages used in the same field today for speed reasons. I suspect that across the field of programming as a whole, such improvements would be far more widely applicable.",1287359076

1801754,comment,1800957,1801288,0,0,derefr,,,"TextMate is horrible for writing prose. Unlike programming, where you perform discrete edits (like adding/refactoring a function, changing a constant value, etc.) changes to prose are continuous; ideally, every action (add character, backspace, move cursor) should be a separate ""micro-commit."" Similarly, syntax highlighting is almost guaranteed to screw up when one tries to write prose with it; I have yet to see a text format (HTML, Markdown, Mediawiki markup...) where you can paste in the current plaintext draft of your novel, and the second half of the book won't become highlighted entirely in green because it's ""inside"" an unpaired asterisk.<p>Ideally, a prose editor would be a minimalistic WYSIWYG editor, where each formatting option mapped to a feature of Markdown. The ""document format"" would, internally, be a Markdown document stored in a git repository—but actual Markdown text would be escaped if pasted into the editor itself, so this would just be an implementation detail (except if you tried to copy-and-paste from the editor to a plain textarea—then you'd get Markdown, which is better than losing formatting altogether.) The editor would auto-commit each and every change; undoing and then typing something else would create a branch.<p>Other people could work on a document/repo with you; the editors would P2P-send operational transformations when they knew that others had the same document open in the editor, with eventual consistency guaranteed by committing the changes to the repo asynchronously (where each user is committing their current view of the operationally-transformed state, so no git-level non-fast-forward merges are needed, unless the users are actually working on purposefully-made separate branches.)",1287358583

You need to know your audience if you want to speak with it and pivot your product accordingly:<p>It seems that most of their successful pivots came from interaction and analysis of users. The concept of Bed and Breakfast service morphed into a community marketplace for space after they discovered a user is renting an apartment while they're absent (on a tour with a popular musician). Instead of sanctioning the user, they changed the rules, thus enabling another category of service. Knowing that musicians leave an empty apartment behind when they travel on tours gave them an insight, that probably helped them identify user segments worth communicating the service with.<p>* Focus on one thing and you will achieve it:<p>PG gave them a pretty good target for Demo Day, profitability. They did what is a common goal-oriented approach: they hung a graph of their profitability ratio on a clearly visible space they would encounter every day (bathroom mirror). By hands-on engaging with users directly, pivoting the business model as required, they managed to pull off the profitability breakthrough two weeks before Demo Day.<p>* Dive into payments:<p>End in end, using an outsourced payment solution proved to be more hassle than it was worth. They started processing payments and charging their 10% provision although they were just three people, and it seemed like a huge responsibility to take. Now it seems logical.<p>* Persevere:<p>It took them almost three years of hustling, with more-or less a traffic flatline, credit card debt and dealing with a hopeless horizon, to finally come to an awesome business model, which in retrospect would seem impossible to build.",1287357470

So here goes (just the first paragraph mind you because this can get tiring).<p>>>> I've written before about my deep skepticism regarding the true motives of Canonical, Ltd.'s advocacy and demand of for-profit corporate copyright assignment without promises to adhere to copyleft.<p>There is nothing wrong with Canonical requiring copyright assignment. The FSF do it, SUN did it, I would guess Microsoft does it. It is not unusual for a corporation to be a for-profit entity. There is no way someone would do unpaid work for somebody else and get nothing in return unless they were a slave or forced to do so. How would it be even possible to contribute to a Canonical project if you are not part of Canonical if the codebase is not freely accessible or at least in some way open?<p>>>> I've often asked Canonical employees, including Jono Bacon, Amanda Brock, Jane Silber, Mark Shuttleworth himself, and — in the comments of this very blog post — Matt Asay to explain (a) why exactly they demand copyright assignment on their projects, rather than merely having contributors agree to the GNU GPL formally (like projects such as Linux do),<p>That's interesting because the issue of copyright assignment arose when SCO started the whole litigation thing against Linux (well, Linux companies). Also, again, canonical is a for-profit corp, Linux is a (as you say) project so you can't compare them. I wonder what the policy of the Linux Foundation is?<p>>>> and (b) why, having received a contributor's copyright assignment, Canonical, Ltd. refuses to promise to keep the software copylefted and never proprietarize it (FSF, for example, has always done the latter in assignments).<p>Why should they promise? It's not their job to promise such things. The, again, are a corporation and have to look after themselves. They are not the FSF which is as far as I remember, a charity. What does Redhat do? Or Novell? We know that SUN required copyright assignment for OOo so it's not unreasonable for corps to have this requirement. If your issue is with code being worked on by individuals not employed by Canonical, with that work then being used in non GPL projects and with the copyright assignment of that work being handed over to Canonical then fair enough - please show me how this happens and where.<p>>>> When I ask these questions of Canonical, Ltd. employees, they invariably artfully change the subject.<p>Seriously.

1801691,comment,1800839,1801448,0,0,thwarted,,,"Okay, here are some:<p>Be aware of how the init/startup system works on the machines your software is going to be deployed to.  If you're writing a long running network service, then this means providing an init.d script that provides at least start, stop, restart, and status actions.  Learn enough of shell scripting to write this script in sh or bash, not in some more heavyweight language like python or perl or php or ruby.<p>Write services that don't need to be running as root and/or know how to cease being root after their setup stage. Don't hardcode any settings (like port being listened on, or user to run as).  Make a config file.  And don't make it XML.  Make it easy to build a package, deb or rpm, by providing the necessary debian/ dir contents or .spec file.<p>When the systems team says there's a bug in your code, fix it.  If you don't, you risk having the notifications for the failed service being sent to <i>your</i> phone waking you up.  When code is changing all the time, there's more likely to be a bug in your code than there is to have a random system configuration or hardware issue.  In many cases, machines with hardware problems are most likely already removed from service before you even know about it.<p>Don't <i>make</i> the systems team debug your code and provide a patch.  I know a lot of developers who think systems people don't/can't program or they only know how to ""script""; that's not true, being able to program is one thing that, I think, is required to be on the systems team.  We'll help you debug and provide the tools to get things resolved, but we shouldn't have patch your code for you.<p>Don't write services that keep a lot of internal, in-memory state that isn't saved to disk periodically such that it can't pick up where it left off if it is restarted.<p>Do write services that allow easy introspection into its state.  The memcached ""stats"" command is an example.  This allows us to easily hook your code into things like ganglia.  Some programs, when sent a signal, dump info to a log file.<p>Speaking of log files, use techniques to detect if your log file has changed and reopen it if its rotated (stat(logfilename) != fstat(logfilefd)).<p>Those who don't learn /bin and /usr/bin are doomed to reinvent them, poorly.  Don't waste time reimplementing things that already exist.  Like xargs. Or head. Or wc. Or yes. Or host. Or watch.<p>Learn how to use the stuff in binutils, like objdump, nm and strings.<p>Don't write scripts in python or perl or ruby or php that do some weird setup (like parsing command line arguments) and then just invoke something via the shell with system().  On the off chance you do need to do this, use exec instead.<p>Don't name scripts that might be integrated with other tools or batch jobs with a language specific extension (unless this is required by your platform, <i>cough</i> ahem) or it's a language specific library.  Reserve .py for python modules, for example.  The reason here is that your perl script might be rewritten as ruby one day or optimized by porting it to C, and there might be stuff calling it, and then you end up with a ruby script named .pl.  We don't name C binaries ending with a .c extension, your ""production"" scripts are logically ""binaries"" if not physically. (I've actually run across this).<p>Use or create proper library routines to access structured data files.  As a contrived example, use getpwent, don't parse /etc/passwd by yourself.<p>Put a password on your ssh private key.<p>Don't architect distributed things that require passwordless ssh keys to run.  If you need to distribute files to a bunch of machines, they should be pulled from an rsync or http server, rather than via scp or remoting invoking rsync over ssh.<p>Learn about sudo, because you're going to have to use it.<p>Learn the difference between tmpnam, mktemp and mkstemp, and why you should use mkstemp.<p>Honor the TMPDIR environment variable.<p>Don't fill up the disks.  When you get automated quota emails, do something about it.<p>Don't work around the limits that have been put in place on systems, they are most likely there for a reason; if you are hitting a limit, we're open to having them changed.  For example, if there's a 4 gig address space limit on a machine for user xyz, don't work around that by changing the user your code runs as.<p>Write runbook documentation.  This means somewhat of a Q&A style ""How do I..."" or ""What to do when X, Y, Z"".  Make them easy to visually scan, make keywords standout.  Hopefully, your systems team has provided a place for these to be stored that is easily accessible and easy to update.  A lot of people get bogged down when writing documentation, trying to figure out what's appropriate to document.  A runbook, which is a living document, makes this easier, because it's obvious that you add to it as problems or corner cases crop up.<p>I'm sure I could come up with some more.",1287356796

Well, fine. You definitely don't sound like a people person. But if this is what you think, you are probably ignoring a lot of other people too. And missing out on a lot of opportunities and great relationships because of it.",1287356791

The ability for the program to convert the units between Imperial and Metric. This way, it doesn't matter where your recipe comes from. As Epicurious is American, and I am in Australia, this would be my number 1.<p>2. The ability for the app to product a consolidated shopping list. So if I pick a few recipes to get ingredients for, it should produce a consolidated shopping list (ie. combine the same products)<p>3. An ingredient glossary. Some recipe's have things I have never heard of in. It would be good to be able to link through to a glossary to learn more about it<p>4. Another good thing would be the ability to plan out a week of food, or even have suggested menus based on what I have eaten in the past (This is probably getting a little heavy...). It could be based on the concept of 'Other people who ate X had Y'. Linking this with the consolidated shopping list would also be quite handy.<p>5. Dare I say it, but some sort of social element would be good. Adopting KISS, it could be like the <a href=""http://pinboard.in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pinboard.in</a> of recipes. Very simple tags, etc.<p>------<p>Another one.<p>6. When you cook something for someone, and they ask for the recipe, it would be cool to be able to send it to their instance of Paprika or export a formatted PDF (On top of the email)",1287356616
