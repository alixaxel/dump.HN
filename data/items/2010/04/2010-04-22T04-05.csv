1284188,comment,1283935,1284103,0,0,samratjp,,,"I concur :-) Apple will be more likely to buy a company that will reduce a hop on their supply chain; in that sense, a GPU maker makes sense.<p>But it is funny to speculate as a laymen - I mean what if Google bought AMD instead? That would give them a crazy position to experiment with hardware and keep a check on Apple - after all, Google means serious business with the Nexus one and the mythical tablet. And we all know Google likes to experiment with 3D stuff in browsers and such. Again, I am just blithering- with Google's purchase of AMD (+ATI), they might just have crazy nice open-source 3D tools, maybe even a cloud platform for map-reduce rendering work (take that Pixar - yet another Steve Jobs production).<p>But on the other hand, Microsoft is the one who could benefit the most from buying AMD. For one thing, MSFT gets ATI for Xbox 360, a platform that MSFT has well executed. And now, Microsoft even make their own chips from win 7 mobile phones to consoles. To really keep Apple's market cap away from them, MSFT panics and makes their own hardware and opens up retail stores :-P",1271911417

1284163,comment,1283821,1283976,0,0,hristov,,,"I agree. I went to their website and saw how the technology works, and it seems really iffy. The way they recognise that two phones were bumped into each other is by having each phone contact a central server and having the central server compare the timing of the two events as well as some rough location information.<p>So this means that you have to send your data through their central servers. Yes, it is encrypted, etc. but I would feel much safer if it were encrypted and sent locally instead.<p>Also I am sure as it gets popular there will be issues with timing, such as different people bumping at the same time, or the bumps being mistimed, due to differences in the way the wireless networks of two different providers time stamp the various notifications.<p>So it seems that while the act of bumping may give an impression of security (i.e., that you know for sure who you are sending your data to), this impression is illusory which means you will have to authenticate the recipient anyways, so you might as well use bluetooth.<p>And as somebody else noted if they devoted the same efforts to bluetooth, I am sure they could make their app just as nice.

I reached a critical mass of friends where every time I was on I could click on ""Chat"" and see a few friends on.<p>2. I started chatting with a Facebook ""poweruser""[1] who said she was going to ""teach me how to be cool"" by using Facebook better.<p>3. Partly thanks to (2), I started updating my status a few times a week, whenever I had something interesting[3] to share.<p>4. People started commenting on and ""Like""ing my status updates.<p>5. I realized that it was pretty cool to be able to connect meaningfully[4] with people in a way that I couldn't before.<p>I love creating and building things, but social interaction with people I enjoy is just as important to me. Facebook is an invaluable tool in that interaction, just as a great IDE is an invaluable tool in programming. Just like an IDE, Facebook is most valuable when you are using it to its full potential. If you don't have a large number of Facebook friends and you don't use Chat and status updates, it's easy to miss the point. Perhaps you've experienced the difficulty in explaining the benefits of emacs or vi to an Eclipse or VisualStudio user?<p>---<p>[1] I was at a Taco Bell one night after my friends and I left the bar, and somehow we started talking to a girl and her friends. I walked them home, she got my name, she added me as a Facebook friend, and now we chat on Facebook a few times a month. If not for Facebook, I probably would have never seen her again. <i>That</i> is what makes Facebook relevant, the ability to create new (and keep old[2]) connections that weren't even possible before Facebook got huge.<p>[2] <i>Just tonight</i> I was talking to a friend on Facebook when another girl said hello to me, a girl that I was good friends with a couple summers ago but haven't seen or talked to much since. Now we're probably going to meet up tomorrow night to catch up over drinks.<p>[3] For certain values of ""interesting""<p>[4] With Facebook-as-it-is-now, it is possible to tell people that you are barely friends with, ""I appreciate you and I'm glad to be friends with you,"" simply by Liking or commenting on a photo, status update, or shared link.

1284117,comment,1283190,1283190,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Another element of the buy-vs-rent-home issue that I think is important but it rarely mentioned is the whole illusion of ""owning"" a home.<p>In my lingo, if I own something, I'm done paying for it. I paid for it. Done. Now it's mine. I don't have to KEEP ON paying for it. In the typical ""own a home"" scenario, even after a mortgage is paid off, you have to keep right on paying for that house each month/year. At a minimum, you have to pay home ownership taxes. Notice you do not have to pay ongoing ""just because you own it"" taxes on most other items that you own. A computer. A book. Clothing. Once you own them, they are yours, you don't need to keep paying for them.<p>But if there's some fee an external entity is essentially forcing you to pay, either directly or indirectly by threat of force, then you do not really own it. You are renting it. The key question is if you were to stop paying a certain fee whether some big mean people will come and take it away from you. If that's true, you are only renting it.<p>Arguably the OA is about comparing one kind of renting to another kind of renting. There are advantages to each, but in both scenarios you <i>will</i> be paying for the home for the rest of your life. And so will the next ""owner"", and the next, and so on.<p>There is no spoon.",1271909333
