He'd develop live on the server, no version control, yap at you over IM or across the room to get out of the file that he was editing, restart Apache every few seconds to get mod_python to reload. It was absolute chaos. He's a great hacker and a brilliant guy, but some people are truly shooting themselves in the foot for the sake of being ""old school"". It all comes down to a stubborn laziness. There's definitely a balance between sticking to what you know and prematurely ejaculating over the latest and greatest technologies.

The consequences of this go much further than just speeding up algorithms-- we can take plain old linear methods like SVMs and apply them to any data type on which we can define a kernel. This is huge, because it allows machine learning to break free of the vector world in which the algorithms are classically defined. Want to classify gene sequences? You don't have to hack them into a fixed-width vector, just define a string kernel for genes. Want to classify fragments of lambda calculus? Just define an appropriate tree kernel.

I hope that Weave Sync one day makes it into Firefox trunk, as it's an extremely useful extension that goes well beyond what most bookmark/password sync extensions do. Sadly, it is limited to Firefox and Fennec right now.",1272417760
