1252512,comment,1252177,1252177,0,0,ableal,,,"Just yesterday, I ran some calculations based on a different assumption, just on raw economics. It goes like this:<p>1) Suppose that ""intellectual property"" (IP) is taxed, like real estate. Say at a T = 1% rate, to keep it simple. This pays for the property protection service the state provides.<p>2) But the holder does not actually pay tax. He just accumulates back payments to the state, at an interest rate R per year.<p>3) When the state is owed 100% of the value, the IP reverts to the public domain.<p>This has the advantage that the property value does not matter - it can be 1, 100, 100k; nothing to haggle there. It is just assumed to be constant for the period considered.<p>Run your own calculations. Mine were that with a T=1% tax rate, and a R=5% interest rate on unpaid tax, you get 37 years. (26 years for R=10%, 47 years for R=3%.)<p>P.S.<p>I got curious, and just checked with a lower tax rate T=0.5%. R seems to dominate T.
