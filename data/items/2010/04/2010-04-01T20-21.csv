Identifying demand is difficult.  My guess is their demand was underestimated.  This is a product focusing on an area of life that everyone I can think of wants to ""fix"".   All of my coworkers who I consider ""early adopters"", also pre-ordered after I IMed them the URL (16 people)<p>- It's priced significantly lower than the few alternatives that are out there.  It's also designed in a way that is more convenient than similar products offered by competitors (no head bands).<p>- Smartphones are common now, so the barrier for entry really is the $50 for most people<p>- Hardware is difficult to get right.  You can't just tweak a few lines of code and recompile.  If something is wrong with the trial units (and I'm not saying there was, I have no idea), it can be a serious setback.<p>It's too late now, but here's the formula that should be applied:<p>- Decide the amount of pre-orders you think you can safely get out the door on time (be incredibly conservative).  Set your web app to stop taking pre-orders when you get anywhere near that point.<p>- Before turning pre-orders back on, up the price committment, and push back the date (while notifying your initial pre-orders that they can still expect theirs on time).  I know when I visited the site, I thought ""Gee, I'm out $5 if they fold, who cares?""  It's also the only reason I haven't cancelled my pre-order.<p>- Pick a very conservative ship date, then add more time.  Have an option at check-out that says ""if we can ship earlier, would you like us to?"" to catch folks who might be caught off guard by the unexpected $45 charge.  Or skip that and simply e-mail your pre-orders to see who wants one early.  Nothing makes me happier than when I get something I want sooner than I expected.<p>- Hire someone with a history of dealing with sourcing parts, dealing with vendors/manufacturers and getting stuff out the door.  These are usually not geeks and not folks who are attracted to start-ups.<p>- Don't take any preorders until you are sure you have the hardware right (as I said, I'm not sure if this was the problem but the delays are so long it certainly smells that way)",1270153631

That's a pretty big assumption.<p>I am non-technical and I think I fit pretty well with B) in that article. I always said that even if I did not /understand/ programming I certainly appreciated it. That meant I could appreciate how difficult something would be to implement, whereas those non-technical people who did not appreciate programming (my superiors) would ask for something they thought was simple then go ape when it wasn't implemented immediately.<p>I would spend hours locked away with my programming colleague while I explanied the business logic for what I needed, he would map out that database concepts. Eventually I got a pretty good appreciation for databases.<p>I'd admit it didn't work perfectly - as a first-timer and more or less accidental project manager I allowed us to over-complicate the project. Were I to do it a second time I would be much better at KISS.<p>Based on my experience I would have to say it is incorrect to say it ""just doesn't work"".",1270152173

1235285,comment,1235108,1235108,0,0,WesleyJohnson,,,"At my last job (doing .NET Web Dev), I spent the first 2 years under a manager who knew absolutely nothing about programming or really anything technical for that matter. He was, for all intents and purposes, originally hired as a henchman to weed out bad employees because the CEO hated being the bad guy. That made him the COO and as such, the head of IT as well because of how the company was strucuted (or not structured).<p>The last 2 years saw me working under someone who had been programming for a living for many years. While he was, by his own words, a bit out of his prime and behind the times, the difference between working for the two was night and day. Deadlines became more attainable, requirements became more realisitic and when difficult decisions arose we had someone who could go to bat for the IT department as apposed to someone who always sided with the ""sales"" portion of the business.<p>In my mind, anyone directly overseeing a developer should know how to program as well. In small organizations and start-ups, that's not always possible, but if you're somewhat established and you have an IT/IS director, manager, CIO or what have you that can't program a lick .... I think there's an issue there.",1270152131
