1287212,comment,1287110,1287110,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"Fucking asshole. Almost no one <i>wants</i> to change jobs every 12 months. Looking for work is a pain in the ass and changing jobs is inherently risky. Everyone goes into a job hoping they will work out so well at the company as to have no incentive to leave... at least for 5-10 years. All this is even more true for the best employees, because the number of desirable employers drops off faster than the number of talented people. (The best people, who want only to work at the best companies, have what is in a way the most difficult kind of job search.)<p>Job hopping is almost always involuntary-- not in the sense of a person getting fired, but in the sense of a person being wise enough to realize that he's in a position that his wasting his time, and moving on-- the rational response.<p>The ""job hopper"" stigma originally came into existence because people who did so would rise rapidly in salary through iterated negotiations; in times such as the late 1990s, it's possible to get to a very high salary level this way. Pursued inflexibly, it's a terrible strategy in the long term, because it makes you less likely to end up as someone's protege (rolling stone, no moss) and eventually compensation will reflect the resulting stagnation. But most ""job hoppers"" do not fall into this category; they change jobs not because they are trying to game the system, but because they realize they are wasting time.<p>If your career is not improving-- you're not learning, inadequately mentored, and no one is looking out for your advancement-- then you should change jobs as soon as you can do so with minimal harm to the company. (If you're in a small company, it might be right to stay on for a couple months, at least to train someone else.) Since most people are not and cannot be ""protege"", this means that it's good to shift around a few times until finding a fit.<p>Likewise, everyone has to do some grunt work and deal with some unpleasantness, and recognizing this is just being a mature person, but anyone who finds out his job is mostly or entirely grunt work, or work unrelated to his career (e.g. the programmer who gets put full-time on office tasks) is wasting time and should leave.<p>Sorry, but I have to say all this because I am sick and fucking tired of people ripping on my generation for not playing by someone else's shitty rules. Are the older people really so damn entitled as to not understand all this? And how can they expect loyalty to companies when layoffs happen all the time?",1271995117

And I think this article is bullshit.<p>Am I wrong for choosing the path that brings me personal success at the cost of ""company loyalty""?  The depiction of an ideal employee painted by this author sounds a lot like the Japanese Salaryman - diligent and loyal to the company.  Isn't that model considered totally broken?  Company loyalty as a top priority comes at the cost of ineffectiveness and lower morale.  It just doesn't seem right.<p>If your employees are being scalped away at salary+15, maybe you're not paying them enough.  If your employees are working 12 months and switching jobs, maybe you don't offer enough internal growth.  If your are rejecting applications of ""job hoppers"", maybe you're leaving major value on the table.<p>In Silicon Valley, it's an employee's market.

1287200,comment,1287110,1287110,0,0,gphil,,,"I'm ambivalent about this. A few times in the article the author suggests that only in a small percentage of cases is job-hopping justified, but I think it's actually justified in far more than a small percentage of cases.<p>The fact of the matter is that contemporary work culture is (for better or worse) progressing towards lower job security, and more job hopping is an inevitable consequence of this. When job security goes down in the economic community, the propensity for job hopping goes up--even when employee's jobs are not directly at risk. This is a natural and rational response to low job security.<p>Judging workers who have job hopped in the past can be unfair to those workers, especially when many companies are decreasing their own loyalty to their employees. Why shouldn't workers chase higher paychecks outside of their current companies, if those companies don't adequately value their worth? If an employer has not demonstrated a commitment to retaining its employees, it shouldn't expect any commitment in return.<p>That said, I do agree with the fundamental sentiment behind the article--that companies who are loyal to their employees should prefer employees that will be loyal to them in return.",1271994787

1287116,comment,1286346,1286961,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> Are you left handed?<p>No. The reason it is more efficient is because the mouse pointer usually hovers more around the left and upper edges of the windows. That is where all the most frequent menus live are and most often used toolbar buttons. You can think of it as the logical origin of the window. For example the 'File->Save As..."" menu, the ""File->Close"" menu, the ""Back & Home"" buttons on the browser and so on.<p>It would be an interesting HCI project to run a background statistics gatherer that would record mouse coordinates relative the window in focus.<p>The only time I usually move the mouse to right is to scroll (but I personally use the mouse wheel for scrolling) and resize the window.  But most of the time it hovers on the left side.<p>Also, just because you hold the mouse in the right hand doesn't say anything where the cursor is on the screen. You would have to consider where the cursor already is when you want to close/minimize/maximize the window and how far you would have to ""travel"" with it.<p>Another 2 things to consider:<p>1) Mouse travel might seem like a very small change, but the action of closing a window is very frequent. So a small change multiplied many times can add to quite a bit.<p>2) This ends up working even better for laptops since a trackpad already offers a fairly small working surface compared to the surface available for a desktop mouse. The shorter the distance the cursor moves, the less trackpad ""strokes"" one has to perform.<p>EDIT: formatting & syntax",1271991901
