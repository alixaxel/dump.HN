This is true whether the domain is manufacturing, fashion, tech, etc. However, after they've been at it for N months and have nothing done, the smart ones realize the error of their ways ;-)<p>Business savvy (just like technical skill) is a necessary (but not sufficient) requirement for being a successful entrepreneur. Having co-founders with disparate skill sets helps you cover all your bases.<p>I think just as many engineers think they can build something cool (with no thought to marketing, capital, strategy, etc), and build a start-up.",1270157303

That actually has me cracking up right now.<p>So, it's not like this particular person had a precedent to conclude that I was more likely trying to be a dick, rather than having fun in accordance to my previous messages. Something made her completely miss the fun side of it.<p>And the few times this ""unpaid phone bill"" joke didn't get me the number, the woman was polite with something like: ""sorry, it's too soon. I'm just not comfortable giving my number to a guy on the internet yet."" Which is absolutely fine.<p>I know what this looks like (I'm an a-hole), but I also know how women generally respond to this stuff; I have empirical evidence that shows a strong correlation of success. Her response was not normal and pretty low-class, and really left me blindsided. She did say some pretty ridiculous stuff that wouldn't even be true of a dog with down syndrome. Quite unbalanced, even if you read my message at face value: with no evidence other than her not giving me the number, I was asserting she couldn't pay her phone bill on time, and that I was willing to share some of my raman.<p>Besides, I had never met a person who didn't think raman was funny in itself. Who hasn't lived off it for a few days? It's like an inside joke we all share.<p>I'm not going to abandon everything that actually works because one person got offended. It has worked before, and it is very likely that it'll work another 50 times before I come across someone who is even mildly offended by my general manner.<p>Also, and I feel really bad mentioning this, she is one of the lesser looking girls I've spoken to with intentions of dating. I'm starting to think the whole thing was because she had less experience with jolly bantering. But, this may be me unjustly rationalizing.<p>Thank god for nested comments. <i>Waaaayyyy</i> off topic.",1270157170

No one is saying that people will spend the same amount of time they do watching TV now watching crappy youtube clips. It's that maybe, there just isn't a market for the kind of entertainment Dancing with the Stars represents - it's just becoming too expensive. I'm not sure that's true, but I do think the market for traditional TV/entertainment in general is shrinking. That, I think, is the core argument: That maybe, there is no way to answer the question ""so, how do we continue making this much money?"" without letting people down. Perhaps there is no way for these big organisations to make all their money doing what they do. Perhaps people like the guy who posted ""Charlie bit my finger"" will find some way of monetizing that, in small scales. Perhaps not.<p>The thing that people don't like to hear is that things change. So maybe the days of entertainment are over, maybe no one can work in show business, maybe copying that floppy really killed the radio star - yes, maybe.
