If you're trying to persuade a lot of people, it's almost always better to choose the easier and more readable word instead of the bigger or deeper or more obscure word.<p>I read a hell of a lot, and I had to look bilge up to figure out exactly what you're saying - you could've just said ""trash"" instead and everyone would've got your meaning. Likewise, ""tedious"" could be ""boring"", ""smugly belittle"" could be ""insult"", you could drop ""endlessly"" altogether since it doesn't add any more information. Likewise, ""quite enough"" doesn't convey more than just the word ""enough"", ""nuanced grasp of reality"" could've just been ""perspective"". Here's how I'd write it:<p>> Few things are more tedious than reading science majors endlessly, smugly belittle arts subjects. ""Oh ho ho, something I don't understand and haven't done and probably couldn't do, they must be idiots, let's constantly mock them"". I saw quite enough of that on slashdot so was very disappointed to see this sort of bilge get so many upvotes here.

It's easier to mock something than it is to try to understand it. Sheesh, I saw enough of that on slashdot and I'm disappointed to see it here. It's good that at least a few commentors are taking the time to share a perspective from the other side.<p>So, you write less, it's faster, more people understand you, more are convinced, and you come across less arrogant.

A startup is entrepreneurship. 
So the next question would be: is this model which I've ""entrepreneured"" sustainable? Will it continue to grow?<p>To sum it up, I would say that 'entrepreneurship is act of creating a profitable business - where as intrepreneurship is the act of maintaining it'.
