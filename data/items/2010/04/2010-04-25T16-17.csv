But I was not convinced that Mark's hiring filter was the correct approach to hiring. As an entrepreneur you're the underdog and need to find ways to do more with less. If all the big name companies are afraid of job hoppers, then you should be looking even harder at job hoppers. Your best chance at finding that diamond-in-the-rough employee is to take a closer look at the applicants that were never really evaluated at other companies because they were ""caught by the filter.""",1272214473

I know they are abused horrifically at times, but if the accusations being made here are true, I can't even begin to call this an abuse of a child porn law. I can imagine a world in which someone could think this is a good idea without thinking through all the implications, but at the first picture of someone (anyone, child or otherwise) in an even remotely compromising position that landed on the school's drives, the sane, sensible, and basically legally-mandated thing to do would have been to immediately terminate the program. They failed this test and it is perfectly just that they be prosecuted. Deterrence is a perfectly reasonable motive here; we absolutely do not want anyone to think this is a reasonable solution to any problem.<p>Save your objections for the <i>actual</i> abuses, lest you dilute your argument. (Assuming that is what you are trying to imply. Which isn't clear, though I'm not sure what else you could mean.)<p>(Edit: In other posts you talk about intent. As I argued above, if intent had been pure the program would have shut down at the first sign of trouble.

1292970,comment,1291613,1292905,0,0,elblanco,,,"I suppose Apple at the time was assuming that people would just craft web apps. Except that the web of the time wasn't ready and they were forced to open up to be viable (there were half a dozen phones out at the time that could surf the web for less than the $500 Apple original charged for the iPhone).<p>> From where I sit, they gave an inch, and the peanut gallery is demanding a mile.<p>I think Apple would have been better served following a model more closely in line with video game consoles. Instead they tried for a hybrid open platform/licensed developer model (with centralized distribution of the channel). It's a very interesting approach that seems to have worked in terms of developing a large volume of apps and a robust ecosystem of development tools. But it's always seemed to me that what they really wanted was a Nintendo model, because that's how they seem to be behaving. I'm wondering how much Job's distaste for the gaming market figured into the current hybrid model rather than just doing a console licensing model from the start.<p>Not many people complain too loudly about the centralized distribution platform (Nintendo only cartridges), it seems to work pretty well. And until recently, nobody really complained about developing for the platform outside of the app approval process being irreparably broken, but that's not too different from the console model either (Nintendo Seal of Quality). Other things are representative of the console model, profit sharing (licensing costs), by saying ""you must use this tool chain"" it's not any different then having to use a certain dev kit and starts down the path of approving certain 3rd party development houses for the platforms instead of any ol' body. All Apple has to do is check that last box and they've pretty much managed to recreate the Nintendo licensing model from the 80's and 90's.<p>I'm not saying it's bad, it was extremely profitable for Nintendo, kept the quality reasonably high (unlicensed games for the NES pretty much blow donkey balls). It's just that they should call the model they are using the model they are using. Maybe they are, but most developers seem to be under the mindset that Apple is not following this model and that there is some hope that if they just pull enough the other way, the iP* platforms will open up like Androids.",1272213225

He spent the first 8 years of his career at Accenture (which screams failed attempt at making partner -- sorry to be harsh), but drastically changed occupations every two years inside the firm (switching from IT to strategy, changing countries etc.).<p>I really like reading Mark, so I'm afraid of overbearing my point. But his inital blog post sounded like shamelessly getting his cake and eating it too.<p>He felt that such frequent career changes were the best way to prepare himself to lead a startup someday -- why would the same trait magically become a liability in others? Optimizing against this very behavior in job selection signals a quite detrimental two-tiered mindset -- himself at the helm, and employees who are there to take orders.<p>This is to some extent the reality of capitalism, but it isn't admirable leadership, nor a good way to generate innovation, and certainly not the best way to inspire people to stick on a sinking ship while the rats drown away.

I've worked with Plan 9 for several years now.

I assume in the context of what's going on with the SEC, it's more appealing now.<p>That being said, this article -- like most of Taibbi's -- is a well-written, entertaining narrative that sews together selective elements to construct something plausible. Go one step further by looking at the environments of each ""bubble"" to get a less filtered context -- what other companies were doing, what economic forecasters were saying, etc -- and it falls apart quickly.<p>Goldman Sachs is a company comprised of smart people. Sometimes elements of the company get involved in shaddy things. That happens everywhere -- finance, government, gumball manufacturers.<p>Interestingly, John Galbraith's chronicle of the crash of '29, did detail perhaps the most egregious of the young company's offenses. He also said: <i>Our political tradition sets great store by the generalized symbol of evil. This is the wrongdoer whose wrongdoing will be taken by the public to be the secret propensity of a whole community or class. We search avidly for such people, not so much because we wish to see them exposed and punished as individuals, but because we cherish the resulting political discomfort of their friends. To uncover an evil man among the friends of one's foes had long been a recognized method of advancing one's political fortunes. However, in recent times the technique has been greatly improved and refined by the added firmness with which the evil of the evildoer is now attributed to friends, acquaintances, and all who share his way of life.</i>",1272211443

I would strongly recommend that you exhaust your local market (the one that you know and understand infinitely better), before you think about expanding abroad.<p>I'm speaking from my own experience. My first start-up was a tutoring / language instruction tool. The biggest market in the world for this is in South Korea, so we tried to launch there first. Big mistake. A few specific problems:<p>1) It's really hard to evaluate a) how good a foreign salesperson is, and b) how well they know the local market. Think about it. Most of sales relies on subtle, cultural cues (body language, slight intonations, really specific language), and it's difficult to gauge this. Much more importantly, though, anyone can tell you ""oh yeah, I understand my local market in X space,"" and this is really hard to evaluate if you're not from/in that place.<p>2) Localizing is hard. Even if you hire coders and designers from the place you're trying to get into, again, evaluating their work is hard. Their work might look awesome to you (if you get lucky), but the viewing public of your launch market might think it looks terrible.<p>3) Your service probably has great applications around you that you haven't even thought of. For us, our workforce of smart, college-age language teachers, were equally suited for tutoring and and college counseling in the US as they were for teaching English to students in Korea. And the big difference was, we knew the US market infinitely better.<p>These are just things I found to be true in my own experience, but if you want to launch in foreign markets, then good luck and all the power to you.<p>If you do, the one piece of advice I would definitely give you is to find a local partner (someone who has YOUR interests in mind, whether through equity, etc.) and use that person to fill out your team/vet your talent there.
