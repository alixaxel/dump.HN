It has also been in development for at least 5 years.<p>I don't get why people get version numbers so literally. Perl6 is a new language inspired by Perl5. Python 3 is just a minor enhancement that happens to break backwards-compatibility. The two are not comparable.",1272052793

(And if your business is publishing folks' info, that is probably true.  Heck, everybody on the Internet who takes credit cards, in any capacity, has a built-in ""Are they going to scam me?"" objection to address.)<p>Culturally, in Japan, the title for the CEO (often) literally means ""Person With The Highest Responsibility.""  (最高責任者 -- all the other CXOs are ""Person with the Highest Responsibility For [Information, etc]"")  Within the company, I'm sure some junior engineer is going to get a royal chewout today, but to the rest of the world, the company is an impenetrable mass.  When an employee screws up, the company has screwed up, and when the company screws up, the CEO (or division chief or whomever) apologizes because his job is managing the business such that it does not screw up.<p><i>When done well</i>, I think this is one of the most emulation-worthy bits of the Japanese corporate culture.

(You can't do an a/b test to determine whether people quit your app in 2 weeks or 3 if you're only getting 100 new signups a day, at least not in any reasonable timeframe).<p>So first you knock the easy virality stuff out. Do my users have good reasons to invite friends? Is it easy enough to do so, and is the invite messaging sufficiently attractive? Can I squeeze some more wall posts in here somewhere, and make the ones I have more attractive to non-users?<p>Then move on to the easy engagement stuff. Do I have solid daily return incentives?

(I got downvoted as far as each comment could go during that debate thank you very much)<p> 
But this offer makes me realize an important point I didn’t make in that debate: If he is fired this guy’s best chance at getting a new job is BECAUSE Gizmodo revealed his name.  Just like with this beer offer sympathy for him actually creates benefits.  Had Gizmodo not revealed his name he’d just be a guy who was fired for incompetence which doesn’t look good on the resume.  Now at least his story has been told.<p> 
Don’t misunderstand me.  I’m not arguing that the good will outweigh the bad for him because I simply don’t know.  What I am arguing is that it’s a reporters job to report the truth and the reason they shouldn’t start censoring details based on their own preferences is because they can’t foresee what the consequences of such an action would be (good or bad)

1289177,comment,1288746,1288931,0,0,cwp,,,"To relate this back to the blog post, the original sin is that Python has too much syntax. Every time somebody wants to add a ""language"" feature, it has to be implemented with some kind of syntactic change, and support for the semantics of the feature has to be added to the interpreter. That's a lot of work, and it means that alternate implementations like Jython can't keep up.<p>A good example of this is generators. Via PEP 255 they were introduced in Python 2.2, and required the addition of the ""yield"" statement to the syntax. Recently Squeak (an open-source Smalltalk implementation) added generators to the standard library, with no syntax changes required. It was a <i>much</i> smaller project, and the change can easily be ported to other Smalltalk implementations without participation from the maintainers of the core libraries or virtual machine.<p>So languages with very simple syntax, like Smalltalk and Lisp just don't suffer from the high level of language evolution friction that Python does. In practice, the diversity of dialects and the ease with which the language can change creates the kind of market system of language features that andreyf mentioned here on HN.<p>The neat thing about Perl6 is that it takes a different approach. Perl doesn't have a simple syntax like Smalltalk or Lisp. Instead it has a very powerful system for text manipulation that can handle the complexity of Perl's syntax. In theory, that's even more powerful than Lisp macros or Smalltalk's implemented-in-Smalltalk compiler. It'll be very interesting to see how it plays out in practice.",1272049648
