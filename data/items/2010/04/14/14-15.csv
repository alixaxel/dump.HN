Perhaps it's different in this case, but most companies, particularly ones funded with 33 million dollars, make decisions based on business and what will eventually lead towards making actual moola. Theirs is not a charity case. Engineerig efforts there are not acts of chivalry.

It's easy to observe: I have colleagues who don't know currying and lambdas, others who don't find them useful, and others who plainly don't get it. <i>Programmers.</i> I doubt such blindness applies to physical tools. But that may be because I'm not proficient in manual works.<p>That said, even if I am wrong, ""languages are just tools"" is still harmful. This phrase is often followed by statements like ""the choice of languages don't matter that much"", or ""don't whine about your language"". These are valid to the extent you have to take into account existing code (read: past mistakes), and team expertise (read: ignorance). However, they tend to overstate these issues.
