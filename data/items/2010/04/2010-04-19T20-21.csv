An accrual system does not, as the inference is there that you will chase them to pay.<p>Having been in both situations, I disagree with this summary.<p>You write down the bad debt in the situation of the unpaid AR in accrual, in cash, you close the invoice however you wish to do so. It's not like you stop tracking invoices in cash based accounting or who owes you money.<p>The real big deal between accrual and cash is ""control of large expense timelines"" which you can pick which date you add them in when doing accrual, and you can't when you do cash.  If you do a lot of business that falls over the end of your fiscal year (not a problem in my part of the woods) this can be an issue.<p>Most of the rest of the changes are just changes in amount of paperwork.",1271710240

In our case, all data is scraped from the INE website (<a href=""http://www.ine.es/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ine.es/</a>), but there's one single data which couldn't be obtained from any official source in a programmatical way, one that is essential: the mapping between official districts number and the district name.

Apple makes money from App Store sales ($27M to $170M per quarter according to various estimates found on Google) which, while small compared to total revenue, is non-trivial. Also, paid apps tend to be higher quality, and it is strongly in Apple's best interest to maintain a high quality standard in the App Store. If Apple suddenly makes it hard for developers to make money, as the article insinuates, then they will deal with a larger percentage of low quality app submissions because it isn't worth the time to make high-end apps.",1271710028
1277804,comment,1277459,1277459,0,0,Dove,,,"No incremental testing strikes me as a rather valueless constraint.  Small experiments are one of the most crucial skills -- if not <i>the</i> crucial skill -- in writing correct code.  It's like asking me to swim with one arm tied behind my back to see if I am a good swimmer.<p>Sure, I can run these 'tests' on scratch paper or even in my head, if you require me to.  But real life never requires this.  I prefer to prove to myself that each piece of an algorithm is correct--using a combination of reasoning and microtesting--before moving on to the next.  Why would I waste attention doing this all in my head?  The computer will do many pieces of it for me quickly, accurately, in a way that catches language idiosyncracies, and most importantly frees my attention for considering more abstract errors.<p>Edit: I had to try anyway, and (as far as I can tell) I <i>was</i> able to do it correctly in about three minutes.  But I suspect it has less to do with native programming ability and more to do with having written dozens of variants on binary searches in the past year (I've had reason to want to handle various types of fuzzy matches, filtering and desired multiplicities in return values).  FWIW, even after a fairly exhaustive suite of random input tests, I trust this binary search I have just written far less than the many I've recently written using my usual incremental methodology.  Were I to include this in an actual release, I would not attempt to prove what I just wrote correct.  I would destroy it and do the job properly from scratch.<p>Which rather underscores my point.  I just wrote some code the wrong way, and even in spite of quite a lot of recent domain experience, a pretty good test suite, and a lot of staring at it and thinking about it . . . <i>I don't trust it because I didn't test the pieces while I was writing it</i>.",1271710026

I almost always get stuff like this wrong when I implement it. My code breaks for empty lists, or with just one element, or lists with an odd number of elements, or something else I can't imagine.<p>Exposure to recursive algorithms has taught me to build this kind of thing up from simple cases like an empty list or a list with one element.

It boosted our traffic levels significantly for around a week and the conversion rates from the referring blogs were extremely high.  I'm attributing the high conversion rates to the fact that after someone read a review about our app, they wanted to come to our site and try it.  So before they even became a 'user' the conversion was already there, just waiting to be registered.<p>So lets say we had 100 users reading one of our mentions on a blog that click through to our site to give the app a try...Does the download button or headline of the landing page (which we are A/B testing) really matter that much at this point? These users had a pretty clear goal of trying our app.
The conversion rates from these visitors were around 75-85% across about 10 blogs (about 4,000 visitors in total).
The app has no registration or credit card required barriers.  The only requirement is that the user needs to have Firefox (which all of the blogs clearly mentioned before sending the users).<p>So should I be making judgment calls about the most effective headline or the color of the download button?  Or should I just throw away this data and look at other traffic sources before making the decision of which headline to set as the next control?",1271707548

In both cases the core products are pretty much the entire profit for these companies. This is hardly for lack of trying, they have both launched dozens to hundreds of other products (and have tons of money to back them up), but have so far been unable to replicate the success.<p>It's not just technology either: Peter Lynch (a successful fund manager) coined the term ""ten bagger"" for a stock investment that increases tenfold in value. According to Lynch, ten baggers were incredibly satisfying and incredibly hard to find. (As I recall it from his book, the fund invested in hundreds of companies each year and there was still years between each ten bagger. In that perspective, one major success out of 40 seems pretty good.)<p>I guess it mostly goes to show that mountains of money tend not to lie around for the taking :)",1271707482
