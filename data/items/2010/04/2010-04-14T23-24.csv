1266514,comment,1266168,1266168,0,0,sielskr,,,"I've installed and played around with p9p (Plan 9 Port, aka, Plan 9 from User Space) and 9vx, but never managed to get the text to render acceptably.   (If any of you have seen the text in Emacs over X11 before the integration with GTK+ or whatever in Emacs 23, it was at least as bad as that.)  I tried 2 third-party ""softwares"" (hacks on p9p) which aimed to do text smoothing, but no joy.  I might have tried to get used to it, but I believe I would never be able to get used to switching back and forth many time per hour between p9p's or 9vx's text and the text in graphical browser on Linux, OS X or Windows.<p>In general, I do best when all the text I view during a session at the computer is rendered by a single system, like Aqua or Gnome/GTK.  My visual system is defective (exotropia and ""lazy eye"") but not so much that I have any restrictions on my driver's license.  I can read 12-point text on OS X (and probably 10-point text, too), but when a system can handle it without complicating my life, like Carbon Emacs 22 can, I prefer 18-point text, and part of the reason that I do is probably that there is more visual information per character.  (I'm a little far-sighted, and my head is usually 4'-5' from the monitor.)",1271289508

About the only semi-useful metric they track is the sprint times, but even that isn't very useful because the researchers didn't have a third phase of the study where the women were asked to decrease their sleep back to stage 1 amounts. Having a third stage would help control for performance increase due to practice time. The other metrics they track are highly variable in a sport such as tennis because players can put speeds and spins on the ball to affect the outcome. To control for this, you'd probably have to track a player's performance in a series of matches against the same opponent in addition to having a stage 3 like I described above. Still, tennis is more skill-based and less fitness-based compared to other sports like running, so I think it would be hard to draw conclusions from a study like this.",1271287947

1266412,comment,1265373,1266161,0,0,lmkg,,,"For me, the point worth arguing is not whether infix vs prefix arithmetic is hard, but that ""actual programs"" get harder. They don't: Math, logical operations, and variable assignment are the hardest to switch over to thinking Lisply, because those are the operations normally represented as binary operators in other languages[1]. Lisp and other languages share the same prefix notation for standard function calls. When you start moving into ""actual"" programs from toy examples, functions become a bigger chunk of the program, and the lack of infix operators becomes a smaller deal.<p>I wonder if intro-to-lisp books should shy away from arithmetic in the first few chapters to avoid this stumbling block. It seems odd to introduce the nature of lisp syntax by focusing on its weakest point. Shuffling lists of symbols around gives an introduction to the syntax and the more fundamental data types, and makes for an easier segue into macros.<p>[1] Variable assignment is the easiest to overcome, because you simply doesn't use variable assignment as much in Lisp, and in this sense the aversion is a good thing as working to avoid it helps produce more idiomatic code. Logical operators are also easier to overcome because in practice it's not common to have thorny expressions with high nesting levels like you can in arithmetic.<p>I wonder if it would be worthwhile to have a MATH special form in common lisp that that allows for special evaluation in its body, like how the LOOP form parses its arguments.",1271286725

Just some thoughts for the sake of discussion:<p>- Maybe if money was invested in better work conditions, other factories with worse work conditions would be cheaper and get all the business. If that is the case, it might actually work to go for ""green labels"" on clothes, so that only factories with good working conditions get business (not sure if such labels exist yet or how feasible they would be).<p>- Still I think it has to be considered why people still work in these bad conditions. I don't think it is simply lack of unions. I am not in a union, yet working conditions for software developers seem fair. I assume that is because software developers are still in high demand.
