Thinking that they do presumes that A) there's an organized political arm of the SEC and B)  said political arm is simultaneously smart enough to know about a report like this weeks ahead of time and dumb enough to misjudge this situation massively, damaging their brand worse by launching a bogus lawsuit to distract from a total non-story.<p>A defendant in a major lawsuit, on the other hand, <i>absolutely</i> has an incentive to try and turn the tables by virtue of something like this.  The two are not equivalent.<p>EDIT:  To clear up my point, I'd have absolutely no problem believing that part of the timing of the lawsuit was pushed by the administration to support the financial reform currently before Congress.  That's an incentive that makes sense.  ""Oh no we were whacking it"" does not.",1272056282

1289455,comment,1289186,1289186,0,0,spacecow,,,"I think Zed is being disingenuous (or just plain not reading anything that isn't code on the Dive Into Python site).  One of his main points is that Dive Into Python is bad because it's supposed to be for beginners, and makes Python seem to complicated.  But, here's the <i>first sentence</i> on the front page of diveintopython.org:<p>""Dive Into Python is a Python book for experienced programmers.""<p>Not beginners.  Zed's ""I could see if Mr. Pilgrim had a giant disclaimer or something warning people that this isn't a beginner's book, but he doesn't."" is totally unfounded.<p>Zed also laments that the first example requires readers to ""suddenly comprehend"" a bunch of random language features.  But <i>right above</i> the example he links to:<p>""It probably makes absolutely no sense to you. Don't worry about that, because you're going to dissect it line by line. But read through it first and see what, if anything, you can make of it.""<p>(I will totally agree that the example program is at best uninteresting and at worst confusing, but you don't need to know anything about ODBC to understand it.  I certainly didn't when I first read Dive Into Python.)<p>Zed's brand of hyperbolic vitriol has never sat particularly well with me, but this article in particular sounds like he just has an ax to grind with Pilgrim.  He certainly spends almost no time actually discussing how the book has poor design decisions, or why it is ""weird,"" or what instructions are hard to follow, or what expert needs it is not fulfilling.  There's almost no substance whatsoever here, just sanctimonious character assassination.  I will never understand why this guy has an audience.",1272056197
1289454,comment,1287110,1288623,0,0,logic,,,"A prior employer looked good on paper, and on Google; in fact, I went into the interviewing process very skeptical of their industry in general, and came away with a surprisingly positive vibe about the organization and what they were trying to do. The employees I spoke with were top-caliber folks; asked smart questions, and had good answers for me as well. The interview with the owners was fairly typical and high-level, nothing out of the ordinary.<p>So, I came aboard. The principals had just left for an extended sabbatical (they departed shortly after I interviewed with them). Morale seemed excellent when I started, and there was a great deal of interesting work to be done. When they returned, the mood changed very quickly, and it didn't take long to understand why.<p>I spent enough time there to do some interesting things, and help them over a knowledge slump during an infrastructure forklift, but it quickly became apparent that the owners and I had different ideas about how people should be treated, and how businesses should conduct themselves. My personal google-fu failed me on this one.<p>I showed myself the door to take a position that I would have never otherwise considered taking, knowing full well how that would look on a resume, but also knowing I didn't want to continue contributing to their bottom line.<p>(I have a few items on my resume I do not enjoy discussing in an interview, and I've had to add this one to the list: being vague or evasive suggests you're hiding something, but any real explanation just invites the idea that you're the kind of guy who doesn't work well with others.

Our access and ability to publish on the web is controlled by a few large companies with some regulation by the government.  Even if the Semantic Web takes off, I can't imagine that most people will be consuming that data autonomously.  On the contrary, there will likely only be a few significant players be they browser producers or otherwise converting that information to be relevant to users, thus it won't really be the federated utopia so often espoused by the Semantic Web pundits.  But hey, maybe I'm a pessimist.

They try to do stuff to ""help me"", get it wrong, and then make me do more work as a result.<p>I've fucked over my Debian unstable system more times than I can count over the last 10 years... but it's never annoyed me much.  On the other hand, my Windows, OS X, and Ubuntu machine annoy the living fuck out of me every time they say ""updates installed, you must restart"".<p>I guess I hate sitting down to use a computer and having it tell me, ""sorry, I did stuff without your asking, now you need to clean up the mess"".  I still haven't fixed the nvidia driver on my Thinkpad with Unbuntu.  I tried, failed, and just put the machine in a closet somewhere.  It worked a few times, but now I can't get it to work, and I don't know what steps to take.  Everything is so magical, and all I can do is be helpless.<p>With Debian, I make the mess myself, so when I have to clean it up, I am already in the mood.  (And of course, the nvidia driver works perfectly.  Yeah, I had to build it with module-assistant.  But that <i>always works</i>!  Every step in the process exists for a good and logical reason -- there is no magic.  And magic is what makes me mad.)",1272052817
