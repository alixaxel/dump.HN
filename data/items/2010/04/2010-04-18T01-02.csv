But if you manage to actually have a number of planes flying internationally, I'd imagine you should have enough money in reserve to support the company for a month without much income (also, people are still buying tickets for the following months). It was not even a week so far - that's probably comparable to the number of flights stopped every year because of snow. Should I seriously believe that they don't plan for those kinds of events?",1271555793

1274138,comment,1273241,1273459,0,0,memetichazard,,,"<i>One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite a immersive game without points or rules, but I would say then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them.</i><p>Ebert tries to set up definitions in a way such that games and art are mutually exclusive. That is, that the difference between art and games in the interactivity, the ability to affect the art itself. I disagree. Much like a tree falling in the woods, can a piece of art that is not seen, or not heard, or not read, or not watched, be considered an art? Therefore, it is necessary to concede at least the minimal level of interaction, between that of the person and the art. Then, why does further interaction, that of the participant being able to effect the world presented by the game, remove a game's ability to be art?<p>Second, the point has been made that the participant's interaction with the game is not that of one who wants to interact with it as 'art'. Well, if I were to use any famous painting, say, the Mona Lisa, as toilet paper, does that make it not art? (Well, maybe after I've made use of it...)<p>To conclude, here are some games that I consider to be art.  
There are the various art games that indie producers have made. Jason Rohrer has made many such games - in particular Passage and Gravitation. (I also saw Sleep is Death on the front page of HN a few days ago). No points, no rules, maybe an objective, so perhaps Ebert wouldn't consider those to be games. 'The Path' is another such art game, though again perhaps Ebert might not consider it to be a game.  
There are various RPGs that are particularly story intensive. In fact, a common complaint seems to be that there's too much cinematics and story and not enough gameplay.  
Finally, I consider the game 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time' to be art. Maybe not its sequels though.",1271555169

1274132,comment,1274013,1274013,0,0,jim-greer,,,"There's a lot of validity to this argument, but Farmville is not unique. If you take his criteria and replace Farmville with World of Warcraft, most of it still holds:<p><i>(1) WoW is defined by obligation, routine, and responsibility;</i><p><i>(2) WoW encroaches and depends upon real life, and is never entirely separate from it;</i><p><i>(3) WoW is always certain in outcome, and involves neither chance nor skill;</i><p><i>(4) WoW is a productive activity, in that it adds to the social capital upon which Blizzard and Activision depend for their wealth;</i><p><i>(5) WoW is governed not by rules, but by habits, and simple 
cause-and-effect;</i><p><i>(6) WoW is not make-believe, in that it requires neither immersion nor suspension of disbelief.</i><p>WoW does require more skill. And it is governed by rules not 'simple cause and effect' - but so is Farmville. WoW is also more immersive.<p>These differences are what make it a 'better' game to most gamers. But they don't change what the OP finds sociopathic about the game, namely that they're <i>applications that use people’s sociability to control those people, and to satisfy their owners’ needs</i>.<p>It is much more controlling, it just reaches a narrower audience. It is also equally social - the social interactions are arguably deeper and more meaningful, in fact.<p>I say this as someone who works in the field of online games (I run Kongregate). I do think the feeling of accomplishment and social satisfaction provided by games are powerful, and not totally positive. I also hope that the positive aspects of online game communities balance this out to some degree.<p>Edit: WoW succeeded in a competitive field largely on quality (and massive capital outlay). Farmville succeeded through the hyper-fast and skillful application of the A/B-testing 'lean startup' techniques widely admired and practiced by most readers of this site.
