This is an absurd position, akin to saying that talking as you walk down the street is like being a broadcaster because others can hear. He then goes on to say there should be federal shield law; a reasonable request on its face, but not if it's going to apply to every random posting on the internet.<p>It's been cited in relation to the Gizmodo flap, but to be honest i can't see the relevance.

Thank goodness they finally came to one that is an open standard. Of course most places ditched the quicktime wrapper at the same time so it is moot.<p>The missing piece, which I don't understand, is why does no one sell a cheap H.264 decoder for Linux/*BSD? There are free (beer) implementations, and the MPEG-LA suggests that the first many thousands are no royalty and after that it is something under a dollar (I didn't look that up, working from memory). So why not a business selling legally licensed but open source H.264 to the free software crowd for $3 a pop?",1272607160

Most of the remainder are founded by doing something useless (Twitter, Facebook, del.icio.us, Reddit, etc.)  This is for very good reason.  If something is neither useless nor impossible, it's quite probable that there's a big company out there that's already working on it, and they can bring more resources to bear than you can.<p>So if you <i>are</i> the entrepreneur and not merely working for him, it's your job to do the impossible.  And yeah, that means turning it into the merely hard and then doing it.  But if you aim for ""merely hard"" to begin with, you'll probably end up producing a mediocre product in the end.

Especially in the case of Apple, my believe is that 90% of their sales are accomplished by excellent marketing. This Blogpost is just another move. I think we can agree that, when looking at hard facts, Steve is plainly lying to his customers in a lot of points.\nMe, as the nerd i am, can look at some facts and behind the words of that letter.\nThe most sad and disappointing fact on the hand is, that most users will take the letter for granted. Steve writes as if all the things are facts, true and _many_ people will just believe him! He will sell even more units and from today on Apple customers will looks at me, disturbed, why i have Flash on my Phone/Tablet, that it will only drain the batteries, bla bla bla.\nThis is basically what really makes me angry about this.\nHe could have just written ""we are not allowing Flash because we want to protect the Appstore"". Everyone would understand, that's the fact, ok. But no. He wrote together a big pile of lies.",1272604545
