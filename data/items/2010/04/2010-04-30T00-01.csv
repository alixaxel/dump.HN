In the history of civilization, the ebb and flow of empires has always consisted of tax disputes wedging factions into alliances who fight for more control. Taxes cause this process! It doesn't matter what the tax is, who pays, or who is paid, just that there's all this extra drain on the natural activity of flowing capital.<p>The logic is Microecon 101: Taxes are the equivalent to the a transaction+holding cost of using Uncle Sam's currency. Use gold, well,
then you're paying to store and transport it. If Uncle Sam was smart about his paper, he would make the Federal Reserve into Federal PayPal, having the Federal Gov't charge, oh say, a 0.001% transaction fee on any exchange of US currency. Same difference, amirite?",1272589176

This requires sending load confirmation and bill of lading documents that they must have with them in the truck.<p>Many of these barely have a working fax machine, much less email. We email documents directly whenever we can, and have abstracted faxing away using a print-to-fax server, and incoming faxes to emails.

Day by day people disliked it more and more and everyone involved wanted to get it off the TV as soon as possible.  When a bill is more popular there is less thrashing.  People don't need to desperately alter things to appease individual politicians.  Each of those patches is essentially a hack to cover one corner case.  This bill is full of them.  Popularity equates to a more stable code base.  Politicians are also more productive when doing something popular.  They are less likely to ""grab what they can"" and more likely to contribute to the bill's success and thus their re-election.<p>We've all been there...

In fact, it probably wouldn't be there at all, because the person writing it would sense that something was a level-one trait or a level-three trait. But when you start down the path of bullshit like this, you find yourself in the land of arbitrariness, and pretty soon you're just desperate for some more words to fill up the boxes.<p>And it is, indeed, bullshit. A good sense of humor is important in the workplace, as it is everywhere, but it's not something that can be assessed in some abstract way like this, separate from the person's other qualities.",1272585961

Adobe need to come up with it's own version of mobile phone :) in the post Steve Jobs mentioned not to encourage the third party layer.... so they ll be slow to adapt the platform changes....

We're in the business of making products, and there's no way most people are going to waste their time adding tons of browser-specific features.<p>The fact that the browsers don't have parity is probably the most time-consuming thing about web development.",1272585900
