I think it's more that people tend to derive pleasure from one or two ""must haves"" about the place they live, but don't care much about the rest.  If those ""must haves"" don't align with what <i>you</i> value, it looks irrational, but it's perfectly rational to <i>them</i>.<p>Personally, I can't stand living in a place that doesn't look out over greenery.  I find I'm so much calmer and get more done when I can come home to a place with grass and trees and bushes, so I'm willing to pay a few hundred dollars a month extra for that.<p>I find it similarly irrational to think of all the people that can't live anywhere but the city.  I mean, they pay <i>more</i> than I do, <i>and</i> they have to live with roommates, <i>and</i> their places are usually smaller, <i>and</i> they have to specifically go somewhere else for greenery, <i>and</i> they're looking at an hour commute.  (I'm particularly perplexed by people who spend $5k/month to live in Manhattan, which is like SF * 10 in terms of all that overstimulation and has less charm to boot.)  But over time, I've realized that these people aren't <i>stupid</i>, they just have different priorities from me.  Some absolutely love having lots of small ethnic restaurants on their block.  Some enjoy having most of their friends within walking distance (which admittedly would be pretty nice).  Some like to go out clubbing every night, and there're lots more opportunities for that in the city.  They aren't opportunities that particularly matter to me, which is why <i>I</i> wouldn't make those trade-offs.  But they matter to the people in question.",1271655735

San Francisco is a right bastard to get around since the various districts are spread out and separated by huge hills. Portland is easily walkable.<p>2. San Francisco has slow, dirty, overpriced public transport. Portland has a convenient light rail system which is free in the downtown core area, and drops you right at the airport for a buck fifty.<p>3. San Francisco is filthy. Portland is clean. San Francisco has aggressive panhandlers and crazy people everywhere, Portland somehow keeps most of 'em out.<p>4. San Francisco is insanely expensive and only those earning multi-hundred-K a year can afford to actually buy there. Portland is nice and cheap.<p>5. San Francisco has great scenery which is spoiled by tourists. Portland has perfectly adequate scenery which isn't.<p>Another nice thing: no sales tax. That means that you wind up paying what it says on the label and don't have to do the ""compute in head and fumble with loose change"" thing.

The Mac never had a <i>chance</i> of catching up in sheer market share numbers.<p>With the iPhone (and iPad), the story is the opposite: there wasn't any mainstream (i.e. ""household name"") smartphone on the market at the time the iPhone was introduced. The App Store has a wide early lead in terms of number of apps. Likewise, there hasn't been a mainstream tablet like the iPad seems set to be.<p><i>""Where developers went, consumers soon followed.""</i><p>Is this really the case? I see this sort of thing being said very often these days, but I'm not convinced it's accurate. (Always be suspicious of a group telling itself how important and influential it is!)<p>Windows took over because PCs running DOS were already vastly dominant. Hardware manufacturers and users of course wanted GUIs and Microsoft made sure Windows was cheaply available as part of the (restrictive and exclusive) licenses the hardware companies already had for MS-DOS — I remember hearing that IBM's hardware division could get MS-DOS/Windows cheaper than they could get IBM OS/2 from their own software division! And Windows had much more mainstream resource requirements compared to OS/2, its only real competitor on the PC desktop. So every PC very quickly started to ship with Windows. The Mac was already confined to a niche, Windows just narrowed it further. Users ended up  in a situation where they would have had to have gone far out of their way to get a PC that <i>didn't</i> have Windows, so of course there quickly was demand for Windows apps.<p>Also, while the PC was widely used at home, it also had the advantage of being even more widely used in business. So people decided to buy a PC at home because they were compatible (disk and document formats, not to mention being able to bring home software from work) and were already familiar with the PC. The same sort of compatibility lock-in doesn't exist in today's mobile space (if anything, there are a ton of apps on iPhone OS that people want and can't get anywhere else); and I don't see many people buying Blackberrys because they're already familiar with them from work. (More like they buy iPhones because they're already familiar with their iPod ... and iPads because they're already familiar with their iPhone.)",1271653539

1276101,comment,1274911,1276077,0,0,macrael,,,"Who indeed? OS/2 is a prime example of what can happen to a hardware company that puts its destiny in the hands of another. IBM got screwed by Microsoft when they pulled out of OS/2. If IBM had their own OS independent of Microsoft, they wouldn't necessarily have had the same problem. Also, the HUGE difference between now and then is that today we have the internet. Incompatibility was a huge problem back then because if you had two people with different OS's, you couldn't share anything, let alone run the same programs. With the web as an intermediary, we have a much better way to share information than we did back then.<p>Ex: Even if the same app doesn't run on two different OS's, they can both still talk to twitter. Back in the day, if you both didn't have a copy of Word, (and floppy drives) you couldn't share data.<p>Also, re: why would anyone want to do this, my answer to that is that if they have something different from everyone else who is competing on who can sell the cheapest Android phone, they would have something to sell.",1271653450
