Judging by the OP's question, and that he seems to be a bit ""out of it"" generally speaking, I don't think getting married at this point in time is the best idea, especially when he's so young.  Marriage is the most important decision you'll make in your life, and speaking from the man's side of it, you should likely anticipate serious modifications to the formerly implicit agreements decided upon before marriage....just fair warning.",1270645168

Other than CSPAN, FOX is the only network news channel that even attempts to balance its news shows with opposite points of view.
I was watching Chris Matthews last night as he interviewed two people about some stupid subject.....including Matthews all three of those guys completely agreed with each other about what they were discussing and it was, of course, the leftist viewpoint.
If you turn on FOX news shows they always have someone, whether it is Juan Williams or Mara Liasson of NPR fame or other liberal commentators on their Sunday Business News show to ""balance out"" their own conservatives.
Yes, Beck is outrageous but what about that maniac Keith Olberman over at MSNBC?  The problem with all this censoring of FOX or anyone else is that it is just that.....censorship.",1270644899

The fact that drinking and losing sleep is physically unhealthy, along with the fact that there's widespread social pressure to partake, means that the question is worth exploring.  You don't have to agree with the answer, but your dismissive and defensive attitude is exactly why a study like this is worthwhile.<p>If you aren't someone who prefers not to drink, you probably don't really understand where the pressure comes from.<p>Every single time you go out with new people, people make comments on your lack of drinking.  Either the fact that you ordered a 7-up or that it's been 3 hours and you still haven't finished your first beer.  Plus the bar itself is designed to sell alcohol, so there's inherent pressure just by being there.<p>My primary career (IT) doesn't involve a lot of people going out drinking on a regular basis.  But I sing for fun, and in that field people are constantly out late, and yes there is pressure to drink.  EVERYONE who goes out drinks more than me, and even people I've known for a year or more still make comments.  And lately I've had to skip the drinking night because I have to be up at 6:30 AM the next morning for a meeting.  I feel much better physically and mentally but I'm socially out of touch.<p>Plus, there's the matter of being at the bar when your regular bedtime passes and your melatonin starts kicking in.  All the drinkers don't even notice and sit around yammering for another hour or four while you sit there yawning.",1270641852

- exercise (even just going for a walk round the local park while listening to some music)
- de-clutter (this is really, really beneficial - I've just moved house and the feeling of throwing out years of accumulated crap was fantastic) 
- socialise with some new people<p>Finally, be wary of books and seminars, etc - sometimes I find if someone is so completely off the scale in terms of achievement rather than motivating me it has the opposite effect. Don't be afraid to stop reading/leave an event if you find you're not getting energised by it.<p>A good book that's easy to read is The Magic Of Thinking Big. Nice, simple advice and a good pick-me-up. It's full of common sense and useful steps you can take to get re-energised.<p>Finally, I just want to echo what others have said: there's no rush; don't pressure yourself. There's a great quote on PG's website... ""Your twenties are always an apprenticeship, but you don’t always know what for.""<p>Good luck.",1270641711
1247012,comment,1246200,1246200,0,0,chriseidhof,,,"A book that really helped me is Flow by Csikszentmihalyi. You probably can recall a moment (for example, when programming) where you were in a state of flow, you were solving difficult problems (but not too difficult) and everything just went naturally.<p>His book is about this state, and about how to reach happiness in general. The key point is not only to depend on happiness as told by external people (e.g. parents, girlfriend, government, boss) but also create your own triggers. It might be making music, looking at a sunset, etc. In other words: be in control of your own happiness.<p>That being said, I think it's wise to see a professional. Ultimately, you'll have to do it by yourself, but they can help you get back on track and provide guidance and pointers. After all, it's their job.<p>Good luck!",1270641682
