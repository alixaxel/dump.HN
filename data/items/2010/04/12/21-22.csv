I will admit I was a SQL employee working on a component that was shipping in VS2010 (there's a handful of teams that did this, Entity Framework being one of them, although I wasn't actually on the EF team, they are a pretty visible example). My team really grew to dislike DevDiv and their practices quite a bit in a lot of regards (however, in other areas I enjoyed DevDiv a lot). To be totally blunt, SQL has their shit together a lot better than DevDiv does. And to be perfectly blunt again, it was the thought of doing this all over again for Dev11 that was a major motivator in me wanting to leave MS.<p>And is 2010 worth the upgrade for most people? Hard to say. There's nothing in it that is truly mind blowing or ""must have"", it just iterates and improves a ton of stuff.

Adobe's proprietary attempt at creating a cross-platform layer is thwarted. And Apple counts on having enough developers for new apps who already have a background in (or are willing to learn or relearn) Objective-C, C, C++ and JavaScript. It's simple and pragmatic.<p>That said, I'm a developer and I generally only use FOSS products for software. But I give Steve Jobs and his advisors more and more credit for business intelligence.<p>A lot of these comments are about Android. Could be that Apple learned from Sun's mistakes, whereas Google wasn't old enough to be around for the full cycle of that. I love Lua and Scheme. I wouldn't be surprised if senior engineers at Apple also love various different VMs, etc. And yet they would fully support this strategic move by Apple.<p>Why? Steve Jobs' genius has less to do with his douchey presentations and more to do with seeing the big picture dozens of business quarters before everyone else. When you've been seeing that far ahead for three decades, and have all the experience and confidence from succeeding with that like fourteen times, controversial decisions like with Section 3.3.1 aren't as difficult. They are one of 50 decisions that you've made 6 months ago with many different things in mind that won't be released to the public for quite some time -- many of them involving hardly black-and-white tradeoffs (see the Wikipedia entry for Jobs quoting Wayne Gretzky).<p>Apple has a model that works for them. And free software, free digital rights management, openness  -- if it gets in the way of their business strategy, by default they're going to plan around it.<p>If you really want Apple to change their policy, get the CEOs of businesses who develop apps to voice concern to Jobs. Show that Flash and Lua and Mono or whatever are mature enough technologies from a business standpoint. Make the argument that it's too much of a gamble for the iPhone/iPad 3GS to be without flash support with other tablets on the rise. (Apple is of course betting on HTML5 pretty heavily.)<p>I guess my point is that: 'Five rational arguments against Apple's 3.3.1 policy' is a good start. But those are mostly developer-based arguments. As a developer whose not in the embedded space, I have no idea what the business strategy arguments would be. But as a developer, I know when a client's use of a library's interface is slighty off. Or something like that. Maybe I don't even know that. Anyhoo.",1271106375

Apple has 180,000 apps in their App store, maybe a good time to remove incentives for a new influx of non-programmer-written apps straight from Flash? Oh, they're getting rid of other stuff that also encourages people to use other tools than their own? I think they can live with that.<p>#2: They're not. Tell me where and when Apple said: ""You will be able to develop for the iPhone using any and all tools of your choosing."" They didn't. They're simply clarifying what's been their position all along, that XCode/Cocoa is the environment in which you create iPhone apps. Sure, other stuff have been able to sneak in stuff, but hardly with an Apple seal of approval. If you're using one of those tools without a suspicion Apple might not like it even before this, I'd say you're a bit naive.<p>#3: Irrelevant. Apple has told developers which tools they can use from the get-go. I imagine the existing cross-platform products have been too small to have been a priority, but here comes Adobe with something that creates iPhone apps straight from the desk of a designer. Yes, did you see the CS5 presentation? ""Create iPhone apps without writing any code!"" Sounds like great apps to me.<p>#4: Of course it's unfair. But there isn't any better way to enforce their rules. Naturally there'll be apps that fall through the cracks. But a ""Aw, why can't I when that app could?"" whine sounds very 7-year-old to me. They're putting up rules, if you follow them you should be fine. If someone does something that might be within the rules, but they're not sure, they might get rejected. If someone else tries the same thing, they might get rejected, regardless of whether the first guy was caught or not.<p>#5: Not sure this ia a very good argument either. For me, I develop for Apple products because I love the platform, and I think there are quite a lot of other apps that have been hanging around with Apple because we feel that is the best platform in the world. Not perfect, but best. And I like it when Apple says that what we've learned during the years of sticking by the company because of that conviction, rather than some sense of duty, is going to pay off. Sure, Apple could release the platform to any and all languages out there, implement C#, Java and whatever else might be popular right now. But that would seem to me to cater to the populist crowd, rather than the faithful, so to speak. And those programmers are the same programmers that will move away from the platform when something else catches their fancy. I think Apple wants people like Omni Group rather than the ""Oh, lord, another device, another language, who cares? I guess I'll _have_ to learn it, then.""-crowd.",1271106340

Before facebook, quite a lot of social networking sites.<p>What happens is that someone does something that has already been tried in a somewhat different manner, and this particular combination hits on that particular thing that makes it grow rapidly, and with the rapid growth comes the disruption.<p>It's like ChatRoulette. You couldn't have done this successfully before now, cos flash just was not ready for this.<p>It's very difficult to sit down and plan disruption, because even things that are obvious now are not obvious at all before they exist.",1271106100
