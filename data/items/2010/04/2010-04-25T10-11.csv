I look at the issue with Mcaffee last week, and the Microsoft BSOD inducing update on infected machines earlier this year, as an untenable situation. Computers can't just stop working randomly or become exploited this easily. I would hope we could find a better solution but if open platforms continue to be plagued by these problems it's almost inevitable we'll see a shift towards locked down platforms in the future. We've already seen Microsoft move in this direction carefully with WHQL certified drivers. Who knows? In 5-10 years Linux might be the only open platform left. It's only going to take one major catastrophe to put the pressure on Microsoft, Apple, etc to lock down. Add in some government saber rattling and fear over ""cyber warfare"" and it's a done deal.",1272192115

Not to mention, in order to provide any amount of power you would need a massively heavy wire, likely heavier than the beanstalk itself. This is almost certainly true even for superconducting wire (due to the cooling requirements) but may even be true for hypothetical room-temperature superconducting wire.<p>Secondly, and more importantly, the electrodynamics of a 35,000 km conductor piercing through the Earth's magnetosphere are daunting to consider. Or consider the geodynamics of a lightning rod that spanned the ground through the stratosphere and beyond, it would constantly be discharging electric potential from the atmosphere. More than likely the result would include one or both of the beanstalk being dragged out of orbit or intense arcing along the beanstalk resulting in its destruction.",1272191499

So even the most technologically ignorant person can use them worry free and not end up with all the issues like they've had with Windows and even sometimes OSX machines.<p>OSX machines are REAL computers that let you do whatever you want. And OSX is mature, you won't be seeing many changes to it besides those that trickle up from kernel optimizations that occur on the iPhoneOS platform (Apple has moved many devs over from OSX to iPhoneOS).<p>An app store may be in the cards for OSX, but app lock out (locking out anything except app store apps) is not going to happen. If Apple did something like this, it would kill a large portion of their creative, scientific and development market. It will just be an easy application distribution system for those who want to a more convenient way to buy software (and for developers who are willing to give Apple a cut for this convenience).",1272191175

It significantly limits the targets, in space or on Earth, that weapons are capable of hitting.<p>As to whether ICBM arsenals are militarizing space, I think you would have a different opinion if we were to change contexts. Airplanes are air craft, boats are sea craft, and ICBMs are space craft. That all these vessels begin and end their travels on land, in port, or on the Earth doesn't change their fundamental natures. If the major powers of the world all had massive navies which they almost always kept in port except for occasional training missions we would not be pretending that the oceans were unmilitarized.",1272190749
