I think that until someone else would need to come along with something significantly better /and/ have significant advertising dollars to compete with ebay. (either that or ebay would need to screw up it's reputation system and badly.)  I don't think that facebook or any of the other social networks will compete in that arena... the social networks may help in advertising, e.g. driving people to a particular purchase, but I go to ebay to /find/ something, and I don't think facebook is a useful model for that sort of thing.<p>Sure, you can buy shit from your friends on facebook;  I do that without an online social network, through mailing lists and other informal networks.  But I don't think that really competes with ebay in any meaningful way.",1270954682

Clearly he wants to use a simple model for a visual representation and that is fine for the purpose. But the assumption of a fixed 4% increase in revenue is to simplistic for me. 
Either the product has some traction and success than the percentage numbers will be far higher, which totally changes the graphs dynamics or it does not generate sales.
