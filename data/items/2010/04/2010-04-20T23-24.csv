Often it was a model of ""OK, here is the labour price, here are the material prices, but what you're asking for is something we've never done before and it's impossible to estimate a fair price."" Surely my poor estimating skills were on display - but that's not what I was being paid for. Could we do it? Yes. Could we price it out to the penny? No. But we still got the job.<p>Once in a while it was simply, ""Yes, we can do that. No, I don't know how much it's worth. Let's do it and figure it out later."" And, with people who had confidence in my work, there was never a problem with this approach. I was often surprised at what people would pay. And as the article mentions, I would never use this approach with someone new or a large enterprise. But with familiars, this always worked out OK for me.<p>Fascinating to see this model applied to untried, almost purely intellectual work (code).<p>As with renovations, where you're often busting you're ass against someone with a pickup truck looking for beer money for the weekend. Working with code pits you against every chump with a computer. So how can you differentiate yourself?<p>Being able to say, ""Hey, no problem. I can do that, We'll square up on Monday."" is one way.

For instance, if a dev offers to do work for $100, but it is really worth $200 to the client, the client will accept the $100. The client may have offered $200, but now with the information that the dev will do it for $100, of course they will only offer $100.<p>tl;dr - The client must come up with a price first, and if they have a personal relationship with you and the value they gain is higher than your sunk costs, it will probably be higher than what you would have set.",1271805107

My apologies for being off-topic.]<p>I'm about to express an unpopular opinion, so I'm expecting lots of downvotes, but at least I believe that what I'm expressing is rational and from the heart.<p>Regarding this whole WikiLeaks incident, I felt bad for both the Iraqi casualties and the soldiers.  If the soldiers had full knowledge that they were firing on a family that was simply trying to help the wounded, you know that they wouldn't have fired.  They fired because they <i>assumed</i> there were insurgents in the van.  They made a mistake.<p>What really bothers me is that so many people get outraged over the soldiers' mistake, but so many people gladly eat factory-farmed meat.  Animals in factory farms are subject to a very painful existence before their lives are cut short.  Yet most people don't care.  It's hard for me to stomach the criticism that the soldiers get knowing that many of the people who criticize these soldiers will then go eat a burger, fully and willfully participating in a system that creates unnecessary suffering and carnage to innocent beings.<p>In other words, our priorities as a society are out of whack.  If we really cared about violence, there is something that <i>each</i> of us can do <i>right away</i>: go vegetarian.  It's easier to criticize the violence of soldiers than take action ourselves to live a less violent life.<p>Let the downvoting begin. :/",1271804525
