Also, can be made just about as healthy as you want, depending on what you put in.<p>For example, buy a chunk of deli meat, a block of cheese, some lettuce, some tomatoes, and various sauces (mustard, mayo), and you can slice them up and have a meal in about 5-10 minutes.

1238255,comment,1237939,1237939,0,0,awongh,,,"I think the ultimate time saver for cooking good tasting food with little effort is a crock pot. Anything that cooks food over low heat over a long period of time.<p>This method always seems to produce food that has that special ""something"" where all the ingredients meld into something magic. It's virtually impossible to mess up and it's good for getting rid of odd bits left in your fridge.<p>It can also be easily adopted to your nutritional requirements, and to any type of cuisine. Basically every single culture on earth has a version of stuff-thrown-in-pot-and-cooked-for-a-long-time.<p>The secret to success is to begin with similar ingredients. Usually onions and carrots and garlic- then celery for something european, bell pepper for something south american, maybe ginger for something asian.<p>Then you add some kind of cheap cut of meat, chicken, pork, beef, it doesn't matter, (sausage or ham, leftover meats- doesn't matter if they've been cooked already) then some other appropriate long cooking vegetable (potatoes, corn, anything that won't fall apart during cooking, an hour before eating, you can put in the more delicate vegetables). Then some water. Cover and leave it for like 4 or 5 hours and when you come back it'll be amazing. If it's appropriate, you can also add any kind of dried beans.<p>Prep is also easy, because you dont really have to worry about cutting the vegetables carefully. Just cut them any way you like and dump them in.<p>You can make rice or cous cous or quinoa (starch) to go along with it, or you can have it with bread or crackers.<p>Some specific examples: osso bucco, coq au vin (adding alcohol in really helps make it good) cassoulet, chili, goulash, tangine, gumbo, indian-style curries, etc., you can see how versatile this method is.....",1270273637

To have a bona fide intern, <i>all six</i> of the criteria need to be met.<p>State law may also impose additional requirements, as for example in California where the training must be part of an official educational curriculum at an accredited school - California imposes other restrictions as well.<p>All in all, the rules may be well-meaning but they effectively kill opportunities for students to get training in many situations where the employer would otherwise normally be glad to make the opportunities available. In practical terms, it means that an employer wanting to open opportunities to students needs to pay minimum wage at least. Of course, the idea of the regulations is to prevent employers from circumventing minimum wage rules by dressing up what is really a job as an ""internship"" and in this sense they serve a protective function.<p>Mark Cuban once did a piece entitled ""Want an Unpaid Internship So You Can Get Valuable Experience - Screw You"" (<a href=""http://blogmaverick.com/2009/09/05/want-an-unpaid-internship-so-you-can-get-valuable-experience-screw-you/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogmaverick.com/2009/09/05/want-an-unpaid-internship...</a>) in which he recounted his frustrations in dealing with the federal regulations, and this in turn elicited an interesting and lively thread here at HN (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=806563"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=806563</a>).",1270272486

(The low rest mass means that even tiny amounts of kinetic energy really get them zooming along.)  However in Ohmic conductors they frequently crash into scatterers, bouncing off at a random angle and imparting heat to the material.  In everyday materials like copper at room temperature, they spend so much time bouncing around that the <i>average</i> velocity of a conduction electron is low.<p>EDIT:  If you want to teach electricity, describe it as a fluid acted on by fast-moving pressure waves.  Resistance can be reasonably described by analogy to a viscous fluid flowing through a sponge.",1270271416
