Their core products are high quality in my view, but they just never wholeheartedly embraced the web. Neither technologically nor in terms of the business model. Fighting the web moved them from being seen as a freedom fighter against IBM to the position of a ceaselessly scheming oppressor that keeps inventing new ways of ruining the fun for the tinkerers.<p>They have alienated an entire generation of hackers and that's why in spite of all the money that can be made on their platform the interesting stuff happens elsewhere. Apple is on route to follow them, once the hype around their glitzy fashion items subsides.",1270879175
1254631,comment,1253490,1253490,0,0,mambodog,,,"Honestly, I still think people writing native code and using the native APIs for a platform like the iPhone is something worth enforcing. On the desktop multiplatform development toolkits consistently fail to deliver a user experience that is seamless and on par with apps built with the native APIs (especially on a platform with different interface conventions and guidelines, ie Mac OS) and for a platform such as the iPhone where resources are not infinite, and the interface is especially important, it just makes sense to enforce people doing things 'properly'. If that knocks out a few decent applications along with all the lazy, rubbish ports then I think that's acceptable. If they're really that amazing, then they probably justify being rewritten natively.<p>One place where I do have issue with this policy is in the case of game engines/middleware (ie. Unity). Due to the complexity and development requirements of game middleware I think an exception, or a more refined policy, is required to allow middleware to give the required 'leg-up' to game developers. Additionally, while Apple has provided an awful lot of what developers need to create great View-based applications for the iPhone with Cocoa Touch (within the constraints what third-party apps are allowed to do, at least), they haven't done so for games. This is understandable, again due to the aforementioned complexity of game engines, but it makes games a special case.",1270879136
