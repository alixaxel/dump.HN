The few renters who seem to do well financially would also do well financially as homeowners but for some reason have convinced themselves that the numbers work out better for renting. Maybe it does for those people, maybe it doesn't. I'll come back to that point in the next paragraph. In the meantime, however, the vast majority of renters one might speak to are just pissing away money, are no further in terms of savings than those with mortgages, and have none of the equity built up that those with mortgages have, even those who are pretty new to their mortgages.<p>Now, back to whether or not those ""smart"" renters are any better off. First off, I'll readily admit that my single data point is just that, but it bears consideration nonetheless. I bought property in 2005. In a neighbourhood with some growth potential, in an overall market with generally upward movement. Nothing bullish, just generally upward movement. In fact, that movement had been slowing a bit at that point, and continued to slow somewhat more afterwards. We all know what happened next. I sold early this year. I wonder how many smart renters could have done this _well_, even given the shitty few years I happened to own before selling: I paid $500 more per month than what I would have paid to rent the same space (in other words, put me up against a smart renter with $500 to invest each month), for a total of $30,000 ""invested"" progressively over those five years. I sold for a net profit of $125,000 after all fees, commissions, etc. In a hesitant market still recovering from the nasty troubles we all know too well.<p>Find me a renter with that kind of ROI on their investments over the last 5 years and I'll congratulate them over a nice lunch which I'll be happy to buy for them.<p><i>(crickets)</i><p>Yeah, I thought so.",1271567153
