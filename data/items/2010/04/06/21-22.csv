1245780,comment,1245346,1245346,0,0,byoung2,,,"""Clearly I’ve got a lot to learn about how Google Adwords works""<p>The secret to AdWords is the mysterious ""Quality Score"".  The higher the Quality Score, the lower the CPC.  The article didn't mention what the exact CPC was, but it did say that in total they got 82 clicks and they had £75 to spend.  That would be almost £1 per click!  That says to me that the Quality Score must be pretty low, likely 4/10 or lower.<p>When optimizing an AdWords campaign, pay attention to the keywords in the ad copy (title, body, and display URL), on the landing page (title, metas, body), and in the keyword lists themselves.  The same factors that affect SEO and PR can affect AdWords QS.  If he tried the experiment again and worked to get a QS of 7/10 or higher, the CPC would drop to a tenth of what it was before.  A QS of 10/10 in a niche market can see CPC even lower.",1270591181

Rolling the member volume back into the RAID1 set after the cloning operation can use the delta of the differences, rather than necessitating a whole-volume copy.  Replacing a disk necessitates a whole-disk copy.<p>If you're working with a fairly quiescent disk, then the difference between these two approaches probably isn't significant.

I worked for the company that provides the ""Get ___ Channel"" promotions for MSOs (Multiple System Operators, like Comcast, Charter, Time-Warner before being bought by Comcast, etc.), and the stranglehold they have on cable is staggering.<p>When cable first came out, it was seen as both a luxury and a way to bring high-quality programming to rural areas. Once MSOs began providing upstream data connections, they jumped through a lot of hoops to remain out of reach of telco regulation.<p>Considering Comcast is the largest cable system provider in the US, they'll either keep lobbying themselves into immunity, or someone in Congress will get a big hair up their ass that can't be removed by ""greasing the wheels,"" and it'll be a monopoly breakup on the scale of AT&T in 1984.<p>Personally, I wouldn't hold my breath. Lobby money is still pretty powerful.<p>Some good reading on the cable system history:\n<a href=""http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=unitedstatesc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=unitedstatesc</a><p>It was sickening when I first read the history of cable, but I have since come to realize that many industries operate the same way. Expecting companies to regulate their own industries is precisely how we arrived at the current situation. Anybody remember cable deregulation in 1996?

I certainly wouldn't want to have to bump my laptop against someone else's laptop (and sure, a tablet isn't a laptop, but the form factor is closer to a laptop than a phone). Once you get up to such a large device shouldn't the interaction be something more like flinging the contact info toward the device (like the scrabble tile interaction from iPhone to iPad)?",1270587797

Sitting in traffic in a car seems like a massive waste of my time (and my family's).  Of course, I am, perhaps, quite lucky--I can live near my job, in an affordable neighborhood (my mortgage is less than the rent many of my friends pay) that has actual stuff in it.  Yes, I sometimes drive the four miles to the store for food, but sometimes I ride my bike there, too.
