I'm not sure what the failure rate would have been if the Apollo program were allowed to continue with the same design (albeit better materials and engineering), but its probably incorrect to assume it would be the same for the two craft because they are fairly different designs and have different physics (i.e Shuttle rocking back and forth before launch is due to its ""piggybacking"").<p>However the two most significant design changes that would have reflected far different failure rates are: 1) Change in fuel type and 2) Presence of an abort sequence.<p>1) In the Apollo design, the rocket was liquid propelled, thus it could have been shut off (theoretically) at any point in the launch sequence.  The Space Shuttle by contrast has Solid Rocket Boosters, which once lit, do not turn off.<p>2) The Apollo rocket had an escape rocket mounted to the capsule that could have been fired and brought the crew to safety in the event that 1) did not occur.  The Space Shuttle by contrast cannot enter into an abort sequence until those SRB's are done firing.",1271383041

Trust is a verb, not a state of being.<p>Unless you are very unusual and are completely off the grid, you've probably solved the question of how you personally decide how to trust a wide variety of commercial agencies of highly varying degrees of regulation and highly varying degrees of life-threateningness. Possibly without realizing it. In theory it may be unsolvable, in practice it doesn't seem to be.<p>It should be pointed out that this isn't theoretical, either. People die because the FDA forces them to not take drugs, even when death is essentially assured in the short-term anyhow. It's a well-known problem. If the FDA was more advisory, I suspect it would be a net good. I really can't imagine people <i>en masse</i> running down to WalMart and buying  Dangerousol (now with twice the danger!) any more than they manage to now.

The main problem they wanted to solve was limiting the sphere of influence of skeleton vertices in the presence of concavities in the skeleton.

I'm not sure which method produces a better result (heat diffusion certainly is more computationally intensive), but heat diffusion seems like a very natural way to solve the problem.  Essentially, to determine a skeleton vertex's influence on a model vertex, you don't want the distance between the two ""as the crow flies,"" but rather the shortest path <i>within the skeleton</i> between the two points.  Perhaps a pathfinding algorithm could do the job more efficiently than heat diffusion?",1271381150

1269466,comment,1268382,1269094,0,0,endergen,,,"You are right, I hadn't thought of it all the way down. You could still have a code editor/navigator client that remotely accesses code, or locally stores it. But the code is run else where.<p>This would work fine for say editing a web app's code and then hitting refresh on each save. Until multi-tasking is released in iPhone OS 4.0 this will really require another device with a browser to view the updated code in a browser.<p>But again, this isn't what I'd call an IDE, it's more of a code editor. No debugging, profiling etc, unless you are connected to a runtime else where. But again this is far less desirable than being able to run/test code without a good networking connection or any connection at all.<p>Many other interactive environments other than squeak would be possible without these constraints, such as the Code Bubble IDE project:

The Apollo program had 11 launches and no loss of life... as long as you don't count the three astronauts who died on the ground in the Apollo 1 fire.<p>Assuming the same failure rate of 1.5%: (1 - 0.015)^11 = 0.84. That means that if the Apollo program was just as (un)safe as the Space Shuttle program, we would have an 83% chance of seeing no loss of life in the Apollo missions.<p>The Apollo program had the advantage of using big dumb boosters with no reusable parts, but the Space Shuttle program got to use newer materials and better engineering techniques. I'd estimate both were about equally unsafe. A 1% chance of death is way too high for any sort of civilian transportation. A simpler design (capsule + big dumb booster) with modern engineering and materials would be much safer than both.",1271380536
