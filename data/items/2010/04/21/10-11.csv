It boils down to being aware of the origins of the system you are using: how it came into existence, and why. The answer, of course lies in the mouth of the original author. In the case of GNU/Linux, the name of the system directly influences which guru we are going to listen to (Linus or Richard). This is very important, because the two men have very different political opinions.<p>Plus, as far as I know, GNU is bigger than Linux, in probably everything. Especially at the beginning of Linux.

They probably spent most of the first two years taking classes, though that varies too (I spread my classes over three years to have more time to start research earlier). I'm not even really sure how much time to allocate to my thesis, because there wasn't some official point at which I stopped doing classes and started doing thesis.<p>Edit: Actually, it just occurred to me you might be in Europe, where the norm <i>is</i> a three-year PhD thesis, in a pretty time-defined program.
