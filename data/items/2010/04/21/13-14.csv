1282172,comment,1281496,1281496,0,0,hga,,,"It occurs to me that if Google is smart they'll take a hands off approach with QPX.  It's a service ITA runs for its customers and it's got to have some pretty stiff service level guarantees.  For a bunch of their customers, if it's not up <i>their</i> customers can't book flights (well, they could <i>book</i> them, but they couldn't find out which flights to book).<p>Google's infrastructure is just not up to this level.  Customers with multi-year contracts like Alitalia will be none too pleased if QPX's infrastructure and code is mindlessly ""Googlized"" (well, Alitalia might be a bad example given Google's problems with Italy, maybe they'll say ""Nice airline you have here, it would be a shame if anything happened to it."" :-).<p>I can seem them doing the above, spinning off or ending QRES (a problem of bad timing as I've noted elsewhere), and then doing interesting things with various parts of QPX.  At the very least ITA has a whole bunch of interesting data feeds ... then again, I wonder what sort of contractual restrictions there might be on them.  Still, Google would be miles ahead by buying ITA and only requiring negotiations instead of starting from scratch, i.e. not even knowing what data feeds are out there until they hire domain experts.  And then there's capture and formatting and all that stuff, all already done in C++ by ITA.<p>They could be buying ITA for its domain expertise plus its pile of crackerjack programmers, the ones working on QRES wouldn't be pleased to be moved from Common Lisp but that could beat the alternatives.  Tough luck for the QRES Oracle RAC people at all levels, but perhaps there's a good market for their expertise (Microsoft sure had fun there when they screwed up with Danger/Sidekick).  And the QRES front end software is in Java (only the middleware is in Common Lisp).",1271858341

I would never have chosen to take a history class, and yet in that class I learned critical thinking skills in a way that I would have had no direct cause to do outside of that environment.  I gained a basic grounding in science.  I learned enough about a variety of different subjects that I was able to make an informed choice on a career path.<p>I certainly believe that the school system needs changing, particularly as self-learning becomes easier, and I agree that kids need more responsibility (I recall aching for it in my teenage years), but the number of comments here suggesting that school is of no use whatsoever surprises me.",1271858299

1282161,comment,1281883,1281883,0,0,ghotli,,,"This is one of the most frightening things I've seen on HN. A fleet of these killing machines would be so much more effective than ground troops at ""killing the enemy"". What bothers me is that if these are so much cheaper to make, and more accurate with less collateral damage then it makes our regime more effective at snuffing out foreigners that intelligence deems as dangerous for one reason or another.<p>It seems that this is one of those devices that you can not fight with, especially if they are deployed in great numbers. What do you do, stay inside if the U.S has deemed you a threat? Hack it to try to take control of it? That seems like a scarier proposition and one that is much more likely.<p>We're concerned that ""loose nukes"" will fall into the hands of ""the enemy"". An attack like that would cause great collateral damage. Eighty years from now, will we be worried about a competing economy that has the technical prowess to create such a killing machine as is linked in this article?

Merchant ships could provide some sort of landing pad and automatically detaching power umbilical.  Such drones could ""visit"" transiting merchant vessels and land there to loiter in good weather.  Once the merchant is out of danger, the drone could fly to its next assignment.<p>My original idea involved launchers in standard cargo containers, linking to a remote control facility on demand by satellite, but independent drones only requiring such landing pads would be even cheaper.",1271856093
