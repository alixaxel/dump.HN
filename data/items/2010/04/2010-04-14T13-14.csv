Ruby tried to correct Perl's mistakes, but also succumbed to the ""kitchen sink"" mentality.  Python tried to correct many earlier mistakes, but while it was more closely integrated with the underlying OS and still managed to be a relatively simple language, it got too tied up in the underlying OS.<p>Most of what he's talking about could be implemented with Lisp machine or a Smalltalk VM as OS Kernel.
