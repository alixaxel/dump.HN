And on the other side you'd have some non-programmers who are ""skeptical"" and coming up with all kinds of arguments why machine language is best. The skeptics would point out what they say are flaws in the reasoning, gaps in the data, etc.<p>This line of thought is not meant to argue that man-made global warming or catastrophic climate change are true and urgent, but rather to argue that perhaps that it doesn't make sense for non-scientists to take a stand on this issue -- especially taking a stand against the position of those who have vastly more knowledge and experience with the topic. Might they be wrong? Of course. But they are probably  way more likely to be right than the average bloke on the street.",1271919502

Who's the video game equivalent of Kubrick or Kurosawa or Bergman?<p>Penny Arcade's comment on this is wonderfully wrong: ""If a hundred artists create art for five years, how could the result not be art?""<p>Interestingly, that's exactly the sort of film that fails to be art. Great films are, without exception, products of a single driving vision, not designed by committee.<p>The only way to really claim that video games are art is to say, ""Here, this game <i>X</i> is the equivalent to <i>The Seven Samurai</i>."" Only that's not going to happen, because it doesn't exist. And because it doesn't exist, Ebert gets pummeled with long screeds of gamer angst rather than the only answer that would matter: ""Game <i>X</i> is art.""",1271919301

I also have this impression that Gruber takes anything negative towards Apple very personally, more than an average independent observer.<p>While others might find what gizmodo did distasteful, Gruber finds it offensive. When I think about the word ""offended"", I always think about it something personal that has been directed at you as opposed to your feelings towards something happened to someone you have never met in your life.

His actions had real consequences, and an apology (sincere as it may be) does not absolve him. Not in the least.<p>It's doubtful he's really changed, because he apparently needed advise from many people to figure out that his actions were far from honorable. For all we know he's simply in damage-control mode. Especially to sum it up as ""Made a mistake. Lesson learned."" (post title) strikes me as especially glib. An apology is now in his best interest, so of course he's going to apologize. It's not as if he has a choice.<p>That said, I do believe he feels bad about the situation, and I think the apology is sincere. But I also think that his original actions were scummy, and that his instinctive reaction (cover up / hope it blows over / attacking victim on internet) shows his character.

Second, I didn't mean to be negative or snarky (I can be abrasive sometimes, so sorry about that). It's just that no one experiences detection rates that high in the real world.  If AV actually worked that well, it would be incredible. I'd be the first person to publicize it.<p>In regards to AV Comparatives, I responded to why their tests aren't relevant in in the real world here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1284321"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1284321</a>. The bottom line is that detection rates as high as 97% are generally regarded by industry experts as inflated (John Viega says in one of his books that some people estimate actual detection rates to be around 30%).  AV companies themselves would never use that number as a part of their marketing campaigns. You'll note that on the product pages of the AV products tested, the numbers aren't listed.  If a 99.6% detection rate was actually. valid, don't you think it would be displayed in large and bold letters on the product page?<p>I'm not saying people shouldn't run AV, but we need to be honest about the actual capabilities of these products.

What actually matters is the vulnerability window.  This window is generally a week or two and occurs after a piece of malware is released into the wild.  It is the amount of time it takes AV vendors to get a signature distributed. Most damage is done during the vulnerability window, during which infected machines will have their AV disabled by the virus. The fact that your AV can detect viruses released years ago actually doesn't have any bearing on your security; it's a meaningless evaluation of the product.<p>You have to ask yourself, why don't AV vendors report numbers like the percentages found in AV Comparatives? They don't because they know it's bogus. Sure, most AV vendors will list AV Comparatives and others as an ""award"" or a ""certification"", but they'll never list the actual number.
