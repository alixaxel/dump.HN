Windows world went too far with any program and their dog putting an updater, or status icon in the systray - but in Ubuntu you have the choice of not putting new stuff there. For example, I've got an update notifier, power, network, dropbox and volume in the notification area now. How is this abuse? Why should I resign from having those icons there?<p>They've already done the experiment with removing update notifications from the notification area (names point at the irony here).
