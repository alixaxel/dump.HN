1255977,comment,1255858,1255888,0,0,fab13n,,,"> I think Apple feared that more third-party toolkits are on the way, and that they'll become more popular.<p>I guess Apple has been surprised by apps popularity. Their original policy was that 3rd party applications ought to be web apps (initially, it was the only way to go).<p>Embedded applications make sense:<p>* for super-tightly integrated user experience: but then, you don't want any lowest common denominator middleware on the way, as they guarantee a crappy experience (typically way worse than a decent and portable web app, see below).<p>* for driver-like stuff that do magic (but Apple always hated the idea of 3rd parties writing such sensitive code, which is one of the reasons why OSX is way more stable than Windows)<p>* because in some countries, users are stuck with a not-so-reliable 3G carrier, so being able to run offline is valuable. Hopefully that's a temporary situation, and I understand that HTML5 allows to write offline-compatible web apps anyway.<p>* because it's culturally accepted to pay a couple of dollars for a fart simulator app, but most people won't pay a dime to access the New York Times content in a web site. That's the reason why most apps are apps rather than web sites, but that's a problem with the web, not Apple's business.<p>This last point is at the core of most issues with Apple's tight control on iPhone apps: most of them should have been web app. They've been written as apps <i>not</i> to benefit from the iPhoneOS platform, but to benefit from the AppStore's easy monetization and publicity. It's about the AppStore, <i>not</i> about the iPhone!",1270943630

Adobe claims to have a project to port Flex to iPhone, and I can't assume that it will use native UI controls. Since the iPhone is all about the rich user experience, perhaps by limiting access to the AppStore for prior-life Flash 2D games, Apple is protecting the dilution of the quality of the games.<p>As for the other build an iPhone app application frameworks, the quality of the finished product varies from lackluster to average. At the worst, the finished app looks like one of the RSS reader apps that Apple is now trying to filter out of its AppStore. At the best, it's something like Location Scout. I believe by limiting access to third-party application builders, Apple is going to continue to increase the quality of iPhone apps. Titanium, Adobe et al will never generate anything like Tweetie 2. And, I believe Apple wants more Tweetie 2-caliber applications. To increase the S/N ratio. I believe Apple wants less crap and cookie cutter applications, even though some of the top 25 Free and Paid lists may from time to time have those types of 'Fart' type apps.<p>Apple is a premium brand. Even for developers. There are barriers to developer entry. It is kind of a privilege to write iPhone apps as you need $99/yr and an Intel Mac. The Cocoa/UIKit framework and CoreData persistence are tools that Apple engineers have invested centuries of programmer years in developing. There aren't many private APIs in Apple land; almost all of the standard iPhone apps could be recreated by third-party developers. And now with OS 4.0, I believe only a small fraction could not be recreated. As another example, Titanium et al. are not using CoreData - CoreData is designed to make managing and persisting an object graph easier.  Which is what you need for non-cookie cutter applications. I have yet to find one application built on RhoMobile, Titanium, Ascena etc that leverages CoreData.<p>And, I wouldn't be surprised if they start rejecting apps for quality (as in what does this app provide that is of value).<p>""He downloaded Titanium on a Saturday morning, and by Sunday night he had a functional prototype of his Location Scout app...""<p><a href=""http://www.appcelerator.com/partners/case-studies/locationscout/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.appcelerator.com/partners/case-studies/locationsc...</a><p><a href=""http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Applications_for_iPhone:Developer_FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Applications_for_iPhone...</a>",1270941684

It was called SOS Interface, marketed also as Action! by the company Expertelligence.<p>Steve Jobs hired him and Jean-Marie created the Interface Builder - which became one of the most important tool on NeXT OS. Then for Mac OS X and now for iPhone OS.<p>This innovation is now hindered by Apple.

The goal is no longer to be a maker, a creator, a programmer. You can't even use a shell to connect to your own iPad.<p>There is huge domain of visual programming and end user programming to be explored on touch screen devices.

One is that, with an intermediary layer, new features added by Apple cannot be used by anyone relying on an intermediary layer to build iPhone apps until the maintainers of the intermediary layer add support for it. From what few comments we've gotten out of Apple, it seems they are trying to avoid a situation in which there is a large ecosystem of developers who are unable to directly exploit Apple's newest innovations on the platform, and instead work with least-common-denominator that their layer provides.<p>I think this is a totally reasonable thing to want.<p>The other side to this is that there is probably not a good technical way to make people obey. Innovation directly on top of a platform can involve abstraction into layers. For example, most of the best games all involve multiple layers of abstraction, in the form of a managed runtime for the game, some sort of scripting engine (or template/meta-language for specifying behavior), dynamic compiler (for shaders, AI and other tasks), etc.<p>The first thing a good programmer does when faced with a complex and uncertain problem is to build a grammar to express their ideas in on top of the foundation you're given. In C, this usually involves writing sets of routines that form a second (usually ad-hoc) 'language' that can be composed together to form complex ideas without having to hand-code everything over and over.<p>I see tons of bad and dumb Objective-C iPhone, iPad and Mac apps. It's completely possible to write first-class stuff in something other than Objective-C or C. ML variants, such as OCaml, SML and now even Haskell are speed demons in comparison to Objective-C. (The thing that makes Objective-C 'fast' is that when you need it to be fast, you just write the routines only in C, without message dispatching. Want to know how much fun it is to write GUI glue in C? Not very.)<p>I hope this means Apple is not going to start rejecting apps that are polished, fast, and innovative simply because they are built or expressed with tools other than C. I realize a lot of Flash->Objective-C compiled stuff would be crap. A lot of Objective-C stuff is crap, too. But some guy with his own hand-rolled Scheme runtime with message passing mapped onto the UIKit classes implemented with closures? If you reject that, you're going to piss off the very best developers, and dig yourself into the kind of hole that no technology company in history has been able to maintain mindshare once inside.<p>Addendum: if it's true that Apple's primary intention of removing layers is to keep their APIs and ecosystem nimble, then I would expect them to <i>not</i> reject games made with intermediary software, such as Unity3D. Games usually play outside of the main OS framework kits and are not as beholden to new UI features as normal application kit programs.",1270941409
