For example, ever hear the quote from Gandhi along the lines of ""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.""? Cool line, which has made it onto T-shirts with Gandhi's photo, but Gandhi never said it. It's been traced back to a speech by a garment workers' union official in the early 20th century. Anyway, there are zillions of examples, many being propagated by spam websites supposedly specializing in quotes. Because of this, online references that say ""<i>attributed</i> to Bonaparte"" (or whomever) are worth nothing. In fact, they're evidence to the contrary, because if Bonaparte really said it, it wouldn't be ""attributed"", it would be sourced.<p>The rule of thumb is: if a famous person said it, it will be easy to find a precise textual citation on Google. So if you can't find the precise text, it's likely inauthentic.<p>Wikiquote is pretty good at distinguishing between sourced and unsourced quotes and providing precise references for the former. Take a look at their page on Napoleon (<a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Napoleon_I_of_France</a>) and see how many of them are traced to his letters.
