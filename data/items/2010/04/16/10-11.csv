1270235,story,,,3,11,alexwyser,"Ask HN: How about a Co-founders Search Site?",,"Recently, someone on HN started a HN Contractors spreadsheet so that it becomes easy to find contractors who are here at HN.<p>I was wondering if anyone would be interested in developing a website around that idea. Only instead of contractors, it would be for findingco-founders.<p>I was thinking that the site would have two sections.<p>In one, it would allow people wiling to work for equity to post their skills/resumes.<p>In the other, it would allow people to post their ideas (say a web app they want to build), and put up requests for developers, designers, etc, who have the necessary skills. And also indicate how much equity s/he would be willing to share with each.<p>The reason I think this will be good idea is because I am a designer and a very good one at that (my portfolio is at www.alexwyser.com), but I dont have any coding skills. My head is full of all kinds of interesting ideas, but I cannot execute them. If a talented developer(s) would be willing to work with me on my ideas, I would gladly give him/her 80% or more of the equity.<p>I understand that it is best to find co-founders from among you real-life friends/acquaintances, but some people simply don't know anyone with the right skills.<p>I am sure that a lot of people here have ideas they can't execute because they lack the skill and don't know anyone with those skills, and would find this site very helpful.<p>So what do you guys think? Would it work? Is it worth trying out? Would anyone like to work with me to build this website?",1271415301

1270215,comment,1269951,1269951,0,0,stretchwithme,,,"massage usually only provides a temporary benefit because it releases the tension in the muscles, but does nothing to keep it from returning.<p>The stiffness in muscles is ultimately caused by poor circulation through the muscle.  The sarcomeres pump their own blood supply and if the demand is greater than the supply, the sarcomere can run out of energy in its contracted position.<p>This contraction shortens the entire muscles when many sarcomeres are affected.  New blood cannot enter the sarcomeres until something pushes out the depleted blood.<p>Massage can do this, but massage will not correct the poor circulation that caused the stiffness to begin with.<p>And that circulation problem is usually caused muscle sheaths that have not been stretched frequently enough.  The body's natural collagen deposition essentially gluing it to itself so that it cannot expand or stretch normally.<p>This creates a tight situation when you use the muscle inside of this sheath.  The muscle is thicker when contracted and pushes out against this sheath.  That creates pressure and blood takes the path of least resistance away from your tight muscle.<p>The tightness inside the muscle must be massaged and then the sheath must be manipulated and stretched.  Otherwise, the sheath is too stiff due to the stiff, thick muscle inside it.<p>Further compounding the situation is the way tense muscles effect other muscles and spread the problem.  Muscles work together and communicate that a load needs to be moved.  A great system when things are healthy, but a permanent source of stress that will thwart efforts just limited to a muscle and its sheath.",1271414093
