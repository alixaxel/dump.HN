1269362,comment,1269032,1269275,0,0,_delirium,,,"I can see some of both sides. From the kernel developers' perspective, wakelocks solve a special-case problem: they only work on systems where frequent suspend/resume is possible (e.g. ARM/SoC style devices), have tight kernel/app integration, and accepting them means basically forking the power-management support within the kernel, with one system for Android-style devices, and another system for everyone else. They'd prefer a more unified power-management API, but solving that problem in a way that works for everyone is a lot harder. AFAICT, nobody on either side has put much effort into solving that general API problem. Not sure who to blame for that, but in theory, the maintainers of the current power-management API could've put forth a counter-proposal for how to accommodate Android's concerns in their framework; or Google could've put forth a revised proposal for how to merge wakelocks-like functionality with the existing power-management API.<p>Some of it might just be a mismatch between how the kernel process works and how Google usually does things. The convention is that when you submit an API-changing patch upstream, you're proposing: I think <i>all users of Linux</i> should have this new API, and you have to be prepared to defend the API design, modify it in response to criticism or concerns, etc. Ideally, you're supposed to get feedback from other potential users before you actually write the code, as opposed to designing everything unilaterally and presenting it as a done deal. From what I can tell, Google's approach was just a one-off: here's what we propose, and btw we already shipped it. Basically, skipped the step where they were supposed to first propose it and ask for feedback.<p>An approach that might've gotten more positive results would be, before sending off the patch, send a short design proposal with something like: ""Hey, for our needs we're thinking of the following API, because [explain why existing APIs are insufficient], and [explain rationale and use cases for this one].

Profitable, comfortable, but no prospects of explosive growth.<p>To quote from the link above:<p><i>What is start-up purgatory, you ask? Start-up purgatory occurs when you don’t go bankrupt, but you fail to build the No. 1 product in the space. You have enough money with your conservative burn rate to last for many years. You may even be cash-flow positive. However, you have zero chance of becoming a high-growth company. You have zero chance of being anything but a very small technology business (see Navisite). From the entrepreneur’s point of view, this can be worse than start-up hell since you are stuck with the small company.</i><p>37Signals seem to be quite fine with their business. However, they appear not to understand that many others are quite deliberate in choosing riskier strategies because the rewards can be higher.",1271377238

If you have 1mil invested, and you are making 1 mil a year, that's pretty goddamn impressive.  If you have 750 million invested, and you are making 1 million a year profit, well, gee,   I could do better than that buying bonds.<p>Now, Both AAPL and facebook have the P/E ratios they have because people expect them to make more money in the future than they are making now.  For instance, if I was to sell my company (and I've had a few offers)  it looks like I'd get about a year worth of revenue.  This is pretty typical when buying ISPs, because nobody expects exponential growth to go on for any period of time.<p>Just sayin;  It is a reasonable and well-established idea to look at how much equity is invested when looking at a company's profit margins.    It's also reasonable and well-established to look forward at how much profit the company is expected to make in the future, too, which is why facebook is valued as it is by some people.<p>(there is, however, a great degree of uncertainty in projecting what profits a company may make in the future, which is why there is a great deal more controversy over the value of twitter than over the value of AAPL.   Personally, if there was a convenient way to buy a long-term 'put' on twitter, I'd do it.  Just my opinion,)",1271377159

Basically, the presenters are covering the cost of the venue, A/V, coffee, etc.<p>If you're a group who's goal is really to foster innovation, and get access to great investment opportunities, I prefer the VanTech Angels methods vs SVASE.<p>But like I said, there is room for all sorts of these things.",1271377108

These rockets are expensive (an order of magnitude more than SpaceX), but they can do one thing that SpaceX can't: guarantee success.  If you had to put up sensitive cargo (commercial or military) that costs on the order of $100 million (and sometimes much much more), would you entrust a fledgling company with its sparse mission success record or the more established company with proven success?  And if you were to hop on a rocket, would you pick the one that had a severe failure within the past few years, or one that has been operating as engineered for the past 20-30 years?<p>Rocket launching doesn't go by the typical startup mantra.  Mistakes are very real, very expensive, and have much more human impact.<p>SpaceX seems more to me like fast food: their efficiency is awe-inspiring, but I worry at what significant cost?",1271376500
