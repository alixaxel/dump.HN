Spielberg gave the idea to Lucasarts because he knew it would take decades before the technology would be available to do the story justice. Written by Spielberg and Orson Scott Card.<p>I'm sorry, but Ebert has no fucking clue. There was a game out in 1995 written by <i>the</i> Steven Spielberg and <i>the</i> Orson Scott Card, that game alone quantified the video game medium as having great potential for artistic works.<p>There's a whole whack of games from the SCUMM era that have so much story it's still unbelievable by today's standards, even with BioWare.<p>Sorry Mr. Ebert you're now entering your second decade of being out of touch with the world, obviously we left you behind in 1995 when Spielberg, one of the greatest film directors alive, saw greater potential in video games than in film. If you were aware of this fact, I wouldn't doubt you would still hold a grudge against video games like newspapers hold a grudge against the internet and blogs. I know it must hurt that video games are know a bigger global entertainment resource than film, but that is a fact you will just have to live with. Don't worry, just like the inevitable death of newspapers, you'll probably still be so outdated that you won't notice the death of film before the world has forgotten your once relevance.",1271530060

1273486,comment,1273397,1273397,0,0,secretasiandan,,,"I would stress that with Excel, changing the underlying data set, especially dimensions of your data is annoying and not very automate-able.  This is the case even when the analysis is the exact same or very similar as the original.  You either need to copy formulas over for every data set/sheet or write VBA code to automate this, which still isn't as flexible as in R.<p>Excel is better if you want to pore over the data: study a piece, scroll down, study some more.  R is better if you can easily pinpoint the areas you think are interesting and index directly into the array.  Excel has indexing capabilities (F5 which goes to an address), but not by row/column names.<p>Additionally, you can't do multi-step analysis that involves segmentation/sub-setting of the data very easily with Excel.  This is related to the first point about changing an underlying data set or its dimensions.  There are ways around this, but they are VERY annoying.<p>I use R for the majority of my analysis.  I used to be a Matlab user but needed to find a cheaper tool when I left my job.  I still use excel for simple data inspection and when I need to send my analysis to other people to peruse.",1271529966

No one can be credibly offered the other motivators when there's a chance of complete ownership change in the near future. (""The new owner might promote you; they might fire you. We can't guarantee either outcome because what we're selling is the option value."")<p>None of the studies of motivation I've seen have specifically addressed such a situation. They concern motivating <i>good</i> work, not <i>sticking around through a foreseen ownership discontinuity</i>.<p>A stay package may not make people happy and productive, but it does <i>contractually</i> keep them around, giving the new owners a reasonable chance of receiving the knowhow and functioning business, before eventually making their own personnel/motivation decisions.<p>(That's why even though Fred Wilson is right about the stay packages' propriety and value, I don't think there's anything wrong with calling them 'bribes'.
