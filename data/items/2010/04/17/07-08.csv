1272790,comment,1271888,1272273,0,0,_delirium,,,"That's true, and I think it is an improvement when it comes to the ability to do local forks. But most of the big fights I've seen in CVS/SVN-based projects ultimately come down to who controls mainline, and a DVCS doesn't solve that problem at all. If anything, it makes it easier to put even <i>more</i> politics on top of it, where instead of having a fight over getting into the single repository, you now have to navigate whole cascading set of repositories (e.g. Linus doesn't generally pull directly from you, so you have to deal with sub-gatekeepers before you get to the main gatekeeper).<p>I suspect Linus likes the approach not because it has no politics, but because it encourages the politics that match the way he'd like to manage the Linux kernel development, with this style of hierarchical, cascading commit approval, which is pretty hard to set up in CVS (though Mozilla's sort of grafted it on via their Bugzilla, which keeps track of cascading approvals of patches based on who owns which areas and sub-areas). Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, it's just different (and for a project as large as Linux, probably necessary).",1271491154

1272788,comment,1270775,1271310,0,0,dsplittgerber,,,"GS needed a bail-out. Pleae read Too Big To Fail by Andrew Ross Sorkin, or any other detailed book about the financial crisis, and you will learn that GS had massive trust issues in the market. The 'bail-out' for GS got done primarily for the supposed trust in the stability and balance sheets of financial institutions it signaled - it was mostly for bridge financing (disregarding banks who actually were in deep shit all along, which GS was not one of). Yes, the exact details of the bail-out were shoved down their throat. Question being if GS would have made it at all if Treasury had waited any longer.",1271491078
1272787,comment,1271888,1272735,0,0,Deestan,,,"> Undoing a commit/push means rebasing or resetting, and that's where git drives me insane.<p>To look on the bright side first, Git is the only(+) DVCS in which you <i>can</i> clean up these kinds of mistakes without cluttering the revision history with ""revert"" and ""oops sorry"" changesets. :)<p>> I have used subversion, CVS, and even Visual SourceSafe, but only in git have I lost previous commits. Again with the misleading terminology. Why call them commits if you can destroy them with a single command?<p>The changesets are not really destroyed; you have just redeclared the official revision history not to include them, so they aren't visible.  The changesets are still alive within the database until the garbage collector picks them up at a later date (then they <i>will</i> be destroyed), and you can access them via looking up the revision ID in the revision log (or sometimes just by scrolling up the terminal window).  Once you have the revision ID, you can tag it (or declare it a new branch) so you don't lose it until you're done with the cleanup.  Then you can cherry-pick, rebase, merge or do whatever you want to fix the erroneous commit.<p>This bit of Git causes a lot of headache among new Git users for the first few weeks (me included), since you need to understand the underlying database and really toy around with it a lot to understand how to do stuff like this properly.  Though once I finally <i>got</i> it, Git replaced HG as my favourite VCS.<p>(+) That <i>I</i> know of at least. :) HG supports a ""rollback"" command, but that only covers one changeset, and you can't really use it if you have pushed your changeset or if it has been pulled by somebody else.",1271490995

I also 'intuitively' expected it to have something like git's index, and ended up just working around that by just laboriously creating my own set of patches to feed it in another checkout.

1272766,comment,1270579,1272362,0,0,Niten,,,"False.  (Or at least willfully misleading.)<p>It is true that Hussein did use chemical weapons, with a wink and a nod from the Reagan administration, against Kurdish civilians in the Iran-Iraq war.  However, in this context, the question of whether Hussein ""had weapons of mass destruction"" is clearly a question of whether he had them leading up to the 2003 US-led invasion, which, to the best of anybody's knowledge, he did not.  After the invasion the Iraq Survey Group concluded that Iraq had destroyed all major stockpiles of WMDs and had completely ceased production in 1991.<p>An increasing number of revisionist apologists are intentionally conflating whether Hussein ever had chemical weapons, and whether he had them in 2003, which was the (ostensible) justification for the war.

It's kind of a standard joke in AI circles that if you have a demo coming up, one way to make your dumb system seem smarter is to make sure it takes a bunch of time and displays diagnostic messages while doing so. Ideal is to slap a fancy sci-fi-movie front end on it that displays both nice graphics (for flashiness) and a console window spewing a bunch of technical garbage (for scientificness).<p>Of course, there are some legitimate reasons people might come away with the impression that a system like that is smarter, mainly that they have more idea what it's actually doing, because it was slowed down and visualized in a way that let them see it operate (instead of just spitting out the solution).<p>The somewhat less legitimate reason is that there are a certain group of people really enamored with high-end computing, and so if your thing runs in 2 seconds on a desktop, they assume it must suck, because why weren't you doing something fancier that needed 30 minutes on a huge cluster?",1271489720
