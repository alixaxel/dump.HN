They went from nothing to 1/3 of the way there in 1 quarter, pretty much.<p>Depends on how quickly Apple can make it to other carriers.  If I were the carriers, I'd have a few backroom meetings to NOT offer the iPhone (lest they become dumb pipes!).<p>If I were Android, I'd drop the rev-share for apps to 15% from 30% so developers make more money with less sales.
