1298219,comment,1297009,1297009,0,0,pge,,,"As a VC, I am frustrated that Powerpoint has become the standard format for presenting a business plan.  If there is ever a time not to be ""hypnotizing chickens,"" it's when you're presenting your company for funding.  Here's an anecdote to illustrate how ingrained it as become.  The other day, a CEO came in to meet with me.  He dutifully plugged his laptop into the projector and opened up Powerpoint to page 1 with the company name and date. Then we started talking.  Half an hour later, the presentation was still open to the title page. I asked him if he was going to go through the slides. He answered, ""Only if you want to, I hate powerpoint.""  With that, we turned off the projector and had a lively conversation.  I mention that story, because it was enlightening (and disappointing) to me that someone who was a great presenter without powerpoint felt compelled to bring a PPT presentation and put it on the projector.\nPPT is doubly insidious because it makes for poor presentations first, and then second, the content-poor PPT becomes a leave-behind document that tries to stand on its own without the accompanying narration.  It's bad enough when it is being spoken to, it's much much worse as a format for a standalone document to be read in isolation.\nLet me make this suggestion to startups looking for funding and meeting with VCs.  The best deliverable is a 4-5 page PDF text document (with accompanying or embedded charts or diagrams where they are critical to illustrating a point).  Text forces you to complete your thoughts in way that powerpoint does not. And a text document stands alone much better than a powerpoint and conveys a lot more content in the same volume of print. When you do present, use charts or diagrams to illustrate key points, not as the substance of the presentation. \nI don't mean to say never use PPT, that's as absurd as saying always use PPT.  I recognize that for some people, powerpoint serves as an important guide as they present (a publicly visible form of notes). If you present better with PPT, by all means use it, but don't feel compelled to if you don't want to. And for those that like PPT, I would encourage you to go through the exercise of thinking through how you would present _without_ powerpoint.  I think you will find that your presentation improves. You start thinking in whole concepts instead of trying to convey your ideas in bullet points.",1272376608

I also found out from previous postings where you're from.<p>I was intrigued by the legal issues and after doing some research I am not so convinced any more as I was in my previous answer. You didn't provide the full text of your non-compete clause but most 'standard' ones are quite elaborate and do include broad exclusions on what is considered being in competition. Considering that your company can afford professional council I would expect your employment contract to be quite elaborate and tight. The case law also points to a fairly broad interpretation of non-compete clauses - i.e. the competition can be only slightly overlapping and that would still be covered by many non-compete clauses.<p>On top of that, now that I know who your employer is, I would argue that you are (with at least one of your products) in direct competition with them and/or several of their strategic partners. It still sucks for you that they promised you could continue work on it and now they won't let you but that does not have any legal standing any more.<p>Anyway good luck.

1298203,comment,1296602,1296602,0,0,TrevorBurnham,,,"Title is a bit misleading since the ""how"" doesn't come until the middle of Steve's letter. Here it is:<p><quote><p>First, the bill would redefine who would be qualified to be an angel investor.  Currently individuals with either $1 million in investable assets or $250,000 in income qualify as accredited investors.  The new bill would change this to individuals with $2.3 million in assets or $450,000 in income.  According to the Kauffman Foundation, this would eliminate 77% of accredited investors.  This single handedly would reduce the amount of capital available to early stage businesses and stunt our much needed job creation.<p>In addition, the new bill would require any company attempting to raise angel investment to seek SEC approval, which would take up to 4 months.  As an active angel investor myself, I can say with certain that companies in this stage can rarely wait four months for funding. They will simply be forced to close up shop.<p></quote>",1272376223

It's a completely differen't protocol then ftp (not to be confused with ftps which is ssl'd ftp). It's basically a tunneled connection via ssh and does everything you'd expect ftp to do including, file listing, resume support and extended attributes. It's got some advantages over ftp such as multiple streams in one connection, and ssh level security (sftp itself provides no security it's all over ssh).<p>According to wikipedia, the overhead of scp is the same due to both using ssh, but scp can transfer a little faster by not waiting for packet conformations before sending data. This means unfortunately that transfers cant be stopped and resumed because packets aren't guaranteed to arrive in order.",1272374910
