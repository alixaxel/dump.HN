1298800,comment,1298355,1298559,0,0,affiliator,,,"There are two parts to this issue, the most minor of which being that depictions of mohammed are forbidden. Indeed depictions of any prophet are frowned apon by the majority of muslims. Disney's 'The Prince of Egypt' was banned in many predominantly muslim countries for example. The reasoning behind this is that the worshiping of stone idols was the religion of the day in Mecca before Mohammed started evangelizing. It was the desire for Islam to be far removed from these practices. Yet for any rules that are in place for muslims, non-muslims are not required to adhere to them, hence no-one at Disney was threatened or murdered.<p>There is some cross-over of course, where a non-muslim cannot for example walk around half-dressed in a muslim country but making depictions of mohammed in a Western publication is certainly not one of them. I cringe when I hear people say something like 'Mohammed's image might be sacred to muslims, but not us'. Muslims are, you could argue, some what responsible though as mohammed has been elevated to something far above a human being in some of their minds, ironic when his one message was that God alone is worthy of worship.<p>The real issue and what is being continuously glossed over when this brouhaha boils over is that some muslims take deadly issue with mohammed or Islam being mocked. There are a few accounts of poets in mohammed's lifetime who slandered either him or Islam and were subsequently murdered. Most muslims doubt these accounts are factual, believing perhaps they were made up to suit someone's agenda after mohammed died. after all Mohammed was constantly berated by a multitude of detractors while he was alive and he didn't call for their deaths, but rather peace treaties.<p>Some muslims though - the dangerous ones - see them as valid and regard them as instructions as to how to conduct themselves when a similar situation arises. If you managed to watch the video clip revolutionmuslim created, you will hear that the audio which plays over the montage is of an imam discussing some of these stories. So this is why the Danish cartoonists are being threatened, not because they made an image of mohammed but because they slandered him. This is why Theo Van Gogh was murdered and this is why the South Park creators are being threatened. Behind the mask of these veiled threats of course lies a sub-section of muslims who wish to rouse their brethren to engage in a full-on assault of the west. The vast majority of muslims will ignore them but those already holding a vendetta might give them ear.",1272386974

I've been lucky enough to get to test-drive the HTC Incredible and it's most certainly on par with anything the iPhone currently offers. Google is pushing Android in the right direction at a really fast clip.<p>I absolutely think Android will dominate in terms of market-share in the next two years (unless Apple starts loosening control over the iPhone). I think that issues like how applications are distributed and those particulars over multi-tasking (Android still has an entire class of Apps that won't run on iPhone OS 4.0) are going to continue to play a big role in the competitive environment for years to come. I just don't see Apple coming off of it's hard line position on these things.<p>In the end I think Android wins because it simply opens the door for more innovation from a much larger group of smart people. It enables broader categories of application development. At the same time the shotgun strategy phone development is a proven one.

Part of what I like about OSX is just the general logic by which everything hangs together-- but I wouldn't try to convince somebody who likes the way Windows is set up that they're ""wrong.""<p>That said, here are a number of specific things I like about OSX.<p>As a developer, I really like the integration between the command line and the GUI.  Examples: (1) Command ""open <thing>"" equivalent to double-clicking <thing>. (2) Commands pbcopy and pbpaste move information to and from system-wide pasteboard. (3) Drag-and-drop an icon onto the Terminal window fills in its path. (4) Standard copy and paste keyboard commands work in Terminal.<p>As a person who just has to use a lot of software, I like a number of other things.  The wide standardization of key bindings across apps means very short learning curve to get competent, and no mental remapping when jumping between apps.<p>Furthermore, I'm required to run MS Office for work, and I like the fact that it's no more painful than on a PC.<p>I guess overall, I would say that OSX gives me the feeling of control that Linux promises, without the feeling of needing to become an expert in everything that Linux often imposed on me.",1272386403

Although I'm glad that we have strong free-speech rights in this country that guarantee even their right to assemble, there's a world of difference between a KKK rally and some cartoons, even racist ones.<p>2. I'm not so sure that ""everyone dress up as a Klan member day"" would be so unreasonable, if some other group of crazies showed up and started killing people, crazies <i>so crazy</i> that they made the Klan seem sympathetic by comparison.

1298743,comment,1297890,1297890,0,0,dasht,,,"Perhaps they have buyer's remorse and are trying to pressure you to quit?  or are setting up a ""for cause"" firing?   Here is a similar-sounding example I saw happen in the U.S., although it may be U.S.-specific:<p>An employer (themselves a start-up with big funding) hired a new employee, offering relocation costs to bring the employee and his family across the country.   The employee was hired to lead a new project whose scope was only partially clear during the interviews - the guess was that it would probably be a 6-to-12 month project before moving on to other tasks.<p>During the few weeks of relocation process, another employee at the company realized that a simpler solution would be good enough and completed the project.   So, on day 0, the new employee was told ""Oops, we don't need you for that.  We'll try to think of something else.""<p>The company then balked at reimbursing a large percentage of the relocation costs.   They simply deleted line items from the expense report, paid out rather less than the agreed upon cap, and said (in effect) ""What, you wanna fight about it?""<p>The new employee was both the only employee actively working on a visible free software project, and the only  male with long hair.   (To be clear, the employee ""presented"" at the office in Dilbert attire: dress slacks, crisply ironed white button down nerd shirt, hair neatly tied back, etc.)<p>HR announced new policies: (1) regulation of hair length was introduced.  (2) outside-the-office work on even utterly non-competing free software projects was forbidden.  The new employee was cautioned about (1) and told, regarding (2), to take down his project's web site.<p>Now, what is the motivation of the employer here?  Money.  It's simple:<p>If the employee were fired or quit before 90 days, the employee (per contract) would owe back the relocation expenses.   On the other hand, if the employee were fired before 90 days, the employer would almost certainly be forced to defend itself against - and likely lose - a suit for having made a fraudulent job offer that cost the employee greatly.   Thus, the company had a strong financial incentive to inspire the new employee to quit in less than 90 days.<p>Beyond 90 days:  if the company fired the employee <i>for cause</i> or if the employee quit then that would be that.  On the other hand, if the company fired the employee without cause, then the company would be on the hook for the employee's unemployment benefits.   Thus, the company had a strong financial incentive to inspire the employee to quit, or to justify a <i>for cause</i> firing.<p>The pattern that started on day 0 of employment continued.  HR started dictating stricter policies on hours (while selectively applying the rules mainly to this one employee while winking at the others).  The highest level managers assigned the employee useless work and then changed their assignments frequently (to other useless work).  The employee was allocated a malfunctioning workstation.<p>The employee got the message and planned to stick it out for the 90 days and/or until finding a replacement job and then get out of dodge.   Then some mysterious things started happening:  Of all the cars in the parking lot, the new employee's somehow wound up being the one whose tire stems got cut.  A VP got in the habit of ""stalking"" the employee around the office.   A manager cornered the employee in a cubicle and menaced him with a threat of physical violence while barring the employees exit from the cubicle.  (The list goes on but those are some highlights.)<p>The last day was the one that the employee left his desk for a few minutes to make some photocopies, returned, and found that -- and I'm not kidding -- urine had been added to his drinking water.<p>Fearing for his safety, the employee left and did not return.  He later received a demand letter for the return of relocation expenses.  This being a ""your word against theirs"" situation, he had little choice but to comply.<p>The employee, in subsequent years, displays symptoms of post traumatic stress when entering cubicle-type office environments.   He was forced to declare bankruptcy after these events.<p>Short summary: if on day-0 an employer has already decided that they made a mistake and shouldn't have hired you, it may very well be the case that (for money reasons, at least) they want you to quit rather than to fire you.<p>One way to push someone towards quitting is by piling up unreasonable demands: like no outside work on free software.<p>In such situations, unless you can <i>prove</i> the fraud or any underhanded or illegal actions by the company, they hold all the cards.   ""No outside activity,"" may be nothing more than a warning shot.",1272386080
1298742,comment,1297908,1298114,0,0,imajes,,,"It's a shame I've gotten downvoted here, and you got upvoted as much. I guess hackers like the idea of hacking food too.<p>Here's the deal, though:<p>You could conceivably add the right chemicals to a pile of offal cooked in a skin of some kind and it'd taste like a gourmet sausage. You might have in fact eaten such a thing. It's also common to add flavorings such as ""grandma's special recipe"" or that from a dude in a coat from Kentucky. All these things make us think that something tastes good, which as also commented in this thread translates in your brain to mean: ""hey, this is good for you, have more!"".<p>But the reality is, what you're eating is almost certainly mechanically reclaimed meat (where carcasses with so little meat it's almost pointless to continue cutting are put through a machine which crushes, juices, minces and turns out a slushy type 'meat' goo). and MRM is the place where salmonella and other friends live. It's also not really meat: there's plenty of cartilage (aka 'gristle') and such that is cut so small, you actually ingest it. It doesn't cook properly, and it's not really good for you to eat- you just pass it. But if it's carrying salmonella or e-coli... I hope you didn't have something important to do for the next couple weeks.<p>Also, the nutrition recovery from such a meal is incredibly limited. You feel bright and happy for a short period (the msg et al) and then you have a come down, a craving, and want some more- for that high again. So in fact, what you're eating is a bunch of mind-altering chemicals ontop of a bed of processed waste.<p>Food shouldn't be like that.<p>Food should melt in your mouth and be an explosion of flavor and something you genuinely feel excited about. It should be, you have a meal, which provides you with some instant energy, and also some which is ""slow-burning"". Brown grains (rice, some wheats, etc) are great for this. You will feel full and energised for longer periods.<p>Cheap base foods are cheap because they are often subsidized (e.g.: corn) or because their most common consumer is the cattle, pigs, chickens etc that you want to eat.  This has given a false sense of price - people expect all food to be as cheap. So supermarkets etc will look to find ways to make everything else like it. So you'll see battery farmed chickens, who are so close together they often aren't able to stand up; You'll find chickens who are injected with water to make extra weight. (yeah, that chicken you just bought? probably a pound of it is water. You just paid chicken price for water).<p>Good food is good because it provides great nutrition, is often respectful of the environment and is sustainable.<p>Everything else is just yet another sign of man's dominance over everything else.<p>(BTW, no, i'm not an enviro-hippy, it's just that i refuse to eat crap if i can help it- why put yourself through that kind of thing when there's so much better choice out there?)",1272386079

On the other hand, Haskell could be taught as a first programming course.

The normal approach is for the ""parent"" object to contain a collection of its optional attributes. One would insert new attributes into this collection, and request their values from there later. Another approach you'll see, depending on the needs, is to use generics or templates to package the attribute with sidecar information that indicates whether it's actually ""there"", as with C# nullable types.<p>In newer dynamic languages like python (which is an evolution of the OO paradigm), though, this is simplicity itself. Indeed, it's at the heart of dynamic programming, and is what I referred to in my previous post when I criticized the rigidity of C++. In python, one isn't bound by the static definitions of an interface. If you want to add an additional attribute to your object, well, what are waiting for? Just go and add that attribute to it.

You see, I did it there but I won't even get any death threats.<p>Contrast with someone drawing one cartoon and actually being killed, you know, his blood splashed across the ground.<p>Also, it's one thing some kids never learn at school -- if you can't take a bit of teasing, then you get picked on. If you get picked on, you either: get miserable, get used to being teased, or become the crazy kid, the one even the bullies won't touch, who kicks and bites, and even the teachers despise.<p>But they're not in school any more, and they need to grow up.

And if you keep hitting the soft spot again and again, a few wackos from those societies will go crazy. There is no need to even goto the Qu'ran for this - just understand that every culture, every religion has soft spots which when hit hard enough, will make a few go crazy. To think that you can change these super, super minority via logic is lame.<p>To think this can change the view of a larger audience - there's nothing to change...super vast majority of Muslims are just offended when they find these stories and then go about their daily business.

So murdering one person is significant in that it affects one person <i>ultimately</i>, and a good chunk of other people in the second order. Losing one's own phone affects a single person only, and not very significantly at that. Apple's losing their prototype is analogous in the actual act, but the effect on Apple's marketing multiplies it out big-time.<p>Other test cases for the thought experiment: bank robbery; simple assault; rape; creating a public nuisance. I think the idea can be applied successfully across all of these.<p>I don't know anything specific about the stolen iPhone case. I find the whole ""zOMG I saw a picture of the new iPhone!!!1!!"" thing to be ridiculous. So I can't address anyone's behavior in this instance.",1272384028
