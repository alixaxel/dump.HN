I also like monkrb but if you check out the Padrino guides (<a href=""http://www.padrinorb.com/guides"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.padrinorb.com/guides</a>) you will see that Padrino is quite a bit more full-featured but also modular. You can enable / disable various features of Padrino and even include certain pieces in existing Sinatra apps.<p>Our team has used Rails and Sinatra both extensively for contract work and I would argue if you give Padrino + Sinatra a try that you will find it does not defeat the mentality of Sinatra. Instead Padrino simply complements the existing feature set with optional enhancements you might frequently need such as form helpers, tag helpers, localization, mailers and more.<p>I agree that community support for Sinatra and Padrino are considerably lacking in comparison to Rails. I don't think this is something that cannot be fixed however. Sinatra has only recently hit 1.0 stable which means that the community has just begun to grow. I can say our team at least is committed to helping anyone with problems associated with Sinatra/Padrino.

You might unconsciously bias your scoring to make some rejects eligible and others not. The beauty of the wildcard is that it's totally random.<p>EDIT: Another thought.

You're immediately spending money and taking runway off the table and turning it into illiquid assets.<p>So sure, raw hardware you own in a rack somewhere is probably cheaper over 18 months. But then you're still stuck with it after 18 months (whereas you can just swap out for a larger sized ec2 in the space of a few minutes, whenever you want, without penalty).<p>Then again, unless you're buying a whole cage/closet you're probably paying the top whack fee anyhow, since data centers almost always deal with negotiating on the cage/closet level - anything smaller is typically not worth it to them. So you're paying full rate for your 2u box, and sitting on hardware that's depreciating.<p>Plus, to get into the good datacenters, the ones that have provable disaster recovery, multi homed bandwidth, power and cooling , you will need to prove your creditworthiness and such. But that's OK - you'll stake all you got to get a couple cheap servers hosted somewhere that won't go down (and if it did, be trivial to heal)<p>Finally: to the point about predictable usage lowering costs: amazon already does this, with reserved instances. You give them a heads up about what you're going to need over the coming year, they'll give you a discount.<p>If distributed, fail tolerant and instant deployable are three things that describe your startup, relying on your hardware to always work, that your sysop friend is always around and that you're on top of kernel bugs seems like a pretty fast way to fail.<p>On the other hand, offload all this to a company who's doing it anyhow, and you might find that you get to extend your runway, grow with your customers (who says it is bad to deploy more servers based on customer orders??) and get to focus on more interesting things, such as where to find the next beer. :)",1270177429
