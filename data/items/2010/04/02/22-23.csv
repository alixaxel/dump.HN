1237779,comment,1237743,1237743,0,0,TodoneApp,,,"Heh, was this in response to my ""Ask HN"" earlier today? :) I agree that these list based systems are always trumped by a text file or pen/paper for portability and simplicity. However, having tried so many list-based systems as well as the ""simpler methods"", I still found myself just not getting things done. That's why I built <a href=""http://todoneapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://todoneapp.com</a>, which is really an experiment with a new methodology for doing things. The point isn't to organize you, it's to compel you to fulfill promises to yourself, in a way. This is the system I needed to help me pull weeds. Putting it down on paper wasn't helping. Building a system that allowed me to say ""I need to pull the weeds"" and at some point asking it ""What should I do now?"" to be told ""You should pull the weeds. Go away and pull the weeds."" That's what I needed. It's much easier to do something that ""someone else"" is telling you to do, than listening to yourself tell you to do it. YMMV of course. :)",1270248758

Why wouldn't they want someone to be in that situation?  In addition to that, they've probably decimated these people's credit.    I'm all for living within one's means but some of this is absurd.

1237705,comment,1236686,1237419,0,0,Dove,,,"Fair.  Of course, the whole thing is a simplistic rhetorical device; real life is complicated.<p>If you really could expect full marks in ""be a man of character"" and ""treat her right"" categories -- if you were some mythical combination of Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Jesus Christ, perhaps you <i>could</i> redeem a fairly self-centered wife.  Those are, after all, men who made their names by succeeding at redeeming evil cultures with little more than compassion and force of character.  But it'd sure be difficult and painful.  I'm not claiming things would ""work out"" easily even in the best case, and that's the worst one.  Most folks really can't expect straight A's there.  Most folks, if they're honest with themselves, are shooting for more like a C+ and maybe don't even always get there.  So in a way, how my model handles that corner case is academic.<p>My point by assigning such a low value to who you choose isn't that it doesn't matter at all -- of course it does.  Of course you can easily doom the whole thing to failure (short of heroic measures) by marrying an utterly irredeemable jerk.  My point is that it's not a relatively big contributer.  And I'm strongly of the opinion that it isn't.  Stick to quality women, or even just decent women, and the other factors dominate.<p>Over ten, fifteen, twenty years of marriage, the single largest factor in who your wife is, is who you are.  And vice versa.  Her criticisms become your defensive sore spots.  Your generocity becomes her avid interest.  Your callousness becomes her indifference.  Her complacency becomes your disinterest.  And on and on.  After many years, every groove in your soul matches a cusp in hers, and vice versa.  There's feedback.  There's resonance.  That's why the quality of your wife is <i>120% you</i>.<p>You grow to be like who you hang out with.  You rise to high expectations or sink to low ones.<p>Do you want your wife to be beautiful at 35?  It doesn't matter whether she was a 6 or 10 or 8 at 24 when you married her.  It matters whether you've been buying her jewelry, telling her her beauty is worth sacrifice and expense to you.  It matters whether you've been telling her she's beautiful, encouraging her to experiment with new shoes, or making fun of her when you find her with green goop all over her face.  It matters whether you criticize or support, because her outward appearance is a measure of her self-esteem, her confidence, and whether she thinks being pretty is a hobby worth keeping up with.<p>Do you want a sexually engaged wife?  Make sex something she loves.  Be generous.  Be romantic.  Be attentive.  And wait five years.<p>Do you want a kind and generous wife?  Be kind and generous.  Do you want a wife who understands you?  Talk to her.  Do you want a wife who is not annoyed with you all the time?  Listen to her criticism, don't defend yourself, change your behavior, explain in tenderest and most loving tones what has been misunderstood.<p>To optimize your wife, optimize yourself.  Because marriage is really long, and after just a few years, she's mostly who you've made her.<p>(Goes the other way, too.  But this place is mostly guys).",1270245983

If you squint your eyes a bit it can really seem as though Jobs wanted to look like the larger than life crusader against DRM. That’s clearly not what he is. If you think Jobs wanted people to have that impression (which is what Cory Doctorow seems to think) his actions begin to look hypocritical.",1270245631
