1287104,comment,1285885,1285885,0,0,jsz0,,,"I think it's a big step backwards. It just doesn't fit. The selling point of Linux, as a desktop OS, would be its stability, reliability, flexibility, etc. I don't think using these weird exotic colors in such inconsistent ways sells those points very well. It looks very amateurish. Of course the point is made you can change the colors/theme easily but let's face it -- lots of people are going to look at the screenshots and make huge irrational assumptions based on them. Something cleaner and more professional looking would capture the essence of desktop Linux better in my opinion. I've always liked the default CentOS theme:<p><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Centos41-desktop-en.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Centos41-...</a>",1271991441

1287101,comment,1286391,1286391,0,0,DLWormwood,,,"I ended up missing out on the first shipment of iPads to Toledo, OH due to similar caginess by my local retailer. After finding out on the evening news that the device sold out here, I visited the store in person to complain. The store owner(?) was very apologetic to me, explaining that Apple gave them a very strict script they had to follow when fielding questions before the release. They couldn't even tell me that they were getting any at all on launch day, or that even putting down my name was pointless. (In retrospect, some of their choices of wording to me over the prior month should have tipped me off to wait before the store opened.  Afterwards, the store guy confessed that they weren't even allowed to <i>recommend</i> that!)<p>Things finally did work out in the end...<p>--

I had many friends whose parents were wealty, and even more whose parents were professors. I can assure you that does not equate to automatic success.<p>Now, I'm not gonna sit here and presume to know what these two figures were thinking, but it takes a driven person to put themselves in position to take advantage of opportunity when it arises.

I wanted to say something like ""your credit card has been stolen. kthxbye."" but that would have caused some false alarms.<p>It's hard to have a memorable message without it causing offense or panic.<p>Also on my TODO: add a counter for those who put 16 digits in the credit card field.<p>Extra edit: nfriendly: Thanks for the styling suggestion.",1271988428

Putting ""This is a test, you have failed it"" right in front of folks is an <i>instant</i> turn-off, and might lead people away from your page instead of to the helpful content below.<p>More bullet points. There's not a whole lot of text there now, but anything you can do to get the message across with fewer words is a win, especially when dealing with non-technical folks.<p>Under ""look at the address bar"", you have:
<i>A common phishing trick is to have a domain like amazon.com.not.ru, which steals your credentials when you try to log in. The actual domain in this example is ""not.ru,"" but people often only check to see if the string ""amazon.com"" is anywhere in the address bar.</i><p>I'd change that to not use the word ""string"" since non-tech-folks don't parse that very well, and maybe include screenshots of an address bar containing the real Amazon.com and a phishing site disguised as Amazon.<p>Still though, good idea!",1271988345
