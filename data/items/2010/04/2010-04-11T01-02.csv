1256165,comment,1255858,1255858,0,0,glhaynes,,,"This makes an interesting thought experiment: what if Adobe decides to take on Apple directly by throwing their weight behind Apple's main competitor, Android. CS5.1 is shipped as a free upgrade to CS5 and replaces the iPhone-compiler with an Android-compiler. Organizations with existing Flash content decide that they had might as well do a quick/dirty port of their apps using CS5.1.<p>What will the results of this be?<p>* Lots of Flash content gets released on Android. This expands Android's software market considerably, though with a cost in performance/platform-integration (both in terms of UI and in terms of taking advantage of low-level capabilities).<p>* Many of the best/most popular and money-making Flash apps will get an iPhone OS-native port. The cost to write an iPhone app is relatively low; if you're talking about a game, the vast majority of the cost is usually in the assets. The iPhone developer tools are very good, there are lots of developers: finding an iPhone developer willing to make a native port of your game engine isn't difficult or expensive relative to the number of users you open up your investment to. Thus iPhone potentially gets the best version of many originally-Flash apps.<p>Thus, Android continues to have more possibilities (theoretical and, in some cases, actual), but a lower overall level of quality, integration, and performance... an issue its apps are already widely accused of. And iPhone, which has a tremendous lead in number of apps, loses out on a few — again, a fairly unpopular set which would have generally not fit in on the platform as well and would have slowed Apple's ability to require adoption of new platform capabilities.<p>It's hard to see the downside to Apple here. And it's hard to see how this does anything but make Android less attractive and iPhone more attractive for most mainstream (the overwhelming majority) users.",1270951101

1256160,comment,1255961,1255961,0,0,kullar,,,"when we started our location based site launching soon :), we researched current and future competitors:
key points we came out with: 
1. Facebook absolutely will launch a friend finder (although they'll have privacy problems and they'll have to be careful) so most friend finders will get crushed.
2. most current sites are confusing- don't actually understand what they do within 10 to 30 seconds of looking at the site. Often they do too much that people care minimally about
3. Most location based sites have missed out on some very basic needs that people have. Many seem to be built by hard geeks for other hard geeks. Go out and talk to mainstream users, they just are like wtf?
So dave has said what most people may have thought but were not willing to say because of what i think of as the 'twitter' effect'. Its the 'well, it could be another twitter, just that i don't get it yet' thought.<p>However, the one advantage foursquare etc have got over some poor muppet like me with my $6,000 dollar savings invested in our idea is lots of money and an existing infrastructure.

We don't all write in processor-specific assembler because it's not (developer-time) efficient, and because we can accomplish a given task without having to resort to such a low level. For example, it's far more efficient to write in higher-level C and compile for the platform as necessary. The entirety of the software development ecosystem is ""intermediary layers"". C compiled to a platform target with GCC is sure as hell an ""intermediary layer"".<p>I can't help but think that what Jobs means here is ""intermediary layers that aren't ours automatically produce inferior products"".

starting to change my mind. It's not the quality (Titanium mobile apps are nearly indistinguishable from most iPhone apps), the speed of development (like you said, not having to use Objective-C). Unfortunately it is probably protectionism. To protect the dominance of the AppStore. If you can simultaneously write an Android and iPhone app using the same Titanium/Kroll codebase, you're helping to weaken the AppStore (which is arguably the main tent pole of Apple's strategy to dominate computing in this century).<p>""When Apple’s SDK was introduced in July 2008, the company tried over a period of several months to get a basic app up and running. Notes Bart Johnston, Director of Interactive, “I thought that my web development experience would have prepared me for developing on the iPhone, but it felt like I was starting completely from scratch. The learning curve was very high.""<p>Does Apple really want to officially allow Titanium to lower the barrier to entry?
