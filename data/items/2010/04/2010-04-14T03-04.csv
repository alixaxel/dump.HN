As an example, let's say I have 10,000 active users per month, and from their activity, they achieve 10 things per month. At one penny per,  I would be shelling out $1000 per month for your service, $12,000 per year. Simply put, hell no. Perhaps, a better pricing plan would be in tiers with fixed costs, and notifications if one were nearing the limit of their chosen tier?<p>Also, for that $1000 alone, I could probably hire a developer to build an achievement system on my own server for my own sites.

They try to prey on fears of the economy and competition and then try to sell you an advantage over that whipped up competition, who by the way, they would sell their service to. It’s not like they are representing you to the exclusion of your competition.  After wasting 20 minutes with what I thought was a legitimate recruiter for a CTO position, I was pretty irate. Like I told the scum bag, if you are so sure of your success rate, then why don’t you let me pay your fees after placement? after all if you don’t place me, I have not benefited from your so called advantage.

And that use exploded thanks to any number of consumption-focused technologies along the way.<p>The use of the internet is deeply intertwined with its form -- television could never, even if we worked incredibly hard at it, have been used in the same way. The message is the medium, and the form of the technology we adapt does, in fact, matter significantly.<p>Example: we would absolutely not be having this little debate if we only had iPads. :)<p>(And not to start a side debate, but I'm deeply sceptical of the app store being all that revolutionary; almost everything I've seen is a usability-tweaked version of software that already existed on the desktop or web. Further, it is absolutely against ideals of decentralization when it comes to the creation of software!)",1271214693

Actually, when I started reading your post I thought to myself, ""seems like this guy just finished his chapter on Perfect Competition"".<p>Even though there are benefits and differences to high capital vs low capital requirement markets, you have to look at the human aspect of it. There are failures on both sides, and probably a higher failure rate for web startups. But the  main difference is that regular people have the opportunity to actually strike it rich. High capital requirements tend to mean you need social connections to people with money. In society, this means political, industry, venture capital, and business connections. If you're the wrong race, sex, religion, or just don't fit the profile of someone who tends to be able to have access to money, you won't get it.<p>Low capital requirement markets means anyone can play; everything is more competitive, all products are higher quality. The discriminator is the market, and thats fair for all. If you take these into consideration, than you see low capital requirement markets are in fact a blessing, regardless of the economic returns of high capital markets. They are two completely different beasts.",1271214513

Read the Ars link I posted for details.<p>2) All of these companies and developers have been following the rules only to just now have them changed on them for utterly shitty reasons.<p>3) Apple isn't enforcing their own rules. Lots of apps break the rules yet are allowed on the store. Their rules, at this point, amount to: we're gonna let you in if we like you. That's a pretty crummy rule; hope your business plan doesn't depend on it.<p>4) You're missing half the perspective. Apple should be grateful to the developers who have worked their asses off and bent over backwards to satisfy Apple's various restrictions to fill their store with lots of software. If Apple treats them poorly, they'll find developers choosing other platforms.",1271214336

1) it seems to implicitly assuming (without realizing it) that any two graphs it is considering at k-regular for some unspecified k.  This  is barely more general than assuming that graphs are planar, so itd be easy to have pretty reasonable algorithm for such a case (i'm pretty sure there are bunches in the research literature).<p>Also, it doesn't really seem to be addressing integrality of the linear programs, which i think is kinda key when using linear programs for combinatorics!",1271214256
