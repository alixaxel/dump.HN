1245470,comment,1244967,1245144,0,0,sorbits,,,"The reason for this advice is that the employer and the employee often have a number in mind when they enter the room. If the employee starts with a number below what the employer had in mind, the employer accepts it. If it is too high, the employer will suggest something lower, and the employee at least can’t go higher, and will likely end up lower than the number he gave.<p>So you could say a better advice is to say your number first, but make it 150% of your actual number.<p>On a related topic, a lot of tech guys I know undersell themselves. I have two employees and I asked both of them to go first, for the first one, I gave him more than he asked for :)",1270583957

That overreach is the mechanism by which ""neutrality"" could be subtly redefined, over time, by the next generation of righteous busybodies.<p>Without strict by-the-letter-of-the-law limits, future populist regulators could easily decide that packets aren't truly ""neutral"" unless they advance neutrality, equality, and justice for all Americans. Packets which contain hate speech, pornography, anonymous speech, content inaccessible to the handicapped, political campaigning beyond the spending limits of the FEC, or an insufficient proportion of 'underrepresented' viewpoints all twist the net against the public interest. So why shouldn't fair-minded regulators issue extra rules to protect us? Demand more proof of compliance and 'good faith' from operators to stay in business? And once an agency is reviewing business practices for compliance with political ideals, where does it stop?<p>The diversity of political viewpoints available from a mass media is roughly inversely correlated with the amount of government regulation. Broadcast TV -- requiring FCC licenses for using the ""public"" airwaves -- has the tamest commentary. Cable TV -- federally-unregulated but locally-licensed, with a lot of operator overlap with regulated broadcasting -- is slightly more diverse. Books and periodicals -- there is no FCC of print, thankfully -- are the most diverse.<p>Right now the internet is most like books and periodicals. Anything that gives the FCC review power over net businesses will push it to be tamer, more like cable or broadcast. (This is even if there are no explicit content regulations; simply trying to keep the bipartisan regulators on your good side with regard to future disputes means self-censorship.)<p>Even if you think that's a risk worth taking for ""neutrality"", you ought to at least require that authority to come from explicit legislation. Get a clear definition of new rules and authorities in writing; have that definition pass Congress and constitutional review. Don't let an appointed agency of 3 Dems/2 Reps (and sometimes, 3 Reps/2 Dems) assign themselves this new authority.",1270580425
