They've added video codecs at least three times in the past.<p>All those codecs have been bought in so it's not NIH syndrome. One of them was VP6! And if you think they're allergic to open source codecs then note they just adopted Xiph's Speex as a better alternative to NellyMoser for voice a year or so ago. I'm sure they appreciate not having to pay licence fees as much as the next giant corporation, and understand that customers appreciate that too.<p>(edit: just realised the post I'm replying to is actually saying something different i.e. that existing Flash video is often H.264 and so can be moved to HTML5 without touching the video file itself. I think the point is that Google doesn't want to move from Flash to HTML5, they want to move from royalty-bearing codecs to open source and open standard friendly codecs, so yes replacing those H.264 files is required regardless.

1267310,comment,1266723,1266930,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Starting a company in Canada among 2 or 3 people is easy. I should know because I did it when I was a teenager. It cost me $15 for some incorporation templates, $150 for a name search report showing potentially similar company names to the one I wanted to start, and $350 or so in government fees. This got me a company incorporated provincially. You can do it federally too but it's a bit more complex. If you have as much money as you claim you could probably emigrate to Canada in a special business class meant specifically for people starting businesses here.<p>Starting businesses is easy as pie. If you have enough money to sustain the business before it brings in revenue then I'm not sure what the attraction is to these sort of ventures. If your execution is good then VCs will hear you out regardless of whether you've been ""accepted"" into a program like this. They may facilitate introductions but there are also government funded programs here in Canada that do not charge money which will do the same.<p>Tax rates for people smart enough to start businesses in Canada are fairly attractive. It is especially so when you factor in healthcare costs or lack-there-of. However one thing to bear in mind is that it is often a severe hassle an American company to exit an investment in a Canadian company. In some cases it would require 900 signatures of limited partners in the American company and for each to file Canadian income taxes. Google ""Section 116 foreign investment"". It is something the government here is tackling in a bid to spur VC investment in Canada. But there are still some gotchas (and benefits) to starting a company here.",1271320772

1267259,comment,1267058,1267123,0,0,plinkplonk,,," I think Section 3.3.1 is good for hackers in a very different way than explained in the blog post. Good hackers will (by and large) follow the law for their <i>commercial</i> endeavours rather than try to work around Apple's insane (and ever shifting) policies. I for one wouldn't set out to build a <i>business</i> based on explicitly breaking the law and with the <i>possibility</i> of a lawsuit looming.<p>That said, the IPad, IPhone and AppStore have raised the bar for UI design, user installation, sales (and payment) processing and so on where there is now a clearly defined ""what hackers  want"" gap in the ecosystem.  The Apple AppStore is an existence proof of what is possible and this is orthogonal to languages used and so  on (as demonstarted by games using Unity3D).<p>Hackers want to build their  own languages that compile down to the ""native"" language and APIs but they also  want the AppStore style payment processing and so on with better facilities for updating our apps, a faster and more comprehensive review cycle (assuming that a review is a good thing) and so on.<p>If someone (Google? Microsoft?  someone totally new? ) were to fill this gap (and someone eventually will), it will be ""good for hackers"". Section 3.3.1 is good insofar as it will spur development of alternative ecosystems and force disgruntled hackers off the Apple path. No one who <i>has a choice</i> and wants to stay within the bounds of the law will accept such inane terms and conditions. Microsoft had far less onerous  policies and far less competition than Apple in the mobile space, and yet, over many years there was a drain of top class developers from MS's platforms to Linux/BSD and later to Apple. Once upon a time MS was the <i>only</i> game in town for commercial projects. The advent of teh Web and Open Source changed that game. The same scenario, with different players and technology,  will play out with Apple, but it won't be instant and will take a while.",1271318406
