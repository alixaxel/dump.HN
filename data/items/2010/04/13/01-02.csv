I think opera have nailed the tab switching UI, its so much quicker to use then safari.<p>Couple of things I dont like<p>- They've implemented their own copy/paste controls. I guess this is nessesary due to the 'long click' for opening new tabs etc, but its kind of annoying.<p>- Not really Opera's fault but because of the new useragent, alot of sites deliver the 'normal' mobile version of their site instead of the iphone version I'm used to (usually much prettier).",1271123751

1260970,comment,1258916,1259423,0,0,anatta,,,"Your analogy of meditation being like riding into the woods is great. Its only flaw, however, is in the assertion that both meditation and psychedelic experience arrive at the same mental state. Minus that, likening meditation to progressive, incremental bicycle trips into the forest is accurate and sets a person up wonderfully to begin the discipline.<p>Psychedelic drugs provide an experience of absorption like a trance. When one is absorbed in such a state, it's the first direct experience of a sense of self that is immaterial (but finite). Buddhist meditation (samadhi or ""right concentration"" in the Noble Eightfold Path) goes very far beyond that and into very different states of consciousness.<p>Gil Fronsdal is a Stanford Ph.D who teaches clearly, logically, and in stepwise progression.

Luckily, creating confidence is easy, you just fake it until it catches on. Sure, you can read more in-depth articles about ""finding things you like about yourself"" and ""positive mantras"", but if you just go out intending to appear confident, you will in fact become confident. I pay a lot of attention to the way that people speak. If you stutter and say ""um"" or ""uh"" a lot, you will sound unimpressive regardless of the topic.<p>The other comments in this thread have the books nailed down. ""How to win friends and influence people"" and ""Influence"" are largely considered the best books on the topic. I'm very interested in body language which is very related.

It was clear to me from the start that MM (now Adobe) had made a bad move with Flex because all the examples reimplemented basic HTML form + JS functionality in Flash, with a bonus ""Loading"" window at the start.<p>I know a lot of otherwise bright devs that were drawn to Flex by the MVC paradigms that littered the tutorials. Classic 'Architecture Astronaut' stuff as Spolsky would describe it which really didn't translate to delivery of better sites for users, especially once the JS frameworks took off.<p>In my view, the decision to trade off user experience and established standards for developer convenience is never the right one, but I guess it's a temptation if you're in the dev tools business.",1271123161

In other words, re-implementing an inverted index in SQL is waste of time when you can use tools like Sphinx and Lucene - which are highly optimized to do inverted indexes and that can easily handle 2 billion words. The same can be said about FlockDB - it's possible to emulate a graph database, but is the effort really worth it when there are such tools like Redis and neo4j which seem to be optimized for graph like structures.",1271120850

Much snappier than Safari; the difference is very noticeable.<p>2. pages download much quicker<p>3. zooming in and out is faster, but you only have two zoom levels. If you ""pinch to zoom"" it immediately zooms in all the way.<p>4. the home screen with 9 favorites works great<p>5. it's a little buggy (clicks don't always register)<p>6. killer feature #1: it automatically stores the entire app state, so you can open a few tabs, switch apps, go back and have everything the way you left it. This is a big deal, because Safari forgets your pages eventually, which is so frustrating when you have your travel plans in a safari tab and 3G is not exactly reliable.<p>7. killer feature #2: you can save pages<p>8. In full screen mode it makes for a pretty decent reader.<p>9. It doesn't suffer from ""too small font"" syndrome.<p>10. It has this ""Snap to column"" thing where your view automatically snaps to the column edges. This makes reading more like reading on Instapaper and less like safari.<p>11. It loads instantly, even when I have 3 tabs open. It's really that fast.<p>The only real downsides I know of so far are that it has trouble rendering more complex web pages, invades my privacy and doesn't do Javascript. Flash content simply doesn't appear (so you don't even know it should be there) and YouTube links don't link to the YouTube app. Still very impressive.",1271120800
