Jobs has always been about the opposite -- and for good reason; the early Macs were typically more stable and functioned better simply because of that lock-in.<p>But history has played this over and over again, and Woz always wins.  Vendors work out standards; the user experience consolidates.<p>If you give people the freedom and trust them, they'll work it out.  Or you can trust a benevolent dictator to work it out for you.  Most Apple afficianados will say the most people don't want that freedom; I'm here to tell you that they do.<p>We don't have to debate.

I don't object to promiscuity; I object to delusional promiscuity. Having experience with it, I wanted to say that it is a lot more glamourous on paper than in real life.<p>Ignoring the ""vapid"" nature of it all, I failed to include one of my personal most important lessons: sex for women, even if ostensibly casual, is <i>rarely</i> consequence free. They are wired differently. Occasionally you'll get a girl who just wants a meaningless night, but more often than not, they'll pretend they are okay with it while hoping for more. Considering the pickup artist community has rules about (effectively) going on three dates, it is misleading if you are only after sex.<p>That being said, it's not like me being in shape and telling fat people to work out more.

The valuation determines what percentage ownership you end up giving up in exchange for the funding. The total amount you end up with is negotiable.<p>2) The VC takes a percentage ownership of your company, and generally ends up with a seat on your board, Officer salaries are generally determined by the board. As the founder, you usually specify your salary requirements during the fund raising process....an overly large salary is a red flag and could turn investors off. The total amount of control the investors end up with depends on your specific situation.<p>3) Usually it is done as one big check. However, it may be split up into 'tranches', which are delivered upon meeting certain milestones.<p>4) Most startups do end up failing, the investors know the risks associated and factor that in their decisions about what companies to fund. If it fails, it fails. The fact that your company is a separate legal entity protects you from personal liability.<p>5) Generally investors end up taking a 20%-40% ownership stake in your company per round. If you raise multiple rounds, each new investor takes a new slice of the pie.<p>I would definitely recommend checking out the sites I linked above to get a much more thorough overview of the fundraising process.

Their take is determined by the pre-money valuation and the amount given. A web startup might be able to sell 20% of the company for $1 million, implying a $4m pre-money valuation. Biotech startups typically give up 90-95% in order to get $20-40m invested.<p>VCs will want to know where their money is spent, and generally want the CEO to pay himself $125-175k. Paying the CEO a million, if not vetoed, would quickly ruin the relationship with the VCs, which you do not want to break.<p>Also, and this cannot be stressed enough: <i>watch out</i> for downright evil terms such as participating preferred and multiple liquidation preferences. VCs usually ask for a 1x liquidation preference, meaning that they take out their investment at par before anyone else gets paid. (This only makes sense, because otherwise you could sell on a down round, liquidating but screwing the VC). However, evil VCs will ask for a multiple. So, on $4m invested, the liquidation preference might be $8 million, meaning that if you sell at $7.5 million, you get nothing. Another evil term is participating preferred, which means that they get an equity-based share <i>after</i> taking the liquidation preference. So if you take $2 million for 40% of your company at 2x with participating preferred, then sell at $8 million, the VC gets $4 million plus 40% of the remainder ($5.6 million) instead of the $3.2 they deserve-- and you, the founders, just got ripped off. These kinds of terms exist because, although there are a lot of great VCs, there are also a lot of silver-spoon entitled shits who actually believe they deserve that sort of thing for the gift of their existence.",1270668646

I do think men are more stoic about dealing with minor problems in life (in general), but that has to do with how they express it, not how well they actually deal with it.<p>I also tend to find that men, in general, are less wordy, especially about emotional topic, but I think that is less about men being better at nonverbal communication.

This doesn't mean they do it for communication, they do it for affirmation of the relationship.<p>I will agree that, in general, women are more interested in feelings and relationships then men, but not because these are simple things or unimportant, or even that most men see them that way.

Men are better at stoically shrugging off the minor problems of life.<p>Also, men are better at nonverbal communication. If a friend has good news or bad news it's sufficient for me to say ""Hey, congrats!"" or ""Bummer, that sucks dude"", and we both know exactly where we stand. There's no need to spend several thousand words on agreeing with each other on exactly how good or bad the news is.<p>edit: Also, men and women find different things interesting. Women are far more interested in ""feelings"" and ""relationships"" as complicated objects worthy of discussion, whereas men see them as simple things unworthy of too much brainpower and would much rather think about ""things"" or ""ideas"". This explains why groups of men and groups of women will choose to talk about the things they find interesting, and why many man-woman conversations are doomed to be deathly boring to one partner or the other.",1270667369

But I am especially impressed with the Joy Of Clojure by fogus (a HN'er) - From what I have read so far (which is the first 4 chapters in the MEAP) - they are taking a different approach to teaching Clojure. They are emphasizing the philosophy of Clojure - so they attempt to explain the ""why"" as well as the ""how"". Having played with some Clojure this definitely helps to bring somethings into perspective.<p>I would recommend picking up the PragProg book (if for no other reason than it's the only complete Clojure book out there) and ""The Joy of Clojure"".
