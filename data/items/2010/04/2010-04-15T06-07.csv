Some are also slowly (no stats yet) converting to paid customers.<p>2) I had already my company so this was not an issue. The only thing I had to do was to get a merchant account and a payment processing gateway. It took a bit of time but it was way easier than expected.<p>3) No way, the customer service is telling you were you need to code and in my case helps my development momentum.

With a decent landing page with the paid option you could probably start out around a 0.5% - 1% +- conversion rate, and improve from there with some intense A/B testing.

1. Partner with a small company that has a popular paper day-planner but no technology. Grow together and cross-pollinate. 
2. Partner with a huge company that has a popular paper day-planner but whose technology is lacking. 
3. Partner with another planning company, Apiggo (ToDo) and work out a deal to play off each other's strengths somehow
4. Add team-tasking and sell that version to businesses

1267161,comment,1267012,1267012,0,0,riffraff,,,"it seems simple which is good, but it also seems way too simple.  Some suggestions<p>* I understand why you want to list A->B and B->A separately, but I'd say it should be the default that someone is able to translate both ways, so favour the common case and let users correct it later.<p>* Also, If I am fluent in N languages, I must list all the individual pairs, but it seems unlikely someone able to translate english to swedish and english to norwegian wont be able to do swedish to norwegian too.
I'd say ""list languages you can work with, then review pairs"" is a better option.<p>What is there to guarantee the quality of the translation? I0've seen the stars, but they only make sense after a translator has worked for a long time.
* Couldn't translators at least link/list previous works in the language pair? 
* Could we have some kind of meta-moderation? Say, each translator from lang x/y is randomly given a snippet of someone else's translation and can rate it. 
* Couldn't we have preventive moderation? Request translation of a tiny text for some non-profit org, say, two sentences of wikipedia, and submit it to other translators for validation (or just check it's not google translate's output)<p>I've seen abhorrent translations between niche languages (e.g. hungarian & italian) because the customer has no way to tell if the translation is good, and usually does not even have structure in place to _collect feedback about it_.<p>This means there is not even the chance of going back post facto to take back your money/improve your translation/give bad rating. In practice this translates into a perfect market for lemons<p>Finally: technical writing is not marketing writing, nor literature, nor drama and especially not legal speak, I believe listing categories in which you are confident is much needed.<p>But all in all, I wish you the best luck and these are mostly minor nitpicks :)",1271313346

While their misfortune has certainly hurt people, myself included, Bootup is a great addition to the Vancouver startup ecosystem. 3 new companies is far better than 0 in my books. They also throw fantastic events and mentor many more entrepreneurs than they fund.<p>I was trying to put together a real-estate deal for a Bootup coworking space in December, but in January - when I assume the funding round fell apart - Boris (Mann) became quite scarce. I'm over it. They took on an uphill battle and are hustling to keep the business alive. I think they deserve credit for surviving when others might have folded. As a member of the Vancouver startup community, I'm happy to still have them around.
