As a matter of fact, I think it's quite likely they said 'oh cool, that sounds very web 2.0, like google for Grog'.<p>Where we differ is that I don't think they're infringing. ____gle is such a common suffix in English that I don't think it's sufficiently unique for Google to claim ownership of it.

Since such cameras do not actually have real shutters, the equivalent effect of a shutter is achieved by delaying the time that each line is exposed and read. Because cheap CCDs do not have multiple channels, the lines are read one at a time in sequence. The maximum speed that the lines may be read sequentially is the maximum ""shutter speed"" of the camera.<p>The other is the traditional curtain shutter of an SLR. Even a high-end CMOS multi-channel sensor will still see a slit of light on any speed upwards of 250, even though the data is not necessarily read a line at a time.<p>Thus, whereas the sensor in an SLR is exposed via a slit of light at higher shutter speeds, cheaper non-SLR cameras are <i>always</i> exposed one line at a time.

To their credit, Microsoft has made large strides in getting users to upgrade, but as reported in the past a lot of corporate customers are unwilling to upgrade.  I'm sure a lot of people on the IE team would like to see IE6 die as much as the rest of us.",1272511089

IE <i>is</i> the greatest source of dev-rage in web development. I personally appreciate the level of attention that IE has been getting lately, but we're still fighting with the old versions, waiting for them to drop off.<p>It's not fair at all to take it out on individuals on the IE team or do something stupid like threaten physical violence (and I'd fully support someone being called out for that), but letting people rant at your organization as a whole keeps people sane. Leaving Posterous because a designer finally hit a boiling point in frustration? That's just as bad.<p>FWIW, I can appreciate how hard it is to work on a team where you're fighting both the legacy of your old products and the decades-old impression of Microsoft as anti-web. Every version reduces the amount of frustration we encounter and every version that drops off makes us all that much happier. We're glad to see IE join the forefront of the browser race again. :)",1272510304

Government spending is around 20% of GDP, the income tax rates are comparable to the USA, but the property tax rate is sky high - up to as much as 15%.
