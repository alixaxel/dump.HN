I doubt they want to compete head-to-head with AdMob selling low value ads to diet pill web sites and punch the monkey scams. More likely they'll have a short list of exclusive deals for mobile advertising mostly with Fortune 500 companies. Apple could have had AdMob if they wanted them. I get the feeling they were never fully committed to the idea of becoming a dumb ad aggregator and that's ultimately why they passed on AdMob. If we want to get really cynical maybe Apple never had <i>any</i> interest in AdMob. They simply wanted to provoke Google into making what looks like an anti-competitive acquisition. They know Google, like Microsoft, has the war chest to buy first and think later. Did Google really need AdMob? It seems to me Google could have murdered AdMob in-house with the leverage they already have with AdSense/AdWords. Maybe Apple's plan from the start was to go the premium route and just wanted to distract Google with what appeared to be a more direct threat.",1271389208

If your app uses a well-understood (by you), proven (by others) software stack and you've been testing well enough, your worries may be for naught.<p>Some folks around here recommend tools like pingdom.

I'm looking forward to an enlightening discussion about this.<p>I was disappointed by the end, however, because it suggested that downvoting was a way of managing trolls.  I think downvoting means different things to different people:  some downvote to merely show disagreement, for example.  So a downvoted comment on Hacker News does not necessarily mean that it is likely a troll comment.  Therefore, downvotes can't achieve the necessary shared awareness.<p>(I will disagree with myself and note that comments that have been voted all the way down to -4 tend to be trollish, so maybe it works to an extent.)",1271387004
