For companies that don't have stable capex, the FCF will be more lumpy, because it doesn't allow for depreciation.

If short term cash is growing while their bills are getting higher, but this is not reflected in FCF, Net Income is a better metric because it avoids this temporal distortion.<p>Of course, if you think the hype is going to continue for a while, there is no reason not to buy into the momentum and make a short term buck, it's just not a good basis for a 10 year buy and hold as recommended by the original post.",1262796018
