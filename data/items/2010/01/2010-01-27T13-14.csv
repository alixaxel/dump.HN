Newsday's print readers (even before the Cablevision takeover) are the readers most likely to be still consuming print -- they skew older, less affluent, and less educated.<p>Newsday's only competitive advantage content-wise, relative
to the other NY papers, are hyper-local Long Island politics, culture listings, and classifieds. There just isn't any overlap between people interested in these things and people who consume most of their news online (AND are willing to pay for it).",1264600796

If you haven't taken a peek at it in a while, now would be a good time to look. Significant whitespace and optional parentheses for method calls have finally gotten settled in together, and things are nice and cozy. Some syntax examples ...<p>jQuery:<p><pre><code>    $('a').click (event) ->
      event.preventDefault()
      $(this).hide ""slow""

    $.get ""test.json"", (data) ->
      alert ""Data Loaded: "" + data

Poignant Guide:<p><pre><code>    ['toast', 'wine', 'cheese'].each (food) -> print food.capitalize()

    wish: this.read().detect (thought) -> thought.index('wish: ') is 0

</code></pre>

Not NYC/LA abysmal, but for a town of its size, truly awful.<p>- weather is grey/overcast and misty (most years) for 10 months.<p>- it's hard to attract/keep talent with families -- home prices near good schools, within short commute of downtown (or eastside) core are high.  Wages are somewhat high, but get eaten up fast if you buy a home.<p>- business taxes, fees. State/county government is bloated and seems very willing to sacrifice job creation for revenue (read: more taxes on the way).<p>- did I mention the weather?  Went back for thanksgiving -  culture shock. Weather was overcast and I was struck by how dark it is.  Light at 9am-ish and starts to get dark at 3:30.<p>There's a reason Seattle runs on caffeine.<p>(edit: thought I had this bulleted list thing down - alas, no)",1264600013
