Since I am in school right now, I am the one who is not working on this idea full time. Because of that, winter break and summer break is crucial for me to keep the progress up. However, I got an internship offer from IT company X (a well-known one) for summer break about 3 months. It is my first internship in a well-known company and I really take serious about this because it is a kind of proof to my family that I can get an offer from industry if I want, so that they can support me for the startup (I expect to graduate and work on this full time in next year).

It's a balancing act with multiple factors, as with most tax considerations.  Add in month-to-month cash flow uncertainty, and ""reasonable"" becomes very elastic very quickly.<p>Pure speculation, but I'd wager that the amount of tax avoided by small business owners by underpaying salaries is likely dwarfed by those avoided by the owners of bigger companies, who have the combined benefits of lobby power and armies of accountants figuring out loopholes for them.

Sometimes it takes up all my nights and weekends and other times I don't touch it for weeks.

Many of the people I talked to that supported China's  handling of things (or were themselves Chinese) disagreed with me on a fundamental value basis which you can't argue. I value human rights far, far above nationalism, yet those people did not. I simply do not see how they could do that, and, I'm guessing, they can't see how I could consider human rights more important than national pride. The Internet is mostly ruled the by United States and Europe - if the word 'ruled' is even applicable. Anyway, the US and Europe tend to share the idea of human rights > nationalism, and are thus pushing it in other places too.<p>Now, my opinion. I don't think you can go with the 'he just has a different view than you, everyone's view is good' thing here. I think there is a 'good view' and a 'bad view' - where the ""goodness"" of a view is characterized by long term societal benefit and societal contentment.

Why is there a need to suppress information? Because people are unhappy. Clearly, the current system of suppression isn't working perfectly. In fact, it isn't working perfectly <i>by definition</i>, since if everyone were happy, this wouldn't be needed. (By my definition, of course.)<p>Now, I realize that my point of view may sound biased - incredibly so. Maybe even something along the lines of ""I'm right because the things I say are better"". But you say: ""Just because it's different doesn't mean you must kill it."" You don't <i>have</i> to, but perhaps it will be better for the world as a whole if you do?<p>I'd love to hear your counterargument if you're willing to write another sentence about china.

They're shutting down a huge scam.<p>Sole proprietors, LLC owners, and partnership members pay self-employment tax, which replaces the employee and the employer's share of FICA.<p><i>Every employee in the nation</i> pays FICA, whether they work at Starbucks or Goldman Sachs.<p>S-Corp owners elude this tax --- which everyone else has to pay --- by claiming unnaturally low salaries. Only the salary is eligible for self-employment tax. The remainder of the S-Corp owner's comp is disbursed directly as a distribution (think ""profit-sharing""), and is for no good reason exempt from self-employment tax.<p>Whatever you may think of Social Security (Forbes: clearly not a fan), it is unfair that a shift manager at Starbucks should have to pay a tax that a 6-figure-income small business owner gets to walk away from.<p>I say this as the co-owner of a profitable small business.",1263934983

(One could argue that Americans, myself included, are exceptionally good at this actually!)  This recent wave of controversy is about what China does outside of China.<p>I would expect the same outcry to occur if any other country was staging the type of operations the PRC regularly conducts in foreign infrastructure.  Frankly, the fact that outcry is so long in coming is the only thing that surprises most people in security.<p>I agree that people need to be careful to not go overboard, but your assertion that no one should ever be critical of China because they're different is equally absurd.
