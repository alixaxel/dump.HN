1090855,comment,1089919,1090427,0,0,jdowdell,,,"That ""Player 9.4"" is a bit of an odd bird. Nokia was insistent, a few years ago, on showing the world's real webpages on a pocket device -- they were the first to want to do desktop-style browsers and plugins, rather than Flash applications or native UIs on mobile. I didn't believe it could be done, but I did use an N700 when it became available.<p>From what I understand, Nokia adapted an older Adobe Linux codebase to the smaller device, and implemented it as a plugin to their browser. Nokia is currently a major partner in the Open Screen Project, and is poised to take advantage of the mobile optimizations in the upcoming Player 10.1 release.<p>So, oddly, I'd tend to agree with the earlier poster, than we haven't seen fruits of Mobile Flash work recently. But now in Jan10, it's almost showtime.... ;-)",1264964364

1090843,comment,1090562,1090562,0,0,lincolnq,,,"I guess if I had five days to produce a ""tech discovery"" document like you describe for a non-technical audience, it would be breaking down the tasks and providing detailed estimates. Software estimation is very hard; I'm no good at it, but when I've been close to the mark, it's been because I broke down the tasks into 1- or 2-day chunks.<p>If I were to work on it, I would start by reading their wireframes and building a mental model -- at a high level, how the app must work. Then, if applicable, I would search for libraries which will save lots of time; the presence of an important library may pull me strongly towards certain languages, platforms, or architectures.<p>Once I had decided on platform and architecture (not in stone), I would start writing out the details of the tech into a document. I would put in all the technical stuff I thought I might need at first, because it's more for me to build my model right now than to give to the client. I'd spend two or three days on this, focusing on identifying the risks. If the risk is huge or easy to research, I would research it at this time and see how to mitigate it. I would also not be shy about calling them up if I think I might have a misunderstanding, as a few minutes on the phone might save hours or days.<p>Anyway, the last step is to distill the document for the audience. At this point I should have all the information to produce a document that includes an estimate, risk analysis and implementation plan.<p>[Edit: I probably sound obnoxious by using ""I would"" everywhere rather than ""you should"".

They are small because they have to be consistent or investors freak out, so the actual earnings aren't distributed anyway. I'd personally rather not have dividends for several reasons:<p>1. the stock price should accurately reflect the earnings of the firm. When a dividend is announced, the price of the stock decreases by the amount of the dividend. If you want some of those earnings, then sell a share. There's no need for the company to issue a dividend. This is a common misconception most people have.<p>2. You're taxed on the dividend payments (exceptions tax deferred retirement accounts). This is annoying, especially if you don't want them now and would rather have them just reinvested. Ignoring taxes, the value to the shareholder is the same regardless of whether dividends are paid or not.<p>My professors in finance all go on long rants against paying dividends, and it really does seem that they're antiquated.  Most newer firms just don't pay dividends, and tech companies just happen to be newer firms usually. It's not necessary a property of just tech companies.",1264963584

Immutability is the big thing.<p>In FP, you typically ""change"" a data structure by creating a shallow copy of it with a few parts replaced, but the rest just pointing back to the original - nothing's changed directly, and when data is no longer used, it's eventually garbage collected. (Typically, with a generational and/or copying collector, whose costs are proportional to surviving data.)<p>This works better with trees and lists than it does arrays and hash tables, because changes to those usually require adjusting <i>as a whole</i>. To add to the head of a linked list, you can just create a new cell of [new value, head of old list], which is very cheap. (Adding to the tail can be done with e.g. a deque). At the same time, anything that adds to the list won't interfere with other code that is holding a reference to the same list, or even accessing it concurrently.<p>Probably the best way to learn about purely functional data structures is from the book of the same name by Chris Okasaki.",1264963091

Probably, because low prices are good, and if you don't want junk, you can go elsewhere.
