If you are in your 20s, or early 30s, you are probably wasting your best dating years away.<p>I like to work hard/play hard and NYC seems the perfect place to do it.  In SV, you work hard/get more bored. You are surrounded by boring suburbs.  SF is fun for a while, but good luck finding dateable girls.  (If you are into hipster chicks, it is perfect).
Eventually work hard without corresponding fun becomes tedious, and people burn off, and move on.<p>NYC seems to have a better balance.  When people leave NYC, (or Manhattan), they seem to settle for the cheaper boroughs, or New Jersey / RI.  
When people leave SF/SV, they just move away.<p>Fred Wilson should start emphasizing this more in his posts. He doesn't realize how bad the 'dating' situation is here, and just be in a city where you meet lots of well educated girls, is a huge perk for many single 20s-30something engineers.<p>Ps.

To do subpixel smoothing correctly, you need to be able to keep the total amount of color the same -- so if you want to move a part of the glyph right one, you'd light up a red from the next pixel right and turn off blue on the last pixel in your line on the left. This becomes both much harder and less useful when not all pixels have all colors.<p>But you are right on the other point -- at 800x480 on a 3.7 inch screen has a ppi of 250 -- or just normal font rendering looks as smooth as subpixel rendering on a computer screen, and I for one would be hard pressed to distinguish between subpixel rendering and normal when looking at text at size 10 or so on that screen -- just because I'd have such a hard time seeing it at all.<p>I wish we could get proper OLED computer screens.",1263958457

In particular, it can happen that (1) <i>everyone</i> wants to give some money to the poor but (2) if they all have to do it individually (rather than a universal tax) no one will do it. This will happen, for instance, if everyone strongly dislikes being worse off than their neighbours, but weakly prefers that the poor be helped. (This is the same idea as in the familiar situations of ""prisoners' dilemma"" and ""tragedy of the commons"". It's also why some sports have officially-enforced requirements for safety measures: everyone's better off if everyone's protected, but if it's optional then that's at best an unstable equilibrium because a player or team that chooses to forgo the protection may get an advantage over those who don't. But once no one is protected, all those competitive advantages go away and everyone's worse off than if everyone had been protected.)<p>Now, if (as your second paragraph suggests) you really believe that taxation is so fundamentally evil that it cannot be justified whatever its good consequences, then of course the above will leave you entirely unmoved. But if you are prepared to consider trading off harms against benefits, then I don't think you're entitled to dismiss the possibility that some redistributive taxation is a good thing overall; in particular, you can't just say ""if people want to give money to the poor then let them do so"" unless you have good reason to think that the sort of situation I described above doesn't obtain.",1263957119

Sort of a server-side ""DOM diff"" structured with JSON, allowing a higher level of description than just spurting out some Javascript or an array of data.<p>Wow, that was way too many tacky web 2.0 terms for one paragraph.. forgive me.",1263956612

It's really hard to make the world a laboratory, though it does <i>sometimes</i> happen by accident.  The differences between N and S Korea, E and W Germany, China and Taiwan, I think, settled the question of Communism vs. Capitalism.  But good luck in getting the grant money to set up such an experiment.  I've pointed out that the USA itself is really a quite corrupt, thieving, murderous entity, but this hasn't really mattered that much.  Another example?  Nazi Germany.  They had a ridiculous war economy, they sent all their young men to butcher people, they imprisoned millions of citizens and foreigners, they had brutal police and internal security, etc, etc.  All the worst possible things.  Worse than Cameroon could possibly aspire to.  And yet the country was prosperous almost to the end of the regime.  And this was coming off the heels of the worst historical instances of hyperinflation, depression, and world war.  All of which were <i>also</i> caused by politicians.<p>That's a <i>lot</i> of bad government but it ultimately didn't matter at all.",1263956509
