Which, today, is pretty close to $0.<p>Also, increasingly, facts are self-reported by the audience.  Who needs an international bureau when they can simply search for native sources?

Science is great!<p>On the other hand, though I rarely cite Zed Shaw, I have a special fondness for the theme of his classic article ""Programmers Need to Learn Statistics or I Will Kill Them All"":<p><a href=""http://zedshaw.com/essays/programmer_stats.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zedshaw.com/essays/programmer_stats.html</a><p>... and I used to review journal articles, so I can't resist nitpicking by pointing out that some of these conclusions are a lot more dubious than others. For example, this sentence:<p><i>For women, a smile isn’t strictly better: she actually gets the most messages by flirting directly into the camera...</i><p>Appears to be based on the difference between 9.1 new monthly contacts and 9.3 new monthly contacts in each category. Is that statistically significant? I rather doubt it. The correct conclusion here is almost certainly ""making a flirty face is not significantly more effective than smiling, <i>and</i> you have to be sure to do it into the camera or the result will be a disaster, so smiling might be the more reliable tactic.""<p>Of course, if you <i>really</i> want to start picking nits you can bring up the need for some kind of multifactor analysis to correct for the fact that certain kinds of pictures are probably correlated with certain kinds of personalities. But that would go beyond what <i>I</i> understand. And it's not actually necessary to try for a Ph.D. every time you throw up a graph or two.<p>Good fun!

A manic crazy group of Peruvian girls brought me home from a nightclub to their party. Okay, we had a nice night, but in the morning - seeing the girls without their hair, makeup, looking hungover - it's like, wow, highly sexualized doesn't mean beautiful. It just means highly sexualized, which comes from a lot of work on her part. But as you saw in the Okcupid article, highly sexualized draws men's attention - ""flirty face"", the Myspace pose, etc.<p>But getting one of those flirty, sexualized girls doesn't mean higher quality! It just means you got a girl who put work into appearing highly sexualized, which if anything, is  the sign of maybe a fun fling but not a quality girlfriend.<p>Me, I stopped looking for that, and started looking more for just decent quality skin, a walk with some energy in it, awareness in her eyes, and so on. You can always teach a girl how to dress and make herself up to your tastes, which I did for my last serious girlfriend who was getting her PhD in physics. Too much jeans and sneakers when I met her, lots of skirts and dresses and leather boots and heels when I moved out of the USA.<p>But I like a lot of other things that most men don't - I prefer taller women, and I prefer women who are built strong with good musculature, athletes, and girls with wider hips and shoulders. It always amazes me when I meet a girl who is an athlete and she's getting so much less attention from men than a girl who is on the alcohol + cigarettes + no food diet.<p>But I digress, quality is quality, and if you can find quality with less competition, that's absolutely worth going and getting. Going for a girl who is equal or lower quality but more highly chased doesn't make your life better, it's headache for (at best) ego-gratification, at worst a waste of time.",1264009346

Needing it every 2-4 months is also not implausible:  the individual changes (credit card expiration, email address, postal address, job title, etc) are infrequent, but when you stack them up they become relatively common.<p>Add in the fact that we provide a better interface than many of the services we are updating (e.g. PayPal and Yahoo, which disperse your information across multiple pages and show different versions of it in different places; e.g. some pages show title (Mr), some show suffix (Jr), some show middle name/initial, etc), and suddenly a modest fee starts to seem ok.<p>Our plan is to have a ""one day"" plan for very cheap--probably about $2--that is useful for a one-time use.

1065159,comment,1063485,1063485,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"Being Indian, this is a subject I think about a lot - I do mean a lot, almost as much as I think about our company (Zoho). I have also read a lot of literature on this subject - most recently the wonderful book Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics, by Yasheng Huang. I follow China closely because Deng Xiaoping China's track record of lifting people from poverty is unequaled and will likely never be equaled - given that only India has those kinds of numbers, and India hasn't done anywhere as well as China in lifting people from poverty.<p>It is worth looking at Deng Xiaoping's early rural reforms in China, to see an example that lifted the most people out of poverty in the shortest amount of time.<p>I can summarize it with the biblical saying: don't give a man fish, teach a man how to fish.<p>China's record illustrates a few things: a) a society where there is some order and stability, so people can <i>focus</i> on development. Way too many poor countries, including the poorest parts of India, have little or no stability on the ground. You have to be able to make a plan, and have a reasonable assurance that the overall environment around you is stable enough to execute the plan. This Deng provided.<p>b) Remove barriers to rural entrepreneurship, particularly light industry - shoes, textiles, everyday low tech household goods and the like. It should be possible for these ventures to be funded - they need fairly small amounts of capital, but the system has to be in place to provide access to that capital, and conversely, provide reasonable security to that capital. This is why order and stability matters - both sides on the capital equation have to be able to make a plan with some assurance.<p>c) Build roads in the countryside, so the rural entrepreneurs have market access, so they can get a higher price by selling to nearby urban areas (i.e they can get better terms of trade in exchange for other urban-made goods - this lifts both sides).<p>That is it. Note that I did not say anything about literacy, healthcare and so on. All of those things are important, but getting the first steps I listed above right would unleash a wave of human energy that would lift incomes on a massive scale. Even the poorest, most illiterate villages in India have a labor force that can produce these light goods <i>for their own consumption</i>, and have enough talent to organize that production - that is the crucial part to remember. They can lift consumption only if they lift production.<p>Step back and think about this: what is poverty? At its rawest level, it is a) not enough food b) not enough simple material goods. Unleashing rural entrepreneurship allows a) more food to be grown b) allows that same population to produce the simple material goods that vastly improve the human condition. I am not talking here about iPhones here, I am talking about the shirt on your back, shoes, toothbrush and the like. Once people take that first step on the ladder, they move up pretty fast.<p>Fortunately, where our company is (in India) and our current position (doing well) allows us to experiment. But there is that crucial first step, stability and order, we cannot provide, which means we can only go where there is stability and order, which obtains relatively more in Southern India than in the North, though (or should I say ""as a result"") Northern states are poorer.<p>Deng's China is the existence proof that it can be done.",1264007203

I am not sure though that I agree with him on the timing of the 'singularity issue'. I pretty much agree with him though, that we are at the dawn of a new era where computers and bioengineering will have a profound effect on humans.<p>There are many reasons as to why I am skeptical about the singularity - primarily stemming from my experience in programming. At present we do not have the engineering tools to do so - and nobody is really working hard on it. We are lacking efficient ways of generating software and most importantly the management skills to do so for <i>extreme</i>, extreme as extremely large software. Secondly to simulate the way the brain works we need to have a paradigm shift in how we <i>build</i> computers. It is also my contention that a large part of what we call <i>human intelligence</i> lies in language and NLP is a hard still unsolved problem.",1264007171

Here in America, people don't really care much where your parents came from or how you did in school, they measure success and class by what you have.  We haven't really discriminated on ""old-money""/""new-money"" lines in decades at least, and we've never had much in the way of titled lineages.  We don't have the centuries of cultural history of class immobility that Europeans have (I don't mean that judgmentally, I'm just saying we don't have that history in the back of our minds).",1264006820
