1064176,comment,1063485,1063708,0,0,dkarl,,,"You have to assume Cameroon has as many clever, ambitious sociopaths as any other country.  Why aren't they providing basic services?  The article explains why long-term investment doesn't take place, but it doesn't explain why simple for-profit services don't crop up in competition with the official ones.  For instance, if it costs too much to get a contract enforced legally, then there is a market for enforcing contracts illegally.  This is obviously bad news for the government officials profiting from the legal enforcement of contracts -- <i>unless</i> they are the ones running the illegal service, and they structure it as an inferior, low-end alternative to their legal service.  (Corrupt government officials have an advantage over the mafia:  corrupt government officials don't have to worry about getting shut down by the authorities.  They just have to share the loot with their superiors.)<p>The article also doesn't explain why government officials, even corrupt ones, fail to make cheap investments that pay off over a few years.  For instance, a kleptocrat should want a reliable supply of clean water to ensure that the farmers are healthy enough to plant and harvest crops, so he can steal the profits.  If an epidemic means the crops rot in the fields, that's money out of his pocket.  Money is readily converted to power, via bribes, weapons, or propaganda.  Losing money means losing power.  Why wouldn't a kleptocrat spend money on sanitation, especially if that means getting good marks from foreign governments and NGOs and qualifying for more aid?",1263966943
1064175,story,,,8,6,coffeemug,"Ask YC: [How] do you maintain a daily routine?",,"I usually waste a lot of my time on things that don't matter and as I'm getting older it's becoming a bigger priority for me to spend my time wisely. This year I resolved to get this part of my life under control. I think the best way to do it is to have a daily routine. When I tried to force a routine on myself, I realized there are three problems I need to solve:<p><pre><code>  - Sometimes I just don't want to do things in the scheduled order\n  - Sometimes other things take priority so I can't stick to schedule\n  - I cannot force myself to have a regular sleep schedule\n</code></pre>\nI solved the first two problems in the following way. I divide the day into four hour chunks. The rule is, I can rearrange the tasks within a chunk any way I want, but they must be done within the designated chunk. If something prevents me from doing a task, when I get back on schedule I can drop any of the items within the chunk I'm currently in, but not in any other chunks. This way I have enough flexibility to do the things I want (or can), but enough structure that I don't lose track of things.<p>But I can't solve the third problem. My natural sleep schedule is very irregular. If I go to sleep at a given time, I can't fall asleep, and can't wake up in the morning. If I sleep when I want, my schedule becomes very irregular (I end up going to sleep on different times every day, usually my sleep time shifting later and later into the night until I flip over). Every time I was forced to keep a sleeping schedule (for a full-time job), I have been very unproductive and miserable.<p>This has been the biggest stumbling block to implementing a daily routine. Does anyone have a similar problem? How do you solve it? All the standard remedies (exercise, etc.) don't help me go to sleep at a regular time, and I don't want to force myself to sleep via OTC medication. Perhaps I can work around it? Or force a schedule somehow? How do you do it?",1263966899

One could make investments in any other commodity whose value relative to other commodities stays constant or increases.<p>It is a somewhat unusual tax, in that your tax rate is based on what proportion of your assets are in dollars. Does someone know what the rate per year on dollar assets is and how to calculate it? You would need to know how much money the Fed prints in a year. Do they publish it or was that what auditing the fed was about?<p>Also for A), banks probably factor in inflation while setting the interest rate for a loan. So, the relevant variable, i guess, is unexpected inflation rather than the value of inflation itself. The debtor benefits only when the loan market makes low estimates.",1263964336

The ""real"" risk I guess is people using jets full of fuel as flying missiles.  However, post-9-11, no passengers will permit that use.  Hijacking planes is over.<p>So the scenario you describe: getting onto a rapidly moving tube of metal with a couple hundred people who haven't gone through metal detectors or x-ray machines is exactly what happens every time I take the train.  In fact, the lack of hour long security lines, having to remove my coat, belt, shoes, etc... is one of the reasons I strongly prefer the train.",1263963999

The fact is that hydrocarbon fuel is still the best, highest density energy transport we have. Batteries are still weak and, especially for flight, awfully heavy.<p>Keep the electric motors but ditch the batteries and replace it with a small gas turbine generator. For the same weight, you could probably increase the flight time by a factor of 10, well beyond the willingness of most people to sit in that thing ...",1263963981
