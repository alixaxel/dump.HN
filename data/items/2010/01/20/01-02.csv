(I'm not saying there isn't any, only that I don't know what it would be).<p>Note, though, that even people who want the government to do less aren't saying ""we'll do nothing"", they're saying ""we want to choose which things to do ourselves"".  No one needs a law or regulation to spend their own money, it's only required when you want someone else's money spent without having to convince them they should.",1263952632

Effective government is another part.  They are both effects of other causes.  And they themselves feed back.  It's not hard to point out the essentially gangster-like attributes of almost any government.  The USA seizes its citizens' property and kills people all across the world.  Oddly, since it steals so much more from a wealthier population, the theft isn't as painful.  It requires infrastructure to efficiently transfer taxes up and back down to government parasites, rather than have the parasites take it by hand, as in Cameroon.  So people rarely think of the USA as a gangster demanding protection money.<p>This guy is just another reductionist sociologist trying to come up with that one...one...one...reason why an extremely complicated situation is perpetually botched.",1263952624

It scans for rootkits, backdoors and possible local exploits. It does this by comparing SHA-1 hashes of important files with known good ones in online databases, searching for default directories (of rootkits), wrong permissions, hidden files and suspicious strings in kernel modules.<p>Maybe installing Jailkit to chroot SSH users might plug a hole for you too. This is a set of utilities to limit user accounts to specific files using chroot() and or specific commands. It is used to secure cvs, sftp, shell or daemon processes. You can give your users shell access without having to fear that they can see your whole system. Your users will be jailed in a specific directory which they will not be able to break out of.<p>As a future potential preventative, you might want to think about installing fail2ban. It is an intrusion prevention framework. It blocks selected IP addresses for hosts that are trying to breach the system's security by monitoring log files and will ban any host IP that makes too many login attempts or performs any other unwanted action within a time frame defined by the administrator.<p>These are for Linux, and I’m not an expert with them, so I can’t really walk you through installing or using them, but you might want to look into them and see if they might help you.<p>If this ""Security"" stuff is not your cup of tea, these guys might be able to help: \n<a href=""http://www.serverwizards.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.serverwizards.com/</a>\nI have never used them, but have come across a few of their happy ""Security"" customers in tech forums in the past.

While there's a cleanliness and purity to rigidly enforced templating I have never developed a web app where I didn't need some kind of creative ""UI"" logic somewhere.

1063771,comment,1063576,1063576,0,0,jcnnghm,,,"While reading Gladwell's book Outliers I got the distinct impression that you could effectively argue against his thesis, that successful people are only successful because of their circumstance, without changing many words in his book.  What Gladwell fails to understand is that what makes a person an outlier isn't that they happen to have expended energy getting good at something that people want, it's that they took the time and effort to get good at something to begin with.  What makes a person an outlier is the dedication and motivation to truly become an expert at something.<p>For example, in his book Gladwell says that Bill Gates is a victim of circumstance, and gives examples of that circumstance.  One example was that Gates frequently snuck out of his parent's house in the middle of the night to ride a public bus to a local college where he worked on an unused computer terminal.  Similarly, Gladwell tells a similar story about Steve Jobs, in which he looks up Bill Hewlett's number in the telephone book, and calls him to ask if he can have some spare electronic components to construct something for a school science project.  What makes those two outliers isn't that they had the opportunity to do those things, it's that they actually did them.  In both cases, they created an opportunity for themselves, then seized the opportunity.  They didn't just created one opportunity, however, they created and took advantage of hundreds of opportunities, each time further leveraging their cumulative advantage.  If it was truly just circumstance, then everyone living within bus distance to a college with an unused computer, and everyone with a telephone and a phone book should have founded Microsofts and Apples.",1263950782

It sounds like someone making $60k a year is simply not eligible for programs designed to help people making say $35k a year. Is that wrong? $60k/year is a pretty good amount of money. Opting out of a better job to avoid paying taxes on your increased income is a really bad career choice. All of the tax rates level out. So maybe $100k isn't a great spot to be in but you're not going to get to $150k by opting for the $60k/year job are you? This article just spews out entitlement.

The Wordnet database (<a href=""http://wordnet.princeton.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordnet.princeton.edu/</a>) actually has a wealth of synonymy and other word-word relations (probably significantly more extensive than Google's). In the future I can imagine that companies like Google with start to use things like syntactically related phenomena (e.g. syntactic ""synonymy"" between sentences like ""The dog bit John"" and ""John was bitten by the dog""), in place of the simple word-word relations, and probably eventually even tackle things like answering questions based on the semantic content of the query + websites. There's actually some interesting work done by Phil Resnik (<a href=""http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/</a>) here are UMD trying to do ""sentiment analysis"", whereby you essentially can detect spin/bias in a document by mapping grammatical structures to semantic features, and then analyzing that.
