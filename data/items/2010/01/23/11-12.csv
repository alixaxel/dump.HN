Vanishing RSI is trivial.<p>You're especially at risk because you've already sunk time and effort into retraining yourself, and have made a conscious decision to separate yourself from everybody else.  That's Big Magic, psychosomatically speaking.<p>None of this means you have to go back to QWERTY (or for that matter, that QWERTY is any less broken).  But if Dvorak's research really was shoddy and self-serving, and you want to take care of the hands you presumably use to earn a living, wouldn't it be a good idea at this point to look into other keyboard layouts with better-documented benefits?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment</a><p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html</a>",1264247456

1071698,comment,1071650,1071650,0,0,gexla,,,"I think email is still somewhat necessary.  First of all,  you aren't everyone, just because email isn't useful for you doesn't mean it's not useful for your users.  Second of all, most web apps require an email address to sign up, if for no other reason than to send a forgotten password reset.  So even all those kids who really don't have a use for email still have an email address to sign up for things like Facebook.  Speaking of Facebook, this service and others have a lot of resources to research these sorts of things, and they still use email as a signup.<p>As a user, I prefer when a service uses email for usernames.  One reason is that I can remember my email address, even if I don't use it.  Often I forget the usernames that I use to sign up for various services.  The other reason is that I know my email address is going to be unique, so that saves me from playing the ""username is already taken"" game.<p>I don't really have a problem with spam or known email users who are over active.  Gmail does a pretty damn good job of filtering the spam.  Custom filters do a good job of clearing things that aren't really spam but still annoying.",1264246856

For what? Under the Fair Facebook Vanity Names Act? There is no conceivable case Harman would have against FB for URLs on their own site!<p>FB might have a policy which would give companies priority. I think Twitter has been doing something similar when it reassigns celebrity names; in such cases the personal name of the original user is irrelevant as the decision is based upon what most people would expect from that name/what the company wants. Obviously, both Twitter and FB want to encourage companies and celebrities to endorse their service and offering them the names they want is a great way to get that endorsement.",1264246275
