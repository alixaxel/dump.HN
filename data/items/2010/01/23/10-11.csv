Even if you don't want to use the power features of pbxes, I still recommend connecting sipdroid to it instead of directly to sipgate or another provider, as pbxes has implemented a little trick that can save you a ton of battery life on your Android phone when connecting to it with sipdroid.

In my oppinion, Apple is in the position to lose market share on the mobile market (which analysts also predict) and has a reason to be afraid of. They have been the major (like 99%) player in this area for years and now fear to lose some ground, which is just natural.\nYou make a lot of assumptions and mix things up (google search vs. facebook, d'oh?) to tell your theory, but all in all, i wouldn't agree.\nAlso, afaik Schmidt left the board because of conflicting interests, which just seems natural for me. If you would be Apple, you wouldn't want to have such a competitor in your board, would you?\nBeforehand it was: Ok, Google brings good apps, ads, search, maps to our platform, thats great.
