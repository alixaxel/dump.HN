Besides, later arrivals will also be ""behind"" in the respect that they won't have had as much time to learn from mistakes.  In the <i>hyper-competitive</i> world of the web, it's actually pretty easy to use the first-mover advantage to the detriment of potential future competitors.<p>For example, a business like eBay has fees which are ludicrous, an interface that is not at all intuitive, but because it was pretty much the first established brand in online auctions, it's what most people keep using.",1262367800

Solve one, you get another one for free.<p>Once you have 'enough' FPU you have not enough memory bandwidth, so you go wider / faster on the memory bus (this is already happening, we are now well over 1GHz on the memory bus), or you place the memory closer to the CPU (also happening, increased cache size).<p>Then as soon as that is done you now no longer have 'enough FPU', so you go parallel.<p>GPUs now have almost 250 cores and yet there are plenty of people that use more than one in a single machine (I've seen up to 4 of those, with two dies each for almost 2000 cores). Clearly some people don't have 'enough FPU' yet, and plenty of games would want more effects to add to their engines (which seems to be the biggest driver of this kind of development outside of hard core number crunching).<p>Increased resolution displays are another driver for more FPU power because once you start shading every pixel becomes the end point of a long pipeline of mathematical operations.<p>I don't foresee anybody complaining of 'too much FPU' in the next decade or longer, in fact I suspect that once this kind of FPU capacity becomes mainstream that we'll see whole new breed of applications to take advantage of it.",1262366874

I think this new product must be great to use <i>alone</i> or will not meet the masses.<p>So even if this vision can be reductive I continue to think at this new product as a larger more powerful version of the iPhone that is mainly a portable device.<p>Portalbe does not mean the only usage is to carry it around outside your home. It feels natural that such a device is something you can lean on the table while cooking to read the news from internet, or to watch a film while on the bed after a destructive 2010 party like I'm doing right now.<p>Also of course in the ""outside"" world it's a great experience if the device is light enough.

So what I use is my iPhone indeed, but it's totally inadequate to perform tasks like writing a blog post.<p>So actually I can see why this device can be a success.<p>I also can clearly see (it's years I think that I could start a startup about this issue) how people are not able to share an image with one click, but this is, IMHO, an entirely different problem that should be addressed in some other way.<p>When I heard about Google Wave the first time my first reaction was: now people will be free to share things with one click in real-time, but my feelings with Wave are not good, it's not as ""simple"" as I dreamed, so I guess we have to wait for a new solution.",1262366825

Just a frank exchange of views.<p>I agree it would be nice to prevent Islamic Fundamentalist terrorism by understanding its causes, but that approach doesn't seem likely to work.  My opinion, as above, is that the thoughts of suicide murderers will be messy, hard to understand, specific to individuals, and not terribly useful for preventing terrorism.  This is because people are complicated, and because, legally and practically, suicide bombers are <i>crazy</i>.  They're a threat to themselves and others.<p>I don't think there's any coherent argument against trying to understand the psychology of terrorism, but I find the enthusiasm for that course of action slightly ominous.  This is an armchair discussion for me, and I suspect most people here, so the line between ""Trying to Understand"" and just wishing the problem would go away without our doing anything about it looks pretty thin.<p>That mindset has to be fought, in spite of the stupid posturing and overreaction after 9/11, because it's possible to overcompensate.  If a bunch of murderous lunatics jump onto the world stage by killing a few thousand people and then claim they're the Next Great Existential Threat to the USA, it's not right to ignore them because they don't live up their own hype.",1262366790
