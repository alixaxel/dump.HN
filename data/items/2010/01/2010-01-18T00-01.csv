1059206,comment,1059188,1059188,0,0,waleedka,,,"Background story: this game was built for the Amiga by my friend, Rabah, when we were in college in Iraq. He brought together a team of a graphics designer and a music composer and they built an amazing product, but they couldn't sell it due to the economic sanctions on Iraq at the time. Then the Amiga just died after that and the game basically went no where. It was a sad story of a dream that didn't materialize. But now after all these years, Rabah brought the team back together along with new members to port it to the iPhone.

1059198,comment,1058810,1059054,0,0,haberman,,,"> The problem with removing the GIL seems to be garbage collection.<p>I'm not sure this is the real problem; after all, reference counts can be atomically incremented and decremented.<p>The real problem is that primitive operations in Python (like ""foo.bar"") cannot safely be performed in C without locking, because you need the hash table to remain consistent while you are doing lookups and/or insertions.  This forces you to either wrap all such operations in locks (which has been tried, and slows down the single-threaded case by something like 2x) or reimplement them with lock-free data structures.  The latter could be an interesting experiment; you could probably implement a tree-based map using RCU.",1263775479

In general, I don't support government censorship, and especially not prior restraint of mass media (such as exists in China today). But I also have trouble characterizing what happened in the case discussed in this thread as ""government censorship,"" inasmuch as the site is still posted for all the world to view (and for much of the world to become more interested in, as a result of this controversy). As another reply in this thread points out, Google's response seems to be standard operating procedure for Google much like what Google does in many other countries around the world. I am not an Australian resident, much less an Australian citizen, so I will defer to the constituents of the constitutional commonwealth that is Australia to decide whether the current policy in Australia is a good idea or not. But I don't think Google is deserving of particular criticism here, and I think the blog that publicized this story might have devoted more time to how Google is spammed up by quacks on medical issues or constrained by dictatorial governments like the government of China.",1263774966

But I learned that attempting to do so would immediately cause PayPal to freeze the account and demand paperwork that we are authorized to accept payments on behalf of a 501C (which we aren't).<p>Instead, I'm thinking that it would be nice if there were certain non-profit organizations (or an authorized third-party site that collects money on their behalf) in which I redirect a user to the donation URL, and the site sends me a notification when the user has successfully donated (via a POST to a URL of my choice), allowing me to confirm and process the reward.
