1089056,comment,1089005,1089005,0,0,grellas,,,"This a very insightful piece, as I learned from experience when I began a while back to add useful content for startups to my firm's website. We are a smaller, boutique firm but have been doing startups for a long time in Silicon Valley. The giving away of ""a little bit of your brain power"" (as the author puts it) has done nothing but pay dividends.<p>The only quibble I would have is with the author's emphasis on this being an ideal way for young, unestablished lawyers to make a mark. This is a field in which much is gained by experience, and the expertise to be shared by a brand new or relatively inexperienced lawyer in this field is likely to be somewhat abstract and academic (e.g., what are stock options?) versus strategic and practical (e.g., what are optimum uses of stock options for startups in different stages?). Founders get sleepy-eyed reading abstract discussions of law but are very alert to practical discussions affecting their vital interests (e.g., on this site, I once posted a simple piece on ""what it means to own x% of a company"" and got thousands of visitors to my site).<p>For lawyers with some years of big firm experience, though, this is an excellent way to promote any new practices they might establish.<p>It would also be great if large firms used this method as well but the key to it all is being open and approachable and such firms tend to be somewhat closed. Maybe they will open up with time and a changing environment. Moreover, it is perceived to be inherently risky to ""give away"" your valuable techniques as a law firm and lawyers acting in large groups (such as are found in the large-firm partnerships), being cautious by nature, tend to set up lots of obstacles for any individual lawyer in the firm trying to share expertise in this way - in essence, everything goes through committees, which usually stifle such attempts.<p>In any event, this piece offers prescient insights about this subject.",1264877400

This means you either have to aim for tourists or provide a paparazzi-free haven to celebrities.<p>Fishing would be mandatory for food and greenhouses would certainly be required, and preferably a well implemented vertical farming operation could do wonders. However, unless the scale is huge it would be difficult to become self-sufficient, especially if providing meat via cattle/pigs. Chickens are relatively easy to keep in higher densities and would likely provide a good supply of protein, providing you have the room to have the graze; incidentally, chickens are only generally destructive of grasses around their nest-site (where the chicken coop is) and are excellent pest controls. Without natural predators and with clipped wings, chickens could be allowed to forage in any open gardens. You'd be required to introduce worms, certain bugs and beetles, and bees anyway, so they'd provide supplementary nutrition to your chickens (free of cost and the chickens are a form of organic pesticide).<p>The economy would likely have to have a vertically integrated economy. Basically, you either need to seduce a whale (rich person/celebrity/etc) who'll spend money on services you're providing for a few benefits (major privacy), or you'll have to net tourists and take their money, or you'll have to have a huge export industry, likely through fishing. If you're choosing the latter, you might as well buy out or establish a fishing platform and work from there. It's been well established that oceanic platforms can act as their own man-made reef, encouraging fish growth in their area. Essentially, a well designed platform could be a self-fulfilling prophecy.",1264876821
