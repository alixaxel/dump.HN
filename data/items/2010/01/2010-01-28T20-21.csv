I phrased it poorly, my apologies.<p>Abstracting away the hierarchical file system is a positive for my mom, who can never find stuff she's saved, but I have no issues using one in the first place, so my gains are smaller.  She'll be thrilled not to have to navigate an application installer or download some component from the web to run something, but doing that is nearly effortless for me.<p>It's no loss at all to my Mom that the iPad can't run some GPL Ruby VOIP app she wrote herself, because she can't write a Ruby VOIP app.  By contrast, I would be giving up my ability to write and run my own Ruby VOIP app[1].<p>Overall, I (as a very tech literate person) benefit less from the positives and feel the pinch of the negatives more than my mom (or any less tech literate person).  It could still be a good trade for me, but I wind up looking at a totally different values proposition than my mother would.<p>[1] - I have no interest in writing a VOIP app.",1264712380

If you are a consultant with no clients, then sure you don't need a business, but good to have one set up before you get clients.<p>Sometimes having a business is as simple as a DBA... cheap to do and a couple hours, looks more professional to have a client pay a company than cutting a check to Joe Smoe.<p>In my opinion, any time you are entering into a contract with a third party, it is best to have a legal entity set up.  Talk to any company whose been around a while, consultancy or product company, and you'll hear war stories about deals gone bad.

If anything the iPad might decrease pre-flight movie sales, because the TSA would think it's witchcraft--i mean, a bomb.<p>I see the iPad as more of a home-mobile device, rather than a mobile device. That is, it's a device mainly for home use which allows you to be mobile around the house with your information, instead of a device you take outside.

Using libraries is important and something that should be covered in an introduction to a language.<p>My point about operator precedence is that it is clearer because it is explicit. When you add exponentiation into infix math notation, it gets very easy to screw stuff up by missing a paren. 
x<i>x+y</i>y is ambiguous with x<i>(x+y)</i>y, in lisp it would be (+ (* x x) (* y y)) vs. (* x y (+ x y)).

Ive sold cell phones since 2002 and here is the deal:<p>Basically non t-mobile, verizon or whatever stores are independent stores. They buy a phone, say for $500. Then a contract gives them a spiff for it, say $250. So the store charges you $300 for the phone and makes $50 off the sale. IF you terminate the contract with t-mobile or any of these companies before your contract is up AT ANY TIME, that $250 is not paid to the store, or is deducted from what the carrier owes the store. Basically the store (like google) MUST charge you $250 or they lose more money than they made off of your sale.<p>This is why the little cellphone stores make you sign similar agreements. Now how the company recoups the ""price of the phone"" by early termination fee, I don't know. The fee is pure profit for the carrier.",1264709880

Where were all these people when Sony brought out the PS3? or when Microsoft brought out the Xbox? How about the Wii? DS? PSP? Amazon Kindle? Nook? All of these are <i>specialized</i> computing devices. All of them are officially ""closed"" (though a great many are hackable). The fact that those systems are closed dosen't threaten mainstream general purpose computers. Why should the iPad? It's a device built for a specific purpose: consuming entertainment and media content as well as some work-related tasks like email and word processing.",1264708817

It was unique among books I've read in that I put it down at the end and thought ""Wow, that was something... but I'm not sure what.""",1264708802
