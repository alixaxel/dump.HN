I continued to keep them up to date on it, hoping that they'd even call me up on it so that we could figure something out.

We used the tortoise interface and after a few weeks everyone got used to it.<p>Adding plugins for specific apps is a good idea. I had previously used Alienbrain and the only real difference was the plugins (AB had plugins for MS Office, 3DSMax, Dev Studio and Maya) and an interesting bucket backup system where you could back up legacy checkings making the database smaller and significantly faster. At the time we had a database of about 1TB and most of it was in bucket backups.<p>Another interesting feature was the workflow where an artist would checkin an item but it wouldn't go into the main development branch until a senior artist has checked the work. This was a nice idea but proved to be too time expensive for our senior artists who of course were not paid to be gatekeepers and were the best artist we had so management preferred them to actually make things!<p>The least interesting thing was the price per seat which was around £1000 per year and a support contract which grew depending on the size of your team (this was about 8 years ago so I may be off on the prices then and now).<p>Although Alienbrain was cool my personal feeling was that the money was better spent on a little bit of training and a subversion system.

In this particular market, this cannot happen because each product is unique and gives monopoly to its owner.<p><i>But this is not written in stone.</i><p>Imagine an alternate model where artists still own full IP rights, including on non-commercial use, but use an open process to distribute their music. A free for all in distribution.<p>Or a model in which artists only make money in commercial distribution. Pirate Bay would have to pay, but downloaders not.<p>Or any model in which the artists can be compensated in two different ways. For example the classic way, and a way for listeners to subscribe to ""unlimited mp3"" plans. Of course, if both distribution channels go trough the same media companies, like I think they do now with online music purchases, there is no real competition to drive the prices down.<p>The crux of the matter is that the bottleneck is not at the artists, but one step down. Remove that, and lots of alternate models involving real competition can appear.",1264425243

1074992,comment,1074285,1074285,0,0,alextgordon,,,"There are many different motives for piracy. Some are morally justifiable (at least to me), some are not. For example:<p>* Lack of available funds. This is a mostly harmless (and sometimes beneficial) form of piracy. If a person has $75 and a product costs $200, then their two options are non-purchase and piracy. In this case, piracy cannot financially hurt the owner, as the person could not have bought the product in the first place.<p>Adobe have used this kind of piracy to their considerable advantage. High school and college kids pirate Photoshop and become proficient. They go on to become professionals, already locked into Photoshop.<p>* Unwillingness (but not inability) to purchase. This is a harmful type of piracy. A person has the available funds, but pirates something through pure unwillingness to pay for it. This is seen mostly in music and app store piracy.<p>This is a difficult kind of piracy to deal with. How do you compete with something that is free? One notable success is Spotify, which has displaced a proportion of piracy by merely being more convenient.<p>* Non-availability. This is particularly prevalent in the piracy of TV shows. Frequently a program is shown exclusively in the US, and is not available in other countries for months or years, sometimes never at all.<p>This is potentially financially harmful to rights owner, but as those pirating the shows only have the options of non-purchase and piracy, it is justifiable.<p>* Superiority of the pirated product. For example, music at a higher bitrate than can be easily purchased, a pirated TV show that can be watched at any time in full 1080p, a pirated game that does not include restrictive DRM. This type of piracy is financially harmful.<p>Morally this is a bit of a gray area. Perhaps the moral solution is to purchase the inferior product and pirate the superior one. This is however still illegal. The general solution is for the rights owners to ""compete"" with pirates, to provide equal products.",1264425193

It would go wrong if one cell is triggered twice in a row without the other cell being triggered in the meantime.<p>So I think I didn't understand the goal. So the goal is to have the system still behave correctly with any sequence op c.update() calls? E.g. if I choose do do cells[(0,0)].update() 10 times in a row it should still work.<p>Here's the updated version: <a href=""http://pastebin.com/f72c576d3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/f72c576d3</a><p>This fix took 5 minutes. I actually used a gen counter and self.state[self.gen%2] before, so changing that to %3 wasn't much work :)<p>The other change was:<p><pre><code>    if any(cells[n].gen < self.gen for n in neighbors if n in cells):\n      return\n</code></pre>\nAnd I removed the code do delete empty cells. I thought about removing empty cells and obviously you can remove them in some cases. But in general it's undecidable I think because life is turing complete and you don't know if some group of cells is going to shoot a glider to another group, so to be safe you have to keep them in sync.<p>Is this version correct now? I'm not sure...it seems to execute the examples correctly but maybe it will go wrong if you call update in just the right pattern.<p>BTW does the code run on your computer?",1264424556
