This is certainly the best iPad article I've read so far.

1085723,comment,1085395,1085708,0,0,riffer,,,"Thanks for the feedback.  You know, I have somewhat mixed feelings about The Shared Front Page.  For a small, cozy community there's no question it's the right way to go.  And for a larger site, using things like hide functionality as a band-aid is a mistake as well.  At the same time, there is a ton of exceptional content out there that we know we miss in the current state, so there's definitely room for an effective technical solution.  In terms of this particular tool, I think you put your finger on it when you pointed out that applying this to the HN frontpage is a bit of a mis-application.  Filtering 30 stories that most users have at least glanced at the title for, and hence have some familiarity with, down to 8 is not particularly interesting in and of itself.<p>The title of the article links to the discussion, and the URL links to the submission link.  Without the underlining, that isn't as clear as it might be.  The idea of the upvote arrows is clever, but then that might invoke ""The Fury"" aka The Ban and/or The Email.",1264735002
