When a ""glastnost"" comes to China, as it did Russia, if they're clever about marketing, using Google could ultimately be a symbol of new found freedoms.  The fact that the Chinese government has made it difficult for them to operate, given competitors an operational advantage and enabled hackers that attack them and other firms, must make it an easier risk to take.<p>Being the idealist I am, I want to believe, and I think there's a good probability that doing the right thing here, will mean greater profits now <i>and</i> in the future.",1263340005

It has a <i>great</i> C API, and it's not hard to write wrappers for C libraries as necessary.<p>While Lua standalone is a decent language (almost a Python/Scheme hybrid), Lua + C is quite powerful.

1048799,comment,1047495,1047824,0,0,bonsaitree,,,"IME, extremely well, but see my previous comment on the general professionalism of Virginia police.  I've had no personal experience with potentially litigious/confrontational law enforcement encounters outside of VA.<p>By immediately asserting your rights, the officer in question knows that they are not dealing with a person of ""legal ignorance"".  As with communication in all social interactions, an assertive (but not aggressive) carriage, posture, positive eye contact, and tone helps a great deal.<p>Keep in mind that, in most contexts, when I see the triplet of a badge, an open-carry gun (the gun is key), and a police uniform, my default assumption is that of a PERSON who's sworn an oath and, consciously or unconsciously, respects SOME sort of legal authority given their avocation (though it may not necessarily be true).<p>FWIW, if you have any doubt, it's worth asking CLEARLY if the presumed officer in question has ""sworn arrest powers in <insert municipality>"".  Police are allowed to lie, but they're not legally allowed to ""assert police powers"" such as arrest and/or detainment unless they have truly have them.  In most U.S. state codes, there's a clear delineation between what constitutes a ""lawful"" and an ""unlawful order"" by law enforcement.  Asserting police powers without being a sworn law enforcement officer is also usually a felony.<p>At worst, you may be severely inconvenienced for an ""officer's safety"" by being handcuffed and/or temporarily detained on-site, but you've preserved all of your rights under the law.  Fighting temporary detainment is a ""sticky wicket"" and generally ill-advised unless you genuinely feel that your life or the lives of your family are at immediate risk (e.g. driving your pregnant wife to the hospital, etc.).",1263337451
