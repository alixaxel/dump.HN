If this were Chinese style, any site which argued that the DMCA is flawed or should be repealed/reformed would get a blanket disappearing imposed by the government.<p>But since it's not Chinese-style you can talk about the DMCA all you want -- the only things that disappear from search results are specific URLs which are claimed to violate the law itself, removed not after a wide-ranging government demand but after a narrowly-targeted civil-law complaint (and there's a counter-filing system which allows maintainers of those URLs to respond and have due process -- I doubt very much that China allows such challenges to its censorship).",1263782708

This is a pretty clear temperature link.<p>---<p>Perhaps the most relevant limits of which I speak are regarding the extent to which we are willing to change our world. This is a separate question from the action of CO2 -- for example we already fix more nitrogen as all other life on this planet, and three quarters of the land based biomes on this planet have been dramatically influenced by our actions. <i>We have changed this planet.</i> Are we to become conscious of this or are we to continue claiming innocence and practicing ignorance as we accelerate our ecological impact?<p>A return to the atmospheric conditions of the Triassic might well be the best thing for the world, but as long as people continued to be confused, lazy and stupid about what kind of future we want, we will continue to argue about tiny details having little to nothing to do with the global atmospheric, ecological, biological climatic change that is taking place, and we will continue to be at odds as our actions annihilate biomes that we scarcely know about.<p>I put the question back to you. What change in the world would be acceptable to you? If we have reconcilable goals for our shared planet, then at least the debate becomes on of science, of planning, of what must be done. If, however, like many seem to think, you too believe that the changes we are making to the world are ultimately inconsequential, the loss of biodiversity acceptable, and our gambling with the ecosystem immaterial, then we are at odds that this conversation will not mend.",1263782350

In this particular case censorship was a force for good.<p>As an aside, Google was running 'used aborigines' adverts from ebay for quite a while.  Do you think these adverts should also be allowed to run?<p>Australian society mostly takes a very dim view of racism, and especially racism towards the aborigines.  Our elected representatives and the people of australia put in place laws such that this type of thing does not happen.<p>However the government and politicians did not make this particular case of censorship happen - the courts of law made it happen.  I think most of society agree that it is a shit thing that google was doing in this instance.<p>Google has in place limits to stop things like pornography showing up, with it's safe search feature.  This is already a form of censorship based on the values of countries like the USA.<p>Where do we draw the line?  Obviously sociopaths shouldn't be able to say whatever they like to millions of people if their words will cause harm.  How about spammers bent on selling their products?  Google already blocks some of the spammers.  As do they block malware serving sites, and sites that don't play by googles rules of what constitutes a good web page.  Make a website more google friendly, and google will reward you with higher rankings.  Put more google messages (adverts) on your pages, and get more people to see them, and google will pay you more money.  How about companies abusing trademarks or abusing copyright?  Are those censorship too?<p>Do we take the values of a multi national corporations(ie google)?  Isn't that a form of cultural imperialism?  What is to stop the courts abusing their power?

What is to stop google from abusing their power and imposing their views on people who do not want them?   ... glibly, I guess the answer to that is adblock.<p>I don't think you can have a 'censorship is always wrong' approach, or a 'totally abusing censorship in terrible ways' approach either.

When I asked the profs why, the general answer was 'takes too much time'.<p>(I 'spect part of it is that history is a 'humanity' ... but also that it's because they didn't get the history either, and didn't have time to learn it well enough to teach it.)<p>The physics department (major US university) actually hired a history of science scholar, and I heard grumbling that he should be paid for by another department.",1263780411

Actually, even having a printer or sending a fax (especially in English) required certain process and security clearance. So the answer is no, we were isolated. The game was sitting on my floppy drive and then on all the hard drives of all the computers I owned. Actually, even the graphics artist did not have a copy and did not have the chance to play the game. We were doing all the development on one Amiga 500 machine (500kb, no HD and connected to a TV) at my house. To add do that, it was even difficult to communicate with game publishers and send them a demo of the game. Even when we were successful in sending the demo, the feedback we receive was often negative because they can not deal with Iraq due to the economic sanctions.",1263780350

However, congress is currently working to adopt a federal shield law, which apparently will define a journalist as such:<p><i>(iii) obtains the information sought while working as a salaried employee of, or independent contractor for, an entity—
(I) that disseminates information by print, broadcast, cable, satellite, mechanical, photographic, electronic, or other means; and
(II) that—
(aa) publishes a newspaper, book, magazine, or other periodical;
(bb) operates a radio or television broadcast station, network, cable system, or satellite carrier, or a channel or programming service for any such station, network, system, or carrier;
(cc) operates a programming service; or
(dd) operates a news agency or wire service;</i><p>So by this law, amateur journalists do not count, which is truly unfortunate. Of course, that doesn't exclude amatuer journalists from observing and reporting, it merely excludes them from lawfully being able to not reveal their sources in a court of law.<p>Read more on this topic here:

The one set up with the button has priority over the global one specified per Paypal account.  Thus, if you know the email address associated with e.g. the Red Cross' Paypal account, you can craft Paypal URLs which cause people to go to Paypal, send money directly to the Red Cross, and then come back to a page under your control.
