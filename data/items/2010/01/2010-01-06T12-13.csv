They seem to wander all over the place, full of buzzwords and much of what he claims doesn't seem to have any connection to what he actually did.<p>Huffman encoding?  Then why are <i>so many</i> of the defaults wrong?  Nearly any perl programmer would tell you that your programs should start with ""use strict"", so wouldn't Huffman encoding dictate that ""strict"" would need to be turned <i>off</i> if you <i>didn't</i> want it?  And choosing ""special return value"" to signal failure can't possibly be shorter than using exceptions, it can only be <i>as good</i> if you don't handle any errors.<p>He's always reminded me of someone trying to be ""deep"" after smoking a joint.",1262782625
1034635,comment,1034551,1034551,0,0,gjm11,,,"It took me a little while to work out what he's doing here, so here are a few notes for interested readers.<p>0. Key point: the goal here is to do infinite-precision integrals. Not merely ""arbitrary precision"", where you get to choose a number of decimal places and then do the integral, but ""infinite precision"", where the result of the integration is an object you can get arbitrarily many decimal places out of.<p>1. His key data structure is a ""lazy number"" (not his term) that represents some specific exact real number, and which you can query somehow (he doesn't really say how) to get an arbitrarily good approximation to its value. For instance, you might be able to say ""give me an interval of length at most x that the number is guaranteed to lie within"".<p>2. So he does everything with interval arithmetic. In particular, you need to have a way to do an interval evaluation of the function you're trying to integrate. That is, given an interval [a,b] you can get values lo,hi such that lo <= f(x) <= hi whenever a <= x <= b, and if you let these intervals shrink to a point your lower and upper bounds converge on the value of f at that point. (Note: he never states that last point, but it's important.) Let's call these lb(f,a,b) and ub(f,a,b) for ""lower bound"" and ""upper bound"".<p>3. Clearly the following two things are true. (a) The integral of f between a and b -- call this I(f,a,b) -- lies between (b-a).lb(f,a,b) and (b-a).ub(f,a,b). (b) I(f,a,b) = I(f,a,m) + I(f,m,b) where m = (a+b)/2. (Or indeed where m = anything else.)<p>4. (3a) gives us a crude way to evaluate I(a,b) roughly. Typically it's very crude, but it's guaranteed correct and as a,b get closer together it converges on the right answer. (3b) gives us a way to evalute I(f,a,b) more accurately, by using integrals over shorter intervals.<p>5. So, he defines I(f,a,b) = (3a) intersect (3b), where that's a lazy intersection on ""lazy numbers"". The idea is that when you query it, it uses (3a) if that's enough to get the accuracy you need, and otherwise it uses (3b) to do better.<p>6. There are a whole lot of details being swept under the rug here. For instance, when you take the (3b) branch, how much accuracy do you need from the two subproblems to get the requested accuracy for the final result? (This question is relevant only if the unspecified functionality provided by his lazy numbers really is ""give me an interval of length at most L containing the correct value"". If instead what you get is ""tell me whether the correct value is above or below X"", there's a different problem, which is that if X happens to <i>be</i> the correct value then the computation will continue for ever until you run out of memory or terminate it.) One possible answer is that you demand twice as accurate a result from each sub-computation. I think that in this case the algorithm will in general not actually terminate, but I haven't thought it through carefully.<p>7. So the whole thing is a bit like the following (with apologies for absence of formatting):<p>integral(f,a,b,tolerance) = let lb,ub = bounds(f,a,b) in {if abs(b-a)abs(ub-lb) <= tolerance then (b-a)[lb,ub] else let m = (a+b)/2 in integral(f,a,m,tolerance/2) + integral(f,m,b,tolerance/2)}<p>except that (a) it uses lazy evaluation to make it so that you call integral(f,a,b) and then repeatedly feed tolerance values to that, (b) because of this it's presumably able to do less redundant recomputation when you do the calculation repeatedly with different tolerances, and (c) the actual way in which the tolerances are handled may be different.",1262782605

Most apps don't need to be as fast as possible, but only fast enough.  Adding a bunch of stuff that slows down python will decrease the set of problems where python is fast enough and thus usable.  A large app I recently worked on is a python app interacting with a bunch of C++ libraries.  The faster I could make my python code the more I can move stuff from C++ to python, which greatly decreases the time it takes to develop and change the app.",1262781679

However, a week ago, it was a full moon, so at midnight the Moon would be at it highest point in the sky, and I think North America would have been swung a lot closer towards the elliptical plane, because of the Earth’s tilt, so the full Moon would appear higher in the sky than the Sun does at noon. Finally, at what point in the Moon's cycle this month, would it's highest elevation in the sky be at the same elevation as the Sun at noon?<p>I'm looking for a good book that will explain all these things with an Earth-centered approach, and teach me the correct terms, like the ones satellite technicians need to know.<p>Thanks!",1262781158
