You are essentially suggesting that you wish to become one.<p>What you are about to do is to layer one IPSP on top of another so you control the stream of funds. Because you outsource the bulk of the problems to the IPSP below you you will have a relatively easy time of it.<p>If your merchants are going to use your platform (it is hard to say exactly what you will run in to without knowing a whole lot more about your project, but I understand you do not want to put all your cards on the table) then you will want to keep the balance you hold for them as low as possible to reduce the risk in case something goes wrong.<p>I'm actually working on a very long post (more like a small book) regarding the whole internet payment process, likely it will too much time for you to wait until it is done.<p>Ideally you would make a deal with an IPSP to see you as an affiliate, and get every merchant their own account with the IPSP. That way your exposure is limited and in case of conflict it will be between the merchants and the IPSP you pick.<p>Some, but not all IPSPs support this kind of functionality, the 'split' is usually either a fixed amount per transaction or a %age of the total sales volume.<p>You will have to figure in a two to six week 'holdback' period which is used to create a reserve in case of massive chargebacks due to fraud, it is also a major source of income for IPSPs and a major source of trouble in case one goes under.",1263365382
1049617,comment,1048800,1049610,0,0,nikils,,,"A new approach to China<p>1/12/2010 03:00:00 PM<p>Like many other well-known organizations, we face cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. In mid-December, we detected a highly sophisticated and targeted attack on our corporate infrastructure originating from China that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google. However, it soon became clear that what at first appeared to be solely a security incident--albeit a significant one--was something quite different.<p>First, this attack was not just on Google. As part of our investigation we have discovered that at least twenty other large companies from a wide range of businesses--including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors--have been similarly targeted. We are currently in the process of notifying those companies, and we are also working with the relevant U.S. authorities.<p>Second, we have evidence to suggest that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. Based on our investigation to date we believe their attack did not achieve that objective. Only two Gmail accounts appear to have been accessed, and that activity was limited to account information (such as the date the account was created) and subject line, rather than the content of emails themselves.<p>Third, as part of this investigation but independent of the attack on Google, we have discovered that the accounts of dozens of U.S.-, China- and Europe-based Gmail users who are advocates of human rights in China appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties. These accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users' computers.<p>We have already used information gained from this attack to make infrastructure and architectural improvements that enhance security for Google and for our users. In terms of individual users, we would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords online. You can read more here about our cyber-security recommendations. People wanting to learn more about these kinds of attacks can read this U.S. government report (PDF), Nart Villeneuve's blog and this presentation on the GhostNet spying incident.<p>We have taken the unusual step of sharing information about these attacks with a broad audience not just because of the security and human rights implications of what we have unearthed, but also because this information goes to the heart of a much bigger global debate about freedom of speech. In the last two decades, China's economic reform programs and its citizens' entrepreneurial flair have lifted hundreds of millions of Chinese people out of poverty. Indeed, this great nation is at the heart of much economic progress and development in the world today.<p>We launched Google.cn in January 2006 in the belief that the benefits of increased access to information for people in China and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results. At the time we made clear that ""we will carefully monitor conditions in China, including new laws and other restrictions on our services. If we determine that we are unable to achieve the objectives outlined we will not hesitate to reconsider our approach to China.""<p>These attacks and the surveillance they have uncovered--combined with the attempts over the past year to further limit free speech on the web--have led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China. We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.<p>The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequences. We want to make clear that this move was driven by our executives in the United States, without the knowledge or involvement of our employees in China who have worked incredibly hard to make Google.cn the success it is today. We are committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.<p>Posted by David Drummond, SVP, Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer",1263365324

I live in China, therefore can't read the blog post (though have deduced much of its content from reading these comments!)<p>Before the Olympics, the Firewall would periodically block blogspot, but it was easy to get around it using proxies. However, post-Olympics, in May 2009, all of blogspot was blocked (not just those dealing with F<i>l</i>n G*ng, etc), including through proxies, newsfeeds, everything. Every few weeks, new sites are blocked. It seems the Olympics was a minor P.R. obstacle to the unrestricted censorship they really wanted; once over, the censors have gone into free fall.<p>The blockages seems arbitrary. One can almost understand a line of logic whereby all blogspot blogs are blocked, e.g. ""The users are anonymous, their details not verifiable by our government officials..."" blah blah. But how can you explain blocking <a href=""http://www.python.org/download/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/download/</a> and subpages, blocked here for the last 3 to 6 months?

Now they are saying, 'our presence is being abused by the gov't.  We are now a negative factor'.<p>I'm sure they aren't giddy about getting hacked, but if not getting hacked was their primary goal, I doubt complete withdraw from China would be move #1",1263363088

First, Baidu has managed to win Beijing's favor, a trump card in this command economy. The government controls the Internet and appreciates loyal partners. Baidu understands that it operates under the good graces of the Chinese Communist Party, and continues to show it. As Robin Li, the company's chief executive, said in an interview with the Guardian, ""As a locally operated company we need to obey the Chinese law. If the law determines that certain information is illegal, we need to remove it from our index.""<p><a href=""http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/09/29/where_google_loses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/09/29/where_googl...</a><p>> Privacy and Security. Google is committed to protecting consumer privacy and confidentiality. Prior to the launch of Google.cn, Google conducted intensive reviews of each of our services to assess the implications of offering it directly in China. We are always conscious of the fact that data may be subject to the jurisdiction of the country where it is physically stored. With that in mind, we concluded that, at least initially, only a handful of search engine services would be hosted in China.<p>We will not store data somewhere unless we are confident that we can meet our expectations for the privacy and security of users’ sensitive information.

The specific thing to look for is what it takes to become PCI certified. You will need to hook up with a gateway (such as FirstData or PaySquare) to get your charges processed.<p>Imho you are on the wrong path and would do better to simply apply to an existing IPSP as a customer and get a merchant account. That way you sidestep all the things that have to do with certification, you only need to pass the merchant accreditation, which is a whole lot easier and less costly.<p>Examples of IPSPs that you could apply to are epoch, ccbill and vxsbill.<p>Good Luck.",1263362491

But to the best of my knowledge, all cancers have distinctive cancer cell surface chemistry - which may vary somewhat between individual genotypes, but is generally similar for clades of cancers between individuals. In the targeted paradigm, cancer research is a matter of identifying that chemistry, and then programming your hunter-killers to that scent.<p>These two jobs - (a) take an individual's cancer biopsy and identify its signature, or match it to an established library of signatures and (b) construct a homing mechanism for that signature - are core competencies for today's cutting edge biotechnology.<p>There are many, many examples from the past few years of researchers doing exactly what you scoff at in the laboratory, for specific cancers in laboratory animals.<p>In summary: one technology platform, many different implementations, a large library of cancer signatures built from the results of individual therapies.",1263362469
