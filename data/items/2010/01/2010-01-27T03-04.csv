It's intended to be an ""aerotropolis"" using Incheon airport to plug it into Asia's trade routes.<p>They're taking advantage of the fact that it's new build to make it dense, energy efficient, and very, very heavily wired and networked as well, and the article mentions Cisco an irritating amount as the lead partner on utilities and services.<p>What I found most interesting was the idea that they're using the experience they've gained so far to do the same thing elsewhere, faster. The idea of building a 300k city in under a decade on 1,500 acres (6 km²) blows my mind, and if this can be done (and it can) it makes Charter Cities suddenly more believable.",1264564792

1079669,comment,1078652,1079342,0,0,vitaminj,,,"I think there are various levels of ""badness"" when it comes to theft:<p>1) When you steal your neighbour's car, that's the worst because you're completely depriving your neighbour of the exclusive use and enjoyment of their property.<p>2) When you copy a digital product that your neighbour has created, and then sell it for profit without paying royalties, then that's pretty bad, but less bad than 1). Your neighbour can still sell / use their works but you have deprived him/her of exclusivity in selling their works.<p>3) When you copy your neighbour's digital product for your own enjoyment, then you are depriving your neighbour of a potential sale. Still bad, but less bad than 1) and 2). It's only when everyone does it and your neighbour loses all their potential sales does it become as bad as 1), i.e. tragedy of the commons.<p>I'm not at all suggesting that reproducible digital products are public goods, but they share some similar characteristics in the context of piracy that I think are interesting, namely non-rivalness and non-excludability. And as mentioned before, a tragedy of the commons scenario occurs when everyone (or lots of people) engage in piracy, just like what happens when all fishermen over-fish a lake.<p>This obviously suggests that some kind of regulation is needed, which I suppose is the point of copyright laws. But what I'd like to know are the economic effects of piracy, for example:<p>What is the ""piracy elasticity of demand""? In other words, how does demand for a product change as piracy levels change? Obviously as piracy levels approach 100%, the demand would be near zero, but what are the changes between 0 to 100%. Of interest is if there are any ""sweet spot"" levels of piracy where demand actually goes up.<p>I suspect there's a possibility that at low levels of piracy, the positive effects from things such as word-of-mouth marketing, early adoption / user familiarity (particularly in software) and try-before-buyers could offset the negative effects of lost sales. (Has anyone done this research?)<p>Anyway my point is that I don't think all theft is created equal, and that some kinds of theft do not dis-incentivize producers as the OP has asserted.",1264562523
1079668,comment,1079336,1079336,0,0,patio11,,,"I love you guys, but there is something to be said for using words like other people in the industry use the words.<p>The first time I noticed this was wrapping my head around funnels, which is a subject I'm fairly deeply experienced with.  The three magic words in that documentation are funnel, step, and goal.  In every other analytics tool I've ever encountered, the word ""goal"" is synonymous with conversion: somebody went through the funnel and reached a result which was positive for the business.  In Mixpanel, goal does not mean goal.  Goal apparently means ""step name"": for example, the first goal of the seven step funnel that represents the core interaction for my website is the Dashboard goal.  The second goal is the new card goal.  The third goal is... you get the general picture.  This breaks my brain every time I directly touch the API or docs.  I wrapped it in my own API and try not to think about it too much.<p>That is the prelude to me saying: your A/B tests are something potentially wonderful, but <i>they're not A/B tests.</i>  You're going to suffer an impedance mismatch when explaining them to anyone who knows what they're doing in testing because when you say the words ""A/B test"" we're going to think of something else.<p>An A/B test involves:<p>1)  A user interacting with an element which is subject to the test.  An element can be almost anything: a design feature, a bit of copy, an entire checkout workflow, whatever.<p>2)  The user being randomly assigned into one of two groups and shown the appropriate variation on the element.<p>3)  The user does some stuff.<p>4)  Hopefully, the user converts.<p>5)  You compare the propensity for conversion among the populations of users in each test group to see which performed better.<p>The solution you have delivered is different than A/B tests in many ways:<p>1)  It does not randomly partition users into groups.  That is, presumably, something your customers have to do prior to firing an event with the property (or super-property -- I forget what you call it) testWhatever: ""alternativeA"".<p>2)  A/B tests are cool not because A and B are cool letters but because they make statistical significance testing really easy, so that if alternative A has 20% more conversions than alternative B you can quickly tell whether that is solid evidence that A is indeed better or merely a possible artifact of random variation.  Your testing feature does not implement significance testing.<p>3)  There would normally be some halfhearted bow in the general direction of independence at this point (we mostly gloss over that and hope people forget stats 101 since, in practice, just wishing this requirement away tends to actually work acceptably) but the entire point of your stats feature is, as far as I can tell, taking the independence notion and beating it black or blue or purple and then seeing how that choice of color interacts with six other things.<p>Again: I like the feature.  I think that given an hour or two I will probably even be able to do something with it that will eventually make me money.  But if you try to communicate this as A/B testing you're going to cause a lot of unnecessary confusion.",1264562482

If I can write 1 line that is more readable and cost less to type, why should I use C++ ?<p>And by the way, C++ isn't a verbose python. And, even if I once thought that boost was the best thing ever made, I feel  that it's a waste of time. Instead of using meta-programming hacks to use lambda in a clumpsy/ugly way, why not simply use python or scheme ?",1264561650
