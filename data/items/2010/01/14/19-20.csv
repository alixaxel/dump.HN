Andrew did a nice job by continuing to ask questions like ""what did they want you to do with the money?"" and Noah again vacillated.

Aluminum alloys, by weight, can easily be three-times stronger than Steel alloys. By volume, I believe it can easily be ten-times stronger than steel. By a three-fold price increase over a standard container, I'm certainly betting they've got aluminium in there.<p>A fully aluminum container could be significantly stronger/lighter (not both) than a steel container, and it would have a significantly longer lifespan than steel as a rigid container could be virtually maintenance free for virtually ever. The only losses to the industry would likely be when a ship goes down, and then the containers would remain ready and waiting for salvage to return to work.<p>However turning the entire freight industry from Steel to Aluminium containers would probably require depleting all the earths aluminium reserves, and then likely require discovering an extra-terrestrial source and probably depleting that too.<p>Honestly, I don't think this new container will catch on for being light or collapsible.

If you compare people now with people 1000 years ago, it is obvious that the average IQ now is higher than it was then. If you compare with people 10k years ago, 100k ago .. no contest. There was a time when calculus was something only the smartest people in the world understood. Now it is a subject routinely taught in high school. All of human progress has been written by young people getting smarter than old people, and proving the old people wrong.<p>The question then should not be are young people smarter than old people, but is the difference in generational intelligence so great that it is noticeable? I don't know for sure the answer to that, but one has to ask what are the origins of the ageism prejudice in the first place.<p>Not saying that any kind of discrimination is acceptable, there certainly are highly intelligent, highly competent older people out there.

When I find the bug, it often seems far easier to fix the bug and start over than it would be to <i>both</i> fix the bug and track down all the consequences and fix those as well, perhaps writing some more code to help with that which might end up with bugs in it... my attention stack was never that large to begin with, and as it gets smaller I try harder and harder to avoid situations where I recursively just have to do this one more thing before I can do the thing I want to do.<p>I did run some of my images for weeks, and one webapp in particular for months.
