I already encountered malware specifically targeted to Firefox that was fully automatic.<p>It used some Mozilla specific JS hooks to launch Acrobat plugin. This in turn loaded tiny infected PDF that exploited some Acrobat security hole which allowed to directly execute code on your machine.<p>It was enough to visit a compromised website, no further user action required. All was happening automatically, practically invisible to the user. I only noticed it because Acrobat plugin is a massive resource hog, so I managed to kill it in time before it could execute a payload.",1263509988

1053712,comment,1052926,1053330,0,0,jerf,,,"REST-RPC is obviously possible, but would be additional stuff on top of REST, and... I guarantee you that REST advocates would flip out. By and large they think that having things that don't cleanly map down to RPC is a benefit; they would object that a function call lacks the richness to fully represent the results of a REST invocation: Did you get a cached value back? Can you get to the HTTP headers? Can you set cache header on the request itself, or other HTTP headers? And there's a lot of truth here. Basically, REST-RPC would be ""an RPC mechanism built on top of REST"", but would not be ""REST that is also RPC""; REST-RPC must necessarily be at least one of ""a significantly limited subset of REST"" or ""more complicated than a simple function call"".<p>Despite the fact I'm not willing to write off XML-RPC as absolutely useless as I believe there are times for simplicity, I also tend to agree that for industrial strength purposes RPC is a bad metaphor and you basically lose if you try to use RPC. It's just that I don't think REST is the right direction; I head more in the direction of message passing, as laid out in<p><a href=""http://www.erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2008-May/035207.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2008-May/03...</a><p>And REST would agree with at least some of that; at least REST isn't hiding the fact that your function call is not local from you. But it falls afoul of many of the  criticisms, too.",1263507441

But it also has the tendency to encourage a local rather than global focus, so that locally all the shapes look right, but the global proportions are wrong.  Or where you work your way around a bicycle wheel drawing all the negative shapes, and the last shape you draw is too wide or too thin.<p>Which isn't much of a problem for things like still lifes, but it becomes a bigger problem in, for example, portraiture, where the human eye is particularly sensitive to errors in proportion -- which is why Edwards includes some construction rules-of-thumb in her portraiture chapter.<p>You may be focusing too strongly on ""circles and squares"" as idealized shapes...  If you look at the picture of the elephant in the article, none of the shapes is quite a circle.  Rather, they outline masses, like the blobs you might see if you defocus your eyes.  Being able to capture the proportions and locations of these masses is actually very important when drawing from life. (see, for example, Nicolaides's ""The Natural Way to Draw"")",1263506844
