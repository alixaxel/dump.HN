1079969,comment,1039613,1042584,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"Good question -- and the answer is that systematic writing combined with widespread literacy tends to fossilize language, at least on the page. There is, for instance, a world of difference between written and spoken English, the written version being not too very different from what one might have expected to read in an eighteenth-century document. The vocabulary has changed somewhat, the modifiers less (ahem) magnificent, but the grammar (and the flow and phrasing) is essentially the same. In fact, it is really only semantic drift that prevents us from reading Shakespeare as easily as, say, Tom Wolfe. Even the spelling in today's written English reflects the pronunciation prevalent in the London area in the fifteenth century. None of us, though (or at least none of us who regularly interact with other English-speaking humans) would speak spontaneously in any way like the way we write. The situation is similar in other languages; in spoken French, for instance, one only hears the <i>ne verb pas</i> negation in the context of strong emphasis, the grammaticized <i>pas</i> having completely replaced the original negator <i>ne</i> in day-to-day speech. Only tweets, text messages and smilies will prevent English from being as static as written ""Chinese"".",1264574387

1079924,comment,1079621,1079817,0,0,waterlesscloud,,,"It's a sliding scale of box office gross that goes to the studios.  Believe it or not, each film has its own deal, and there isn't really a standard amount.  Bigger films can negotiate more for the distributor (studio) and less for the exhibitor (theater). The typical pattern is that the first weekend or two is very heavily slanted towards the distributor (as much as a 85/15 split, though 70/30 is more normal). Then the distributor's share goes down each weekend.<p>The rule of thumb is that over the course of a typical film, the distributor will receive about 55% of box office gross.  Foreign deals can differ a fair amount.<p>Each deal is different, and it's hard to say what any one film gets without some insider info.<p>Then there's the cost of the film.  There's not been a firm number on Avatar's production costs.  High 200s is a good guess, but it's a guess.<p>P&A (prints and advertising) can be a huge cost on something like Avatar, though it had fewer prints than a typical blockbuster.  Advertising was certainly substantial, though.  I suspect 100 million is actually low.<p>Cameron's share is likely defined to come after some sort of breakeven point, some minimum number the studio beancounters said had to come back to the studio.  There's really no standard whatsoever for someone like Cameron though, so who knows.<p>It's also important to remember that a lot of a film's production cost is really just the studio paying itself.  Soundstage rental.  Grip trucks, costuming, blah blah blah.  Money moving from one column to another.<p>Avatar probably didn't qualify for any tax credits, though some films get really amazing deals.  Some come close to having half their budgets in transferable tax credits, depending on the state or locale they shoot in.  Those tax credits can be sold for cash and can considerably lower the cost to a studio.<p>The traditional hope for an average film has been to break even on box office, profit on the ancillaries - dvd, tv, etc.  But with DVD sales dropping, that model will need some adjustment.<p>Avatar, though, is probably pretty close to some definition of profit in theatrical release.<p>And all that billion plus dollars is cash flow.  Which is king, as much in Hollywood as it is anywhere else.",1264573033

Often these are rapid-prototyping development tools and places where there's a need to generate very complex queries in a way compatible with different relational sources. Typically, though, the queries are not that complex and don't need to be generated dynamically so this sort of thing becomes just an exquisitely designed layer for more bugs to hide in.",1264572809

It's _not_ about changing how existing hobby industries work. The author has failed to look beyond the hobbyist examples used in the Wired article.<p>It's also about being able to enter niche markets that larger manufacturers aren't interested in. There are plenty of markets that require a high standard of complexity in both design and manufacturing, yet are too small for larger companies to care about. As the cost of both drops, so it becomes more viable.<p>Also, despite the author's disparaging remarks, being able to do small scale runs in China is significant, because not so long ago this was _inconcievable_ for many businesses.<p>It's fair to bash Wired for the hyperbole -- it's not a revolution yet -- but Giz's critique is shallow and doesn't address the basic argument; that the lowered cost has increased access to equipment and skills for industrial design and manufacture. That this change will lead to greater numbers of smaller businesess operating in new niche markets, or markets otherwise previously denied to them because of scale.",1264572305

   The question you should be asking is what makes Mac developers so vocal about their OS beliefs?  I think the answer you'll find is that they are so pleased with their Mac they feel compelled to share.<p>There's also a handful of fantastic development tools unique to OS X, two of my favorites being TextMate (RoR editor of choice by many), and Coda.  There's also obviously been large growth in Objective-C developers since the release of the iPhone, again something (unless you count mono) unique to OS X.",1264572185
