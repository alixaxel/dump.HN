I've written a number of compilers where operators were not defined at parse-time, but handled via macros that can be defined at any point.  This makes the logic for transforming infix operators very difficult.  If a change was made to make all operators operate left-to-right, this issue would go away.  What do you guys think about this?

My luck was to be involved in two companies that simply paid me a wage, they had a reasonably good idea at the time, they were good enough in their execution, one was 10 years ahead of its time (the idea has since been adopted and is now common practice), the other failed because of terrible planning and marketing.<p>My gain was as much or more looking from the position of a salaried employee and to learn as much as if it was my own company that failed.<p>If it hadn't been for those two projects I wouldn't have stood a chance in hell with my own business, even today I benefit from that experience.<p>The most important thing you can do if your project tanks is to really sit down and mine it for what its worth with respect to the lessons that you can learn from it. Then it's time well spent, otherwise it is wasted and you will likely make the same mistake(s) again.<p>Especially in a world that is moving so fast that during the lifetime of a single individual no single strategy will continue to work this is absolutely essential.<p>The days when you could invent a gadget and live your life long on the proceeds are pretty much gone, you are most likely not going to see many people be handed out golden watches for 50 years dedicated service to 'the company' in the future.<p>And that will only get worse, as product life cycles shorten and new inventions build on previous ones at an ever accelerating pace.",1262472126

Now, people aren't just losing their houses because they should never have bought them, they're losing them because they lost their jobs.  There's a shitload of extra money out there that's bound to come out as inflation sometime.  The government has added something like $2T of extra debt.  We've lost the confidence of the international community, who we need to finance our debt.  The government has basically blown its wad as far as fiscal and monetary stimulus goes.<p>So I dunno.

Take your first comment:<p>""The fact that women are even capable of conceiving of short-term sexual relationships is a sign that our society is impotent and dying.""<p>See, I'm not sure that's quite right, but I'm always open to being convinced. If you cited, for instance, the fall of Rome when making your point, or GDP per capita growth in traditional/modern societies, or population growth rates, well you might make a point. Instead you're just asserting that you're right.<p>> Everyone knows I'm right.<p>Like that. That doesn't work so well. Data, evidence, argument, counterargument. You've actually got some good arguments on your side - replacement rate in population growth, birthrates of the Islamic world vs. the rest of the world, and so on. I just got a copy of The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and I think Gibbons points to changes in Roman family life as one of the big causes. So, you could probably make a really interesting and nuanced argument that challenged our beliefs and made us think more.<p>Now, it goes against a lot of people here's base views, so it would likely receive mixed feedback, but it would definitely get some positive points and discussion going. Heck, I'd be up for reading and discussing with you if you made those arguments because I'm not sold either way on what's going to happen to modern society 100 years out - it's a fascinating and interesting topic. I think data, citations, research, books, and a more flushed out argument and you could really make some interesting points and get some good discussion going.",1262471243

But I'm really happy Daniel bit the bullet and built it because I think it is a useful thing to have.<p>The 'Failure is not an option' mentality that some seem to bring to the start-up scene always has me in stitches, because it is really terribly naive to think that somehow you are different and bullet proof. After a couple of failures you begin to get the hang of how to avoid failure in the ways that you've already seen before, and you find new, interesting ways to fail.<p>But everytime you 'fail', you also simultaneously succeed, you succeed in learning, in educating yourself. Three failed start-ups is probably the equivalent of a badge of merit and positions you very well for a possible success the fourth or the fifth time. It's not <i>just</i> luck, it is a combination of a lot of factors:<p><pre><code>  - idea

  - timing
  
  - team

  - execution

  - luck

  - interaction with customers / audience

  - market development
</code></pre>
All those have to go your way to hit one out of the park. But at the same time you could be defining success as for instance building a site that attracts more than 'x' visitors per day, or being ramen profitable, or being able to live comfortably of your product.<p>If I look back across the years my own score is a mixed bag:<p><pre><code>  - successful consultancy business

  - successful license business

  - homerun on the webcam stuff

  - a string of 'moderately successful' (as in lots of 
    users but not much $)

  - two major losses

  - a string of failures, most of them small ideas 
    worked out over a period of days, weeks or months.
</code></pre>
If you're not prepared to 'take your lumps' the success will also never be yours, so plan ahead, know that if you start a project you can skew the odds a bit in your favor by manipulating those factors that are directly under your control and if you fail make sure you get the maximum mileage of your 'failure' in terms of study points.<p>Then try again, with the odds more in your favor because of your increased knowledge.

A lot of the things that happened (break-in, heart attack, etc.) were black swans that probably can't be avoided in the future. I did learn some important lessons though.<p>- Make sure your co-founders are as engaged as you are. I would even go as far as to say that if you can't find someone that really believes in the idea and is willing to put some serious work behind it it's better to go it alone.<p>- Make sure expectations are squared off, and you don't oversell the promise of riches. Most startups fail, and your co-founders need to know this. Otherwise you'll end up with broken friendships, which is never a good thing.<p>- Learn to code. When I looked back I saw that if I had been able to code I would have been a much better manager and founder, and would probably have been able to do a lot of the stuff that gave us so much trouble myself. I've since become pretty proficient at PHP, MySql and CSS. And I'm learning python and javascript.<p>The stuff I'm working on now is coded by myself, and I'm doing it alone. Not because I don't want a co-founder, far from it, but I don't want to have a co-founder that drags the whole venture down.",1262470116

Hiring friends as designer and as programmer to work remote and for shares of the company has a high chance of disaster, especially if you are not a developer yourself.<p>One thing that might help could be setting up a schedule where you work together at a co-working place or your local hacker club, etc.",1262470071

This is needed for wear-leveling, so you might as well also use it for thin provisioning (aka trim), dedupe, etc. In the worst case, one read command may require reading several pages of metadata from flash to find the data. Because flash is fundamentally so fast, an SSD can tolerate a lot of overhead and still be faster than a hard disk.",1262469986

It is the best of both worlds. Hopefully by disagreeing we'll explain what we're talking about more.<p>I remember reading Founders At Work. One of the points that one of the founders made was ""don't try to read too many business books"" His point, I think, was that it was really easy to fill your head with lots of great ideas. And executing was more important than all of them.<p>There was a saying I heard once: work on sales and all your other problems will take care of themselves. It doesn't mean that other things aren't important, just that there are some key metrics for any business.<p>I've spent a lot of time reading a lot of books (and HN) about startups. I think finally it's all congealed with me -- I got it. Perhaps I am sadly disillusioned, but I don't scratch my head like I used to any more. When I read an article like the one I read today, I don't think ""What kind of idiots wouldn't invest in such a cool idea?"" Instead I think ""Wonder why the community has failed this person such that he expects something much different than what he got?""<p>I'm done commenting, though.
