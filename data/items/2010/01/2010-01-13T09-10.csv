Something like two months before expiration, one month before expiration, then two weeks, one week, then 5 days, then every day for the next 5.  To save your credit all you have to do is make a call, it can last for less than a second if you want.  I think they give reasonable notifications of expiring credit.",1263376713

2) Keeping notes collected. We're week on this right now, but I'm looking forward to being able to click on a project and seeing all my meetings/notes from that project.<p>—P",1263376363
