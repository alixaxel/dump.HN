1063516,comment,1062978,1062978,0,0,grellas,,,"I have been advising owners of C Corps, S Corps, and LLCs, among others, for years and feel I can wade in on this.<p>Part of the issue here is political, with the government wanting to enlarge its tax-revenue base and with small business owners wanting to minimize taxes they pay.<p>Another part of the issue deals with the fairness of taxing pass-through entities such as S Corps and LLCs for employment taxes. Remember that such entities can consist of owners who are employees and also of owners who are not. When such entities make profits on their operations, they can keep the profits in the company to fund growth, they can distribute all profits to their owners, or they can keep part of the profits in the company and distribute the rest to owners. Whether the profits are distributed or not, they are treated as net income of the entity and are ""passed through"" for tax purposes to the owners of the entity, who in turn must each report their allocable share of such profits as a line item on their individual income tax returns and pay income tax on them accordingly. This is true of both employee owners and non-employee owners.<p>The idea behind a pass-through entity is that owners can escape the burden of a double tax that would otherwise apply on profits were such profits to be taxed once at the entity level and then again on their distributions to owners of the entity as dividends. This idea derives from old-style partnership law, which has always taxed partnerships in pass-through fashion, in contrast to corporate law, which has always taxed C corporations at the entity level and then again whenever dividends were declared and paid to shareholders.<p>The pass-through idea is good and bad for S Corp shareholders and LLC members. It means that income tax issues are much simplified and income taxes minimized. Since the imputation of profits to owners is automatic, whether or not profits are actually paid out to such owners, it also means that owners can incur phantom income, and have to pay tax on it, if profits are not actually paid out.<p>When it comes to employment taxes, however, the issue becomes more complicated.<p>The broad idea behind employment taxes is that anyone who earns wages or salary as an employee or who makes profits while working a business directly as a proprietor is required to pay into Social Security, Medicare, etc.<p>Current tax law penalizes LLCs in this respect because it imposes employment taxes on all owners of the business, whether they are employees of the business or not. In other words, it simply presumes that anyone who would set up an LLC would do so to work in it directly and, thus, should be required to pay employment taxes on any profits from that business.<p>The rule with S Corps is actually fairer in this respect. With an S Corp, owners <i>employed by the business</i> are required by law to pay themselves ""reasonable"" salaries for services rendered to the business. Those salaries are then taxed to such individuals directly as employment income and the individuals who receive them pay both income tax and employment taxes on the amounts received as salary. Any profits that are passed through to shareholders other than as salary/wages, however, are <i>not</i> subject to employment taxes. This means that non-employee owners of an S Corp will pay income taxes on their pass-through income but not employment taxes. It also means that employee-owners will pay both income tax and employment tax on their salaries but will pay no employment tax on amounts earned in excess of their salaries.<p>The gist of this article is to suggest that S Corp owners have systematically abused their position by understating the salaries they pay to themselves and using this as a way of avoiding employment taxes on their true income. The corrective, it is assumed, would be to subject all S Corp income to employment taxes as well as income taxes.<p>There is clearly an unfair disparity between the way S Corps and LLCs are taxed in this respect. However, it is not necessarily more fair to subject all S Corp income to employment taxes. Such a change would impose employment taxes on all non-employee owners of an S Corp and make them pay things such as Social Security tax on income that for them is purely investment income.<p>The problem here is an audit problem, given that the S Corp rules already use a theoretically fair system for deciding which aspect of a company's profits is fairly allocable to ""employment"" as opposed to ""ownership.""<p>How that problem is corrected, then, turns into a political issue. For those favoring the government's broad ability to tax away, it means closing a loophole. For those favoring the ability of small businesses to pay fair employment taxes tied to actual employment activity by owners, the current system is fine.<p>While it might be argued that the current system is abused, and hence that the current S Corp rules should be changed, a similar argument might be made about under-reporting of income by small businesses generally. The question is, because some cheat, should all be penalized? I tend to think not but, as I said, this becomes as much a political issue as anything else at this stage, and not a legal one. People will differ on the best resolution.",1263941659

1063492,story,,,7,11,olalonde,"Ask HN: Review my rapid AJAX idea",,"I've started writing a Javascript library for rapidly implementing / prototyping AJAX on a web page. Here is how it works:<p>When you click a link, the foreign web page is DIFFed with the current page with a server script and the script returns what has changed on the current page in the JSON format. For example,<p><pre><code>  [
    {
        ""action"" : ""delete"",
        ""path"" : ""/p[1]""
    },
    {
        ""action"" : ""modify"",
        ""path"" : ""/ul[1]/li[1]"",
        ""node"" : {
            ""innerHTML"" : ""modified 1st line"",
            ""attributes"" : {
                ""class"" : ""testClass""
            }
        }
    },
    {
        ""action"" : ""insert"",
        ""parentPath"" : ""/ul[1]"",
        ""siblingPath"" : ""/li[3]"", 
        ""node"" : {
            ""tagName"" : ""li"",
            ""innerHTML"" : ""should insert after 2nd item"",
            ""attributes"" : []
        }
    }
  ]
</code></pre>
This would delete the first paragraph, modify the 1st list item in the 1s unordered list and insert a new list item before the 3rd list item in the first unordered list.<p>Of course, there are several limitations:<p>- innerHTML isn't a standard (actually, xmlhttp isn't either afaik)<p>- Dynamically modifying the DOM might interfere with other Javascript present on the page<p>However, this library could be used to unobtrusively implement AJAX without having to write a single line of Javascript (all you would have to do is embedded the script in the header).<p>A use case of this library could be for a blog where you have a link ""Show comments"". Instead of the browser loading the whole page with blog comments, the request is sent asynchronously to the server script which diffs the current page and the page with comments. It then returns the modifications to the current page and the Javascript then updates the DOM with the information sent by the server script.<p>I had a hard time putting this idea into words and I hope I made myself clear. So far, I've done the Javascript part and what remains is the server side diff script.<p>In a nutshell:<p>- Productivity boost VS writing AJAX by hand, unobtrusive<p>- May interfere with other Javascript code<p>I would appreciate some feedback on the idea!<p>EDIT: This idea came from my frustration of having to wait for the whole DOM to be rendered by web browsers when clicking links within a site. Often times, a big part of the DOM structure remains the same and yet, your browser has to render everything once again. Do you think this ""concept"" (DIFFing and only rendering what has changed) could be applied directly to the browser to make rendering faster ? The main limitation I see is compatibility problems with Javascript and if the DIFF process would be actually faster.",1263941138

1063476,comment,1062978,1062978,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"The problem is actually the opposite, that S-Corp is not a scam but LLC is a tax hawk.  If your bootstrapped startup ever becomes profitability, you will learn quickly that taxation (with or without representation) is your number one cost (more than labor, more than sales and marketing).  First you pay 15.3% self-employment tax, then 35% Federal tax, then 9.3% State tax (if you live in California) and finally 9.25% sales tax (if you live the Bay Area), that's 69% tax before net profit (necessary for rainy days).  As my good friend Art once told me, everyone eventually becomes a ""conservative"", you just have to have something to ""conserve"" first.  I immediately became a conservative when I saw profit and I believe you will too.  If you want to avoid double-taxation (i.e., first tax as an individual, then as a Corporation), then you have two choices. You can form an LLC or you can form a S-Corp.  The advantage of LLC is that there is a lot less legal overhead and there is no restriction with foreign ownership (this is a big deal if you happen to have a co-Founder who is not a US resident or citizen or if you have partners overseas). The problem with LLC is that <i>ALL</i> of your profits are taxed as self-employment income (15.3% off the top).  On the other hand, with S-Corp, you do need to pay yourself a market-value salary (or you will be subject to audit so it is never a scam as some commenters would suggest).  In my own experience, the optimal solution turns out to be that of forming your startup as an LLC but file a S-Corp (form 1120S).

And indeed, they've got good arguments.

As far as I know, nobody rich is doing this. If they're stashing it under their mattress, I don't think they'd have gotten rich in the first place. If they've got it invested in stocks or bonds or even banks, then it's not idle and doing nothing. It's helping other people finance their businesses, buy houses, whatever. But it's <i>definitely</i> doing something useful. In fact, it's doing something so useful that the people using the money are willing to rent it from them.<p>Contrast this to government spending, which according to Keynesian theory could be used by paying people to dig holes and fill them back in, so long as the government is doing this. In the Keynesian model (that Obama and the rest of the government is using), the money does not get used productively. When the rich guy rents his money to someone willing to pay for it, it's much more likely to find good use.",1263940736

It had a good ""hook"" up front with the slightly crazed store owner, and then led into a pretty good description of Yelp's impact on businesses.   As a frequent Yelp contributor, and reader, I'd say that 95-99% of reviews are honest, forthright, and make an attempt at some kind of balance.  I'm actually quite impressed at how effective Yelp is at keeping both the trolls and shill reviews off their site.<p>The downside of the Yelp ""Anti-Shill"" algorithm is that it does to tend to have a lot more false positives than false negatives.  As a result, infrequent, or new Yelp reviewers will typically have their reviews dropped off the site, or not appear to accounts other than theirs - New Yelp reviewers may not be aware that their Yelp reviews may appear to their logins, but not to others.<p>The foundation of Yelp, of course, are the ""Elite"" reviewers - They are the equivalent of the ""Wikipedia Admins"" - by themselves, they are obviously fallable.  As a group, you can trust them - particularly the best of the best - someone like <a href=""http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=P5bUL3Engv-2z6kKohB6qQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=P5bUL3Engv-2z6kKohB6...</a> is more trustworthy than any restaurant critic you've ever read in the NYT.  I can attest his credibility is untouchable, and, with Yelp, you can get a _dozen_ reviews by people like him of high-profile places.<p>Is Yelp Perfect - No.  Have they had salespeople (typically teenagers or people in their early twenties) say things on the phone during cold calling that they shouldn't have?  Absolutely.  Do they maintain a pretty damn good wall between Sales and Advertising/Services - Nowadays, yes.  I don't know if that was _always_ the case, but I don't have any strong evidence to the contrary.  Just rumor and innuendo.  Regardless, they are a pretty upstanding act these days.<p>I'd be interested if anyone has any real evidence of poor behavior lately? I think this is more like Mark Pincus's speech that ""when you are small, and struggling, you do all sorts of things that you'd rather not do - Just so you can get to a stage _where you don't have to do those things_ anymore.""<p>I think Yelp is now at that stage.",1263940267

The same as any other normal person. Yes, they are likely to consume more luxury goods, but in the end, it does not cover the fact that the more money you have, the easier it is to get even more.<p>For examples of this you need to look no further than your local bank and see what premium rates they offer for people with high balances. Index funds offer ultra low expense rates for people with a lot of money. With a large proportion of money, it becomes possible for you to manipulate the markets by buying out competition, and becoming a monopoly: which is arguably the equilibrium state for any free-market. The monopoly is the most profitable situation for any business, and this is at odds with society.<p>So the more money you acrue, the higher your money/work rate becomes. This is a perverse incentive for the large corporation owners to not work as hard; and also to lay off workers during recessions. What sane company would be hiring when workers/consumers have less money to spend?<p>And the less work that is put into the economy, the worse off the economy is. This cruel cycle is why the economy was in a deflationary spiral and why ""Helicopter"" Ben is printing money as fast as he can.<p>This has a communist vibe, but in the end there is simply no argument that it is much better for the country to  utilize the resources and wealth to stimulate the economy as a whole than letting a few people sit on it so they can get richer by doing nothing with it.<p>The poor and middle class can't just create their own wealth because they don't own ""the means of production"" or the intellectual property horded by megacorps and protected by megacorp lawyers and lobbyists.<p>It is analogous to not letting DeBeers sit on a stockpile of diamonds, except instead of diamonds, it is money, food, gas, homes, etc...",1263939320

Initially (2004), I began with CVS and then moved to SVN and in the second half of last year, to git (after a one-year period of personal use of git-svn).<p>We deploy the application for our customers - sometimes to our own servers (both self-hosted and in the cloud) and sometimes to their machines.<p>Until middle year, as a consequence of SVN's really crappy handling of branches (it can branch, but it fails at merging), we did very incremental development, adding features on customer requests and bugfixes as needed, often times uploading specific fixes to different sites, committing them to trunk, but rarely ever updating existing applications to trunk to keep them stable.<p>Huge mess.<p>With the switch to git, we also initiated a real release management, doing one feature release every six months and keeping the released versions on strict maintenance (for all intents and purposes - the web application is highly customizable and we do make exceptions in the customized parts as to react to immediate feature-wishes of clients).<p>What we are doing git-wise is the reverse of what the article shows: Bug-fixes are (usually) done on the release-branches, while all feature development (except of these customizations) is done on the main branch (we just use the git default name ""master"").<p>We branch off of master when another release date nears and then tag a specific revision of that branch as the ""official"" release.<p>There is a central gitosis repository which contains what is the ""official"" repository, but every one of us (4 people working on this - so we're small compared to other projects I guess) has their own gitorious clone which we heavily use for code-sharing and code review (""hey - look at this feature I've done here: Pull branch foobar from my gitorious repo to see..."").<p>With this strict policy of (for all intents and purposes) ""fixes only"" and especially ""no schema changes"", we can even auto-update customer installations to the head of their respective release-branches which keeps their installations bug-free. This is a huge advantage over the mess we had before.<p>Now. As master develops and bug-fixes usually happen on the branch(es), how do we integrate them back into the mainline?<p>This is where the concept of the ""Friday merge"" comes in.<p>On Friday, my coworker or I usually merge all changes in the release-branches upwards until they reach master. Because it's only a week worth of code, conflicts rarely happen and if they do, we remember what the issue was.<p>If we do a commit on a branch that doesn't make sense on master because master has sufficiently changed or a better fix for the problem is in master, then we mark these with [DONTMERGE] in the commit message and revert them as part of the merge commit.<p>On the other hand, in case we come across a bug during development on master and we see how it would affect production systems badly (like a security flaw - not that they happen often) and if we have already devised a simple fix that is save to apply to the branch(es), we fix those on master and then cherry-pick them on the branches.<p>This concept of course heavily depends upon clean patches, which is another feature git excels at: Using features like interactive rebase and interactive add, we can actually create commits that<p>* Either do whitespace or functional changes. Never both.<p>* Only touch the lines absolutely necessary for any specific feature or bug<p>* Do one thing and only one.<p>* Contain a very detailed commit message explaining exactly what the change encompasses.<p>This on the other hand, allows me to create extremely clean (and exhaustive) change logs and NEWS file entries.<p>Now some of these policies about commits were a bit painful to actually make everyone adhere to, but over time, I was able to convince everybody of the huge advantage clean commits provide even though it may take some time to get them into shape (also, you gain that time back once you have to do some blame-ing or other history digging).<p>Using branches with only bug-fixes and auto-deploying them, we can increase the quality of customer installations and using the concept of a ""Friday merge"", we make sure all bug-fixes end up in the development tree without each developer having to spend an awful long time to manually merge or without ending up in merge-hell where branches and master have diverged too much.<p>The addition of gitorious for easy exchange of half-baked features to make it easier to talk about code before it gets ""official"" helped to increase the code quality further.<p>git was a tremendous help with this and I would never in my life want to go back to the dark days.<p>I hope this additional insight might be helpful for somebody still thinking that SVN is probably enough :-)",1263939008
