1043736,comment,1043498,1043566,0,0,Retric,,,"There are many useful definitions of wisdom and intelligence.  Another way of looking at it was if you where able to write a book that would be transported back in time to some historical figure what would be the most powerful things to add to change the course of history?  30 years ago detailed instructions on how to manufacture a modern computer would have dramatically changed things, but 2000 years ago that would be useless.  However, a basic primmer on math and collage freshman level science could have dramatically changed history.<p>IMO, wisdom is the ability to take the core aspects of what humanity has learned and put them into practice.  Eat right, exercise, get enough sleep, treat others well etc, those ideas evolve slowly over time.  So, what separates them is how quickly the information becomes outdated, 60 years ago knowing how to make a high quality vacuum tube on the cheap would have been useful today it's almost worthless.  Knowing how to use a light switch on the other hand seems far more basic.

One of the conclusions we came up with was that in med school the professors and attending docs have no investment in the students, unlike profs who rely on students to do their research. This lack of dependence seems to lead to an incredible amount of politics and what is essentially ass kissing (with the goal of getting recommendation letters), something I never really saw from students when I was in (physics) grad school. Research students rely on performance.<p>I'd say you can probably extend your comment about merit based admissions to science and engineering (and probably other types of grad school). In physics you generally don't even interview. They just look at your scores, grades, publications, letters, etc., then make an offer. After that they will invite you for a visit. They don't care about things like extra curricular activities or where you grew up. They would like more minorities/women, though.",1263159090

1043697,comment,1043190,1043190,0,0,dasht,,,"Here is one possible (plausible) answer to Fermi, I think:<p>Some various assumptions:<p>Space travel is limited by the speed of light and the faster you are going, the more energy it takes to go a little bit faster.  Relatively is more or less correct and absolute that way.   No Star Trek ""hyperdrive"" is possible.<p>Nope, you can't extract energy from a quantum vaccuum or any other such tricks.<p>Nope, you can't actually scoop up all that much fuel in inter-stellar space.  Most viable solar systems don't have all that much practically accessible fuel for inter-stellar voyages.  Transmutation of matter into arbitrary elements is possible, but not practical at scale.<p>You can't, therefore, have (material) trade routes between any but perhaps the closest stars.   Even then, the total mass of material you are trading in a unit of time is doomed to be disappointingly low - there is hardly any point to bothering.<p>With assumptions along those lines, ""colonization"" per se would not exactly be possible -- if by ""colonization"" we mean building any kind of empire.<p>At the very best, a species could accomplish a kind of ""panspermia"" -- sending out ""seeds"" to whatever stars are in reach, but once a seed is launched, its subsequent evolution is pretty much on its own.   In a few cases, if one lucky civilization is close by a second, resource-rich solar system, <i>maybe</i> you get get a little bit of mining going.   But such opportunities would be cosmologically rare and even more rarely economically viable.<p>Worse, sending out seeds to a near-ish solar system and letting them do what they will would be dangerous to the life back in the solar system of origin.   Right now, it doesn't appear that their is a hostile, alien intelligence anywhere in the galactic neighborhood.   If we did a good job of launching ""seeds"", we'd increase the odds considerably.<p>In short, there will never be a point at which it makes any kind of economic or existential sense for us to begin a colonization project - and the situation doesn't look like it would be all that different for other imaginable forms of life.<p>So why not signal?   Well, we already do a bit.  Perhaps in a few years we'll have found some not <i>too</i> far off (but far enough!) solar systems that look like they might host life -- and we'll point some lasers at them and start sending ""pings"" to see if anyone is home.   If other solar systems are already doing that, it would be very hard to detect from here on Earth.<p>In other words, one answer to Fermi, but not quite the ""Great Filter"" that Bostrom posits, is simply that galactic colonization is a practical impossibility and, to the extent there is intelligent signaling that spans solar systems, it's a lot more directional and harder to detect than anything you could easily find with a few radio telescopes.",1263159037

The aesthetic beauty should be in the end result.<p>Which also means it probably isn't science, because really what I worry about when I'm programming is that the end result will be correct.\nTo some extent I am concerned about scientific process, having a program that is repeatably verifiable as doing what I expect, but in terms of actually using scientific methods to write software, I can't really say I do that very much. As with the beauty, the science is in the end result and not really the process.<p>Which brings me to why I think it is applied philosophy:<p>What am I doing when I write code? I am taking a problem and deconstructing it into different pieces, finding ways to represent the different pieces, and reasoning about how everything should interact. I think this basically holds true for functional, object oriented, and imperative programming.<p>I think that from this perspective, writing code is closest to some sort of philosophical inquery.
