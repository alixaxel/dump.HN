And if it was a C function in a larger project, you probably wouldn't want to inline it because that would slow your compile times and cause you to lose modularity (i.e. you'd have to rebuild all client code rather than just update the DSO when you optimize the distance function).  This function does enough work that it doesn't deserve to be inlined.",1264701550

Media companies think they are only about media and media partnerships and not about the entire ecosystem that delivers that media. Sadly, this means the technology responsible for storing, maintaining, delivering, and reporting on the media is often under-staffed, under-funded, and under-prioritized. They can hire all the engineers they want, but unless they're willing to listen to them and consider the entire system, that's not going to make headways on their needs.",1264701491

1084482,comment,1084116,1084160,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,">>The question posed at the end is an interesting one: at the moment, the iPad appears to require a regular computer (just like an iPod touch does). Presumably a future version - or even a software update for the existing model - will get rid of this dependency.<p>Apple's paradigm is that the devices revolve around the main computer, and I don't see that changing.  However, it could be that the ""main computer"" evolves into a headless thing (like the new Mac Mini Server) that auto-magically handles the Ethernet, USB devices, and mass storage for the iPad(s).  Plug it into the wall, the router, and the printer, and it finds the iPad(s) via Bonjour on your wireless network.  Your Mac Mini Server (MMS) downloads your upgrades for you, stores your media, and backs up your contacts and files.  It works like a remote harddrive.  Just drag files you don't need any more over to its home screen icon, and they're kept on the server now.  It's also your hub to access your digital camera or other USB device, and shares them over 802.11n to the iPad(s).<p>Then, a few years later, when our Mobile Me accounts have like 5 TB limits and enough people have HD-streaming broadband, that computer can be replaced by a simple dock with an Ethernet port and USB for the printers and cameras.  Apple's getting $99/year instead of $500 for the server, but still making bank.  You buy stuff on iTunes and it automatically appears on your iDisk.  You download it when you sync your iPad with your iDisk and put it in your iPad's library.  Tired of that song?  Throw it out on the iPad and download it again later.",1264701466

A simple square macro will be faster than the expt function, because expt does special calculations for dealing with decimal exponents. All you really need to do is multiply it by itself.

    (let ((symb (gensym)))
      `(let ((,symb ,expression))

    `(the single-float (* ,deg ,(/ (coerce pi 'single-float) 180))))<p>And avoid a couple of function calls and some multiplication.

You admit that increasing CO2 concentrations increase temperature and human emissions increase atmospheric CO2 concentrations yet you suggest that it's solar storms which have increased the temperature.  Why, as a black body increasing earth temperature from incoming radiation is hard, it's  temperature ^ 4  = e which takes a lot of energy for a small increase.<p>Modeling what the net effects are is a complex topic.  Doing a proper cost benefit analysis of reducing carbon emissions is hard.  But, we could produce all the energy the US needs from wind and solar, we could even create hydrocarbons from atmospheric CO2 + water, saying that’s not an option is a false choice.  The real question is how far should we change, at what cost and for what benefit.  I don't know the answers to that question, but I suspect the optimum choice is less costly than what most might while still dramatically altering carbon emissions.<p>PS: The total carbon emissions from all cars driven in the US is about the same as produced from coal fires in China, if you focus on low cost solutions to the global problem there is a lot of low hanging fruit.",1264700432

Decisions that are not life-and-death are much more difficult to make in a startup. They are actually much more important to the success of a startup. Making good decisions in startups obviously requires experience but it also requires good judgment. And good judgment has to do with when and how to build up creditability with your co-Founders and your shareholders, and when and how to cash in your political earned capital to mobilize the company behind an unpopular decision that you have made based on imperfect data. More importantly, good judgment has to do with maintaining a positive feedback loop to constantly re-up your credibility with your constituents so that you do not inadvertently over-extend your reserve.
