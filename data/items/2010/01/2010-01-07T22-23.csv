Copyright protects against direct duplication of a work, while patents protect against a range of possible implementations.<p>For example, if you install a copy of Microsoft Word on your computer off of a friend's CD, you are violating Microsoft's copyright.  If you instead write your own word processor from scratch, then you are not violating; Microsoft's copyright is independent from the copyright you hold on your word processor.  But if Microsoft has a patent on a fundamental aspect of word processors, then your new word processor violates the patent, and Microsoft can limit what you can do with it.<p>The question is: Is the ""risky and costly project"" the act of implementing the word processor, or the act of inventing word processors in the first place?

Right now we're displaying only 10 people in the result set, we could charge people to see, say, 100 results.  (This is one of Linkedin's business model. )<p>#2. Deep drill-down: eg, you want to check out Dustin's tweets about memcached  http://bit.ly/5uV6hW,  we only show matches within last 12 months.  Potentially we could show all of them or even allow user to click on the monthly breakdown to filter by month.  Deep index is one of our advantages.<p>#3. Automated Twitter list: eg, if you want to follow people who talks about couchdb, you'll have to click each follow link and maintain the twitter list by yourself. We've already got the code to make a search into a 'dynamic list' sync with search results.<p>#4. Adsense type news.  Allow people pay to put their ads onto the search results.<p>What do you think?

Of course this doesn't work. We take away guns and bombs, so the terrorists use box cutters. We take away box cutters and corkscrews, and the terrorists hide explosives in their shoes. We screen shoes, they use liquids. We limit liquids, they sew PETN into their underwear. We implement full-body scanners, and they're going to do something else. This is a stupid game; we should stop playing it.""</i><p>And do away with the restrictions? As much as I dislike dealing with the TSA, some of these rules have made it far more difficult for terrorists to bring down or hijack an airplane. I'm sure I am not the only one who remembers the bad old days when criminals, mentally ill people, non-suicidal terrorists, and political extremists would regularly hijack flights here and abroad. I can't remember the last time it's happened, because now it's nearly impossible for anyone to bring on weapons or get into the cockpit.<p>I also disagree with his conclusion that people reacted with ""fear"" to the Christmas day attempt. Most of the reaction I saw was relief and anger.",1262901681
