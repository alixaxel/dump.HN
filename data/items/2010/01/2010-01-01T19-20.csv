1026138,comment,1025975,1025975,0,0,lrm242,,,"Maven sucks, yes. But, right now, Maven is the best solution for Java projects. This is why:<p>If you use it right you end up with 1 source of truth for your build. Most Java IDEs support maven as a project model, and therefore you don't have to maintain two separate builds: one for the IDE and one for the build system--something that always leads to integration pain.<p>Ant as a tool isn't capable of this, since it doesn't really represent an project object model. Certainly IDEs can invoke Ant targets, but their non-standard nature make tight integration with the IDE hard, if not impossible.<p>There are several things that Maven could do to make the experience better. I suspect many of them will be addressed in 3.0; however, Maven as an experience has always sucked and I suspect will always suck. The broad based acceptance of the tool will give it a certain inertia that is likely going to be hard to overcome.",1262375233

1026130,comment,1025878,1025878,0,0,thwarted,,,"<i>They'd say, ""We want to be this far along by July,"" or ""By August we need to be able to handle these types of transactions."" I'd ask them how they'd established those deadlines. The answer was always the same: No businessperson had asked for a specific amount of progress by a specific date, but the team had decided how far along it needed to be at various checkpoints to feel good about the overall progress.</i><p>It's unfortunate that the author had this awesome insight, and then went off on a tangent about people being more comfortable with schedule pressure than with quality pressure.<p>""Feeling good about the overall progress"" as presented above isn't schedule pressure, it's a measure of quality and efficiency.  ""We want to be this far along by July"" is a way for the team themselves to gauge if, for example, they are spinning their wheels doing the wrong thing (because it's taking too long, because it's too hard, because it's not broken down into subtasks properly, whathaveyou), which directly relates to quality.  As this ""deadline"" approaches, one can judge if with greater accuracy if it's going to be made.  And since these ""deadlines"" are not hard and fast, or at least not as hard and fast as if some business person had set them, tweaking them is less work and less upsetting.  Don't think all seven of the transaction types are going to be done by August? Scale it back to five, work on getting it into a state where these five can be handed off to the next team to work on the next part and build it such that new transaction types can be added later so more people can work in parallel.  Dependency handling (with the core dependency getting the project in a shippable state within a reasonable amount of time) is the reason schedule pressure exists in the first place.<p>I've often had to say to my team ""We seem to be spending a lot of time on X, and are close to [or past] the initial estimates for completion.  Are we doing the right thing here?  What else are we going to have to cut?  What do <i>you want</i> to cut?  Is it too complex, and can we simplify it?"".  Too often, even the list of things (features) that need to be in the final product are determined externally (read: by business people), without any input from the people who are actually going to do be doing the work.  The implementing team should be involved in both the feature list and the schedule (a regular topic on HN).  I've been on both sides of the table too many times where there is a ""technical"" resource included in the scheduling planning/meetings just for show and their insight and participation is discouraged, usually because promises have already been made and the planning meeting is just a big Tetris game, an attempt to fit a bunch of lines and shapes into a fixed size box.<p>That all being said, bluishgreen's comments about revolving around the customer are spot on too.  A lot of that comes down to handling expectations.  In my experience, schedule pressure is often the result of improperly used Gantt charts.  Gantt charts should be living documentation used to answer questions about scheduling and dependencies, not a static bible to be used to browbeat people (both the implementors and the customer) into buying into some fantasy dates.",1262375041

And the more I listen to music, the more quickly I'm able to break down new music that I listen to.<p><i>Most of us are born with some ability like this.</i><p>Exactly why I'm confused as to your initial point:<p><i>A lot of people just don't have the wherewithal to appreciate melodic music. Melody just escapes them.</i><p>Now, in modern music there <i>is</i> a branch that focuses on rhythm more than it does on melody (in classical music as well as in pop). However, that branch is still <i>exceedingly</i> rare compared to the rest of what's coming out. People who listen to Lady Gaga, the Jonas Brothers, and J-Lo are all listening to music for its melodies. So it's not the fact that classical music is melodic that turns them off.<p>My suspicion is that a part of it is an inability to really sympathize with the music.

Basically, when all the children of the family are young they play and do everything together. Childhood friends are likely to be mostly cousins and siblings. Once kids reach a certain age the genders are rigidly separated (with the burka, and adjusted living arrangements). The upshot of this is by the time a young Muslim man is ready to marry, the only women he is familiar with are the girls he grew up with. That is, his cousins.<p>Further, the etiquette of marriage is extremely complicated in and involves the mutual cooperation of the entire family of both the bride and the groom. So it's a much less complicated affair if the bride and the groom come from the same family--there simply won't be as many disagreements.<p>It should be noted that cousin-marriage is increasingly uncommon among the more affluent Muslims in countries like the UAE and Bahrain.",1262373555

Support for multiple source-based projects that depend on each other felt bolted on. I can't remember the details, but you couldn't build more than one project from source without specifying a link to a parent project from each child project, which then referenced each of its children.<p>I've written and rewritten countless build systems (from batch files last millenium to Ant/NAnt/MSBuild) and they always end up being simple wrappers over javac/junit that manage transitive dependencies and build cycle ordering. The tricky part is ensuring that your IDE's dependencies match those in your build system.<p>I recommend Ivy as an alternative to straight Ant or Maven that does dependencies and ordering well, but doesn't require you to buy in to any special build philosophy: <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/ivy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ant.apache.org/ivy/</a><p>Quick addendum: Ivy has its own quirks and is far too complex under the hood for my taste, but does the job well if you stick to straight dependency management.

Problem is, with that music I came on listening to it as if it were a song and not a composition. When I listen to Steve Reich's Music For 18 Musicians, the first music I think to compare it to is Sufjan Stevens, who's a pop songwriter. Or I'll listen to Philip Glass and think of rock riffs. The problem is that for those more modern musicians (and for certain older, less well-known ones) is that we don't have the same conservative respect for them, and we have fewer interpretations of their music. When I listen to Einstein on the Beach, there are only two known recordings, and they're of music that's so innovative that your thoughts aren't about the interpretation, they're about the design of the music period.<p>(I'd also like to add, as an aside, that Hacker News sees the most <i>bizarre</i> stories submitted.

Or, are you assuming that your particular perceptions represent the <i>entire spectrum</i> of listeners of electronic music.  I doubt that's warranted.<p>What you do is fundamental to the human experience -- having a bit of music stuck in one's head.  Most of us are born with some ability like this.  There are entire musical traditions where this facility has been expanded and developed to a very high degree, however.  I can pay something like 350 distinct tunes from memory off the top of my head, well enough to perform in front of a festival crowd.  I probably have the ""stuck in my head"" impression of another 700 or so tunes.  I am not a prodigious talent in this way, however.  I know of traditional musicians who know something like 10,000 tunes, and 2 or 3 distinct versions of many of those.<p>I posit that musicians like <i>that</i> have a better appreciation of melody than I do.
