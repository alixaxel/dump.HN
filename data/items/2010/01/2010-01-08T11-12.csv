Yet there is no ""digital wallet"" service with broad enough acceptance to assume that your (or at least my) average customer will have one.<p>The chicken-and-egg problem seems to be a challenge: Sellers won't offer the digital wallet payment option if there aren't existing customers. Customers won't sign up for a digital wallet if there aren't sellers who use it.<p>Are you doing anything to address this side of the problem?",1262951702

Imagine you go to a shopping street, and there are crowds and stores everywhere.

The software highlights syntax and lets you check your code as many times as desired, as well as giving hints if your result isn't correct and providing compiler output.
