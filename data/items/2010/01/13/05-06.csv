1049542,comment,1049213,1049213,0,0,abalashov,,,"While I am glad the author has liberated himself from the emotional distress of cancer through blind optimism, he has shown himself to be a blithering ignoramus in matters oncological.<p>I certainly hope that his prognostications for 2030 carry a hint of truth, but they seem to suggest that one type of neoplasm in a single body of tissue is like another - e.g. all brain tumours are magically alike, treatable by the same means!  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is difficult to suppose that the treatment of such a thing is going to be a mere outpatient clinical procedure with a high success rate and few side effects.<p>It is precisely because cancers are a broad category of runaway cellular processes (united only by their invasiveness and lack of negative feedback into the growth process) that are highly distinct in every which way that the concept of a ""cure"" for ""cancer"" as such is an absurd one to anyone who has the slightest clue about how cancers operate.<p>It does seem that targeted therapy is the most successful avenue to pursue, but I don't think the author has any idea of the sheer amount of even the most common and relatively simple ""targets.""  I think he's imagining that there are a dozen, maybe two;  liver cancer is cured one way, brain cancer another way, retinal blastomas another way, prostate cancer yet another way... that's just not how it works.  Each one of those corpuses of tissue can develop many kinds of tumours, and some of them can develop practically innumerable kinds.<p>But hey, far it be from me to rain on anybody's parade - I'm not an oncologist, and have no life sciences background.  Let's hope I'm wrong viz. my opening sentence and that I'm just a pretentious, know-it-all twit, and that he's right.",1263361458

Real reporting is -- what have they done? What they've done is apply for status as a wholesale trader of energy so that they can get energy more cheaply.<p>Maybe they have good intentions with green energy, maybe they have good intentions in China. But it's easy to confuse their intentions and miss what actually has been done.<p>Though on the other hand, perhaps you're correct. Perhaps Google makes no claims to be 'humanitarian' or 'altruistic' etc. But by trying to pass the thing off as 'green' and 'carbon-neutral', it's easy to give them a free pass, i.e., some sort of unique status that will allow them to get energy more cheaply than everyone else.",1263361158

Not sure how many can be queued up and cached, but I've done two no problem.<p>Also, you'll want a task killer app, since you'll find that apps never ""go away"" until the system runs out of memory causing android to take over and kill some programs.  My favourite so far is ""Taskpanel"".  Additionally, for recording a GPS track, use ""My Tracks"" which is simple and enjoyable enough to use, lets you email the file to yourself when done.<p>""gpsstatus"" is fantastic - the must have for a tinkerer!  Also usable as a level, so no need to get one of the trillion level applications.<p>Believe it or not, the flashlight apps are very handy to have on the desktop, as they keep the phone from sleeping/dimming too soon.<p>HANDS DOWN the best application if you do any amount of texting or MMS, is 'handcent sms'.  It is a fantastic program, and one of the nicest Android programs I have used.  Can't praise this enough!<p>For twitter, 'twidroid' is my favourite.  I don't do too much twittering, so am not sure the competition, but this one is speedy, feature filled and never bogs down my phone.  You'll find that isn't always the case with android apps, so twidroid gets a nod for this (as well as handcent, it is rock solid).<p>If you use ampache at all, my buddy Kevin created an android app to stream from your ampache server.  It's called 'amdroid' and is pretty decent.  It's definitely a work in progress but it's fully functional.<p>'phonalyzer' is cool for seeing stats on your phone usage.  Much better than any carrier specific graph on a webpage, and it's small enough to not worry about having it installed and taking up space.  It's definitely what I call a ""toilet"" app, because that is about when I use it, however, it's nice to know my usage here and there!  I guess that is praise, because it means I don't have to spend hardly any time using the app to get benefits from it.<p>depending on the android version/carrier/handset manufacturer, you may want to install 'spare parts'.  It's a few more settings not found in the settings menu, but I think this only supplements handsets running android 1.5, but I am not sure off top of my head.<p>Finally, root your phone and install 'wireless tether for root users'.  I kid you not, it's the most useful app i've used.  You can't find it in the market, but a simple google search will get it for you, and you can just click the link from the android browser to install it.  It has access control lists, WEP (better than nothing) and multiple concurrent client support.  I love this application, but of course, use at your own risk as you have to root your phone to use it (not a problem for most handsets), and you may run up data charges fast if you don't have unlimited.<p>That's my main list, anything else has been tinkering.  These have been installed/reinstalled on my phone since I have had an Android device.",1263360481

That said, I like and admire a lot of what Googles does. And I think they have a lot of good intentions.<p>It's just that when you try to pass off your actions as humanitarian, when really that is not the whole story, it always comes back to bite you in the end (simply because any type of duplicity adds entropy into the system). Pulling out of China and missing those huge opportunities, financially and morally, is an example of something that might trip them up in the long run.",1263358997

This neither negates the good reasons nor washes away the bad ones, but nevertheless, we applaud because we approve of the action.<p>Besides, look around. How many companies would even pretend to do this for moral reasons? We've legally mandated moral cowardice in our corporations (by mandating that they must increase shareholder value above all else), and to see a company even pay lip service as a reason to something else is refreshing.<p>(Though if they don't follow through and either provide an uncensored feed or truly leave soon, it will just be lip service.)<p>Those who still say that Google's hardly an angel here, I refer you to my previous statement about how we've mandated moral cowardice; is it really a surprise that this step could only be taken in addition to other ""ulterior motives""? It would be illegal for Google to just pull out of a market because they were offended, and they could face shareholder lawsuits. In the end they must still believe this is a profitable move. (If only to contain losses caused by espionage...) But they have other options, ""suck it up"" being among them, so there is still at least a smidgen of courage here.",1263358857
