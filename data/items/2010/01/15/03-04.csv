1054202,comment,1052858,1053053,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>You haven't seen XCode, Delphi or MS Visual Studio, where, for example, you can jump to the definition of a symbol with ""one click""</i><p>I have used XCode, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.  Emacs' tag\nfunctionality is much easier to use than the equivalent functionality\nin those editors.  (""C-u M-."" and ""M-star"" are especially convenient.  And I would have typed an asterisk there, but news' parser is busted.)<p>The parentheses awareness he is talking about is paredit-mode, which\nchanges Emacs' usual keybindings from operations on lines to\noperations on S-expressions instead.  I never got the hang of it, but\nEmacs' built-in word/sentence/paragraph movement/editing functionality\nis essential.  I have not seen these features in other editors,\nincluding Vim.<p>The other feature that Emacs has over the ""visual"" editors that you\nmention is the ability to interactively change how the editor works.\n(This is especially nice if you're a lisp programmer, as there is\nnothing to be confused about; it's just Lisp.)  I am not just talking\nabout changing the colors or things like that, I am talking about\nwriting new modes, changing the built-in behavior, and so on.  I do\nthis so often I don't even consider it unnatural.<p>(Something I fixed today; when loading a "".chs"" file into the inferior\nGHCI buffer via C-c C-l, GHCI complains ""this is not haskell"", which\nis true.  Then it changes the prompt from ""My.Module>"" to "">"", which\nmakes the next C-c C-l command lock Emacs.  I debugged this by seeing\nwhich command C-c C-l ran by pressing ""C-h k C-c C-l"".  I then pressed\nENT to visit the source code for that function, and noticed that it is\nprogrammed to hang until it gets output from GHCI that matches a\nregex.  I changed the regex to something more liberal, hit C-M-x to\nload my changed function, and my problem was solved.  Those two\nminutes of distraction will save me much frustration over the course\nof the rest of my life.  When was the last time you fixed a bug in\nEclipse or Visual Studio in two minutes?)<p>But anyway, Emacs' functionality is not limited to Lisp.  I mostly\nwrite Perl and Haskell, and Emacs excels at both tasks.  It is also a\ngood mail reader, web browser, and IRC client.  (Why yes, I <i>am</i>\ncomposing this in Emacs.)<p><i>allow interactive step-by-step debugging with variable watch, disassembly, stack trace, etc - I shouldn't really name all the things that are possible in a typical modern IDE</i><p>But of course, no REPL.  I still don't know what a C++ programmer does\nwhen he wants to figure out what regexp he needs to match something.\nWrite a driver program around the library, compile it, debug it,\nrecompile it, and finally run it and play with it?  Sounds fun...<p><i>A compiler which doesn't ""enable very fast code"" has no place under\n the sun nowadays.</i><p>Apparently the real world is not under the sun.<p><i>Memory footprint: megabytes do matter because of the CPU cache. A 30,000 LOC program should take a few megabytes at most and fit a modern CPU cache entirely. Compared to a 50MB program the performance gain can be enormous.</i><p>Sure, but you have to realize that most applications that people build\nwith big stacks like CL or Java or C# or whatever are not really\nCPU-constrained; the context switches kill them.  (Wait for user to do\nsomething.  Wait for database results.  Wait to copy response buffer\nto web server.)<p>Nobody wants code that runs slowly, but the trade-offs to get\nsomething really fast (or to fit in the CPU cache, etc.) are not worth\nthe effort for most people.  ""80% solution"" and all that.  And, the\nCPU cache is all about critical sections, anyway; it's usually your\ndata that doesn't fit in cache and slows everything down.<p>So anyway, you are underestimating the capabilities of Emacs.",1263527439

1054185,comment,1053753,1053753,0,0,jerf,,,"What is math? There are many answers, so the one I pick for this post is that math consists of starting with some basic axioms, chosen to be as simple as possible, then rigorously exploring what else you can extract from your simple axioms by concrete proofs. It is staggering what you can get from simple axioms. It is staggering the subtly with which they can interact.<p>What is programming? It is the art of starting with very simple primitives, then rigorously building up slightly more complicated primitives, then building another layer on top of that, until eventually you get to a level where you can do actual work. It is staggering how far we get on how few primitives; it is incredibly educational to read what opcodes a processor actually implements. (Even better, make sure you read just the modern subset.) I mean, it pretty much just has ""move this here"", ""add this"", ""multiply this"", ""divide this"", and ""if this thingy is 0 jump there"". Yes, I know there's a few more, but the point is that it definitely doesn't have an opcode that downloads a webpage. It is staggering the subtle ways in which these things can interact.<p>It is absolutely possible in both the mathematical and programming cases to do ""real work"" without having the understanding of things that I refer to in my previous paragraphs. A web programmer does not constantly sit and do logic proofs, an accountant does not constantly refer to number theory throughout their day. Of course this is fine for the accountant, who is not expected to do original work in the field of accounting. (It is rather discouraged, in fact.) So of course it's OK for an accountant to have a very tool-like understanding of numbers. Are you, the programmer, expected to do no original work in the field of computing, such that you don't need to understand computing deeply? It may be so. Such jobs exist. But <i>watch out</i>, that means you're one library acquisition away from not having a job anymore! (And if you can't be replaced by a library, you're doing original work of some kind. Most programmers are.)<p>Look back at my first two paragraphs, where I have obviously drawn parallels. The real value of mathematics for a programmer is not that the programmer is likely to be sitting there doing matrices all day long, or even worrying much about logic problems, and they certainly aren't going to be sitting around all day doing sums. What mathematics provides is a clean place to learn the relationships I talk about, how we build the large concepts from the small concepts, and provides a playground where you can have that famous all-but-100% certainty that mathematicians like to go on about (justifiably so).<p>This is great practice for programming anything beyond a trivial project, where, if you have a clue, you will probably be starting with building up some reliable primitives, and then trying to build bigger things out of them. Bad programmers just start slopping concepts together with glue and just pour on more glue when they get in trouble, and produce what can only be described as, well, big piles of glue with no underlying order. A programmer who has become skilled in mathematics has at least a chance of producing something that is not merely a big pile of glue, and can have characteristics in their program that are characteristics that a big pile of glue can't have.<p>It is possible to come to this understanding without passing through formal mathematics, but it is much harder, because the world of programming is ultimately the world of engineering, and it is much harder to see these patterns. They are there, but they are obscured by the dirtyness of the real world.<p>That the mathematics may have an independent use is <i>gravy</i>; even if they were somehow otherwise worthless but programming was somehow unchanged (not really possible, but go with me here for the sake of argument) it would <i>still</i> be a worthwhile study. There are few better ways a programmer can spend their time than to become familiar with mathematics. Without the understanding of programming I outline above, regardless of which path you take to get there, your skillset will plateau, the maximum size or complexity of a system you can build without it coming apart will top out noticeably sooner than those who do have this understanding, and there will be things that remain forever a mystery to you. (Like how those large programs really work.)",1263526795

The principles of REST are why the web is a success, and so if we use REST, we can attain the same benefits.""<p>I don't think this is correct. REST piggybacks on the web's architecture, but I wouldn't say that the web is built on the REST philosophy, in part because REST postdates the web's initial growth. The web was a success almost in spite of itself, but REST wins by cherry-picking the good bits.<p>""If this is the case, is there any good example of REST?""<p>There is an interesting discussion of this and HATEOAS here: <a href=""http://www.suryasuravarapu.com/2009/03/restful-api-and-hateoas-conundrum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.suryasuravarapu.com/2009/03/restful-api-and-hateo...</a>. The examples given are Amazon S3 and the NetFlix API.<p>""The only examples I know of where HATEOAS is satisfied are HTML forms, as I mentioned, Atom feeds, and OpenSearchDescription.""<p>A plain GET link can be an embodiment of HATEOAS. Remember, it's <i>application</i> state, not <i>resource</i> state that's key here.<p>""I think HTML forms are a perfect example of REST, since they supply the client with all necessary information to build the next request, and URLs do not need to be constructed manually.""<p>Some are, some aren't. It depends what HTTP method you're using and what the server does with the request that makes it RESTful (or not). From that perspective, plain links are just as RESTful as forms - provided they're treated correctly.<p>""The way 302s are used to redirect to the newly-created resource makes web browsers behave more RESTfully, since they prevent reloads from resubmitting POST requests""<p>Preventing resubmissions is more about interface design than REST, though. From REST's point of view it's not wrong to repeat a POST. I'd argue that strictly speaking either a 201 or a 302 might be correct, depending on what you're POSTing.  If you've just POSTed to a collection URI, then a 201 response with a list of collection member resources would be just as correct as a 302 with the address of the newly created resource. The latter is more conventional, but as I say, that's a UI concern, not because one is more RESTful than the other. There are other ways to protect the server from resubmission problems, but they involve more work for the developer.<p>If you're PUTting, I'd argue that a 201 should always be correct, but given that browsers don't support PUTs directly anyway, that's not relevant here.<p>""All I'm trying to do is show that there are at least two codes, 201 and 302, that properly RESTful services might return, to support my argument that response codes are not uniform across all REST services.""<p>I hope I've shown that it's not in any way inconsistent to support both.",1263525141

This leads to 2 distinct advantages:<p>1) Elements inserted into a page after the script is initialized don't need to have events bound to them. (this is what defen was referencing)<p>2) You don't have to bind a callback to every single element.<p>The second can pay dividends even if there is no dynamically inserted content. For instance, lets say you have a table with 1000 cells and you want to make them editable when the user clicks on them.<p>Traditionally, you would do something like this:<p><pre><code>    $('td').click(function () { makeCellEditable(this); } );\n</code></pre>\nAlthough this would work, binding 1000 callbacks, one to each td element, will seriously impact browser performance.<p>With live events the syntax is very similar:<p><pre><code>    $('td').live('click', function () { makeCellEditable(this); } );\n</code></pre>\nThe difference is we've only bound 1 event, so the browser's performance will not be adversely affected.<p>Hope that helps.",1263524655
