Here is a short story from Tim Ferriss which sums this up where he realizes that a Mexican fisherman really has a very high quality of life.<p><a href=""http://www.peterbe.com/plog/the-4-hour-work-week-by-timothy-ferris"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.peterbe.com/plog/the-4-hour-work-week-by-timothy-...</a>",1262768053
1034412,comment,1033741,1034167,0,0,inffcs00,,,"I think you have to read the full paragraph.<p><i>""If you go back to the Pirahã language, and you look at the stories that they tell, you do find recursion. You find that ideas are built inside of other ideas, and one part of the story is subordinate to another part of the story. That's not part of the grammar per se, that's part of the way that they tell their stories. So my idea is that recursion is absolutely essential to the human brain, and it's a part of the fact that humans have larger brains than other species. In fact, one of the papers at the recursion conference was on recursion in other species, and it talked about how when deer look for food in the forest, they often use recursive strategies to map their way across the forest and back, and take little side paths that can be analyzed as recursive paths. So it's not clear, first of all that recursion is unique to humans, and it's certainly not clear that recursion is part of language as opposed to part of the brain's general processing.</i><p>He says Piraha doesn't have recursion and that he thinks recursion isn't essential to human languages (thus in contradiction with Chomsky theories), but that it's part of how the  brain processes information.",1262767895

1034410,comment,1034288,1034380,0,0,pierrefar,,,"First, get your stats right. The biggest oil producer in the world is Saudi Arabia but the next Arab country is ranked at number 8. The US is third biggest. These are 2007 rankings; reference: <a href=""http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/ene_oil_pro-energy-oil-production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/ene_oil_pro-energy-oil-pro...</a> . Oil is not produced in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, or Lebanon. Jordan was singled out by Jason in his comment on the blog and the others tend to be considered naughty countries in various ways. For example, travellers with Syrian or Lebanese nationality are two of the 14 countries dictated by the TSA recently to require full pat-down checks when traveling.<p>Another thing: the US imports oil mostly from Canada and Mexico. In the top 15, I see only 4 Arab countries at rankings 3, 6, 8, and 14. Reference: <a href=""http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/company_level_imports/current/import.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eia.doe.gov/pub/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publicatio...</a> . These are October 2009 numbers.<p>In short, oil being sold in the US being a vote to support despicable regimes in the Middle East is a stretch of the truth. Honestly, this is just what the mainstream thinking is, so I can't blame you for parrotting it.<p>Finally, I'd like to point out that your ""replace with Russians"" comment is still bigotry and it would not have passed without controversy.",1262767775
