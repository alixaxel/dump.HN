Ashoka’s Youth Venture and Young Impact, in partnership with a consortium of sponsors, announce the StartUp Scramble DC University Challenge taking place January 29-31st, 2010!<p>The StartUp Scramble™ DC University Challenge will bring 100+ entrepreneurial-minded college students from DC universities together in a weekend-long event to build and launch sustainable ventures that address social issues affecting local communities.<p>From Friday to Sunday evening—54 hours—teams of students organize to pitch, plan, and work tirelessly to launch socially-conscious businesses and organizations.  Participants deep-dive into an accelerated process of venture development over the course of an intense, two-day facilitated start-up experience. High-profile guest mentors, speakers, and panel members visit throughout the weekend, giving participating students the opportunity to network with potential investors, service providers, and employers.<p>Youth Venture and Young Impact are inviting aspiring social entrepreneurs from  over seven leading universities across the DC-Maryland-Virginia area to participate in the StartUp Scramble™:<p><pre><code>   1. American University
   2. Catholic University
   3. George Mason University
   4. Georgetown University
   5. Howard University
   6. The George Washington University
   7. University of the DC
   8. University of Maryland
</code></pre>
Students will return to their  campuses equipped with the platform, tools, knowledge, network, and motivation to sustain the momentum around advocacy and action that they began in the weekend Scramble.<p>The StartUp Scramble™ DC University Challenge concludes Sunday evening with teams pitching their ventures to a panel of expert judges. Winning teams will receive mentorship, up to $1,000 in seed funding, entry into a global network of Ashoka “changemakers,” and the possibility of one year of incubation services from Ashoka and its partners. Youth Venture will continue to work with the winning young social entrepreneurs intensively in the coming year to support their ventures, connecting the venture teams to StartUp Scramble™ sponsors for additional mentoring and engagement.",1262915919

My problem was that I wasn't sufficiently focused in one area; I tried to market myself as both a Systems Engineer and a Software Developer (which is common for start-up-prone types such as myself).  My biggest take-away from the interview process was that that was a bad idea.  I suggest that you focus on a particular area; web apps alone is still possibly not specific enough.  They'll perhaps want to know what specific technologies or facets of modern web apps you are into and proficient in.<p>Of course, that was then and this is now.

If that someone else doesn't take care of those issues then you end up having to solve them yourself.<p>And I've played enough with software raid that I know that configuring it to perform well is not a walk in the park, in fact I think it may be harder than getting a good hardware raid solution up and running on a dedicated box.<p>The nice thing of course of an EC2 setup is that once you've figured out how to do it you can do it again without much trouble.<p>As for the energy usage and the physical plant, that is entirely up to your way of using your servers. For instance I try to balance the quality of the service with the load on the servers to gracefully degrade the service when the load is at its peak (which is only a few hours per day anyway). That way I maximize my flat-rate payments on bandwidth and serverlease at a relatively small fraction of what it would cost me to get similar performance out of the various cloud suppliers offering. In a cloud environment those servers would be using just as much power and AC as they do today.<p>It takes me a little longer to get a server provisioned, on the order of 2 to 3 days, but that is 2 to 3 days, whether I order one, 10 or 100 servers. Very few businesses would ever need to grow faster than that.<p>Maybe my business is a lucky one in that it can make optimal use of a dedicated server setup but I see plenty of people choosing for a cloud based solution when if you run the numbers it makes very little sense.<p>The cloud comes in to its own if you have wildly fluctuating loads and/or jobs that need large numbers of machines for a relatively short period.<p>But for the majority of longer term high bandwidth uses I can't make the numbers work at all.",1262914506
