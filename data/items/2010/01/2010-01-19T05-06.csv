Here's the checklist, from the article:<p><pre><code>  (1) Wash hands with soap
  (2) Clean the patient’s skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic
  (3) Put sterile drapes over the entire patient
  (4) Wear a sterile mask, hat, gown, and gloves 
  (5) Put a sterile dressing over the catheter site once the line is in
