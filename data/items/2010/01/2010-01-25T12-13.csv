This doesn't make people steal the small store where they are not looking at you. That would make them thieves.<p>Pirates, though, don't feel like they are thieves, and that's the point, not the economics. They think 'if I copy this' that other person won't lose his copy' and 'I wouldn't have bought that if it wasn't available for free'. These are the rationalizations people do, not 'its cheaper stealing this and risking getting caught than buying it'. Most don't think 'stealing' and 'pirating' belong together.

They just can't see the problem with internet censorship, because TV, Movies, Newspapers and Games are all censored, and theer is some deplorable sites on the internet I think don't have any benefit to anyone.  Free speech always involves allowing people to say things you don't like or agree with, but ultimately the good outweighs the bad.<p>My line is (and will always be) that hidden censorship is the thin edge of the wedge for greater control, and that a faulty technology easily circumvented is pointless. I also have a large problem with any government of any kind telling me how my family should spend it's time, when there is no externality to the activity.  But the argument I had really opened my eyes to how the general public (and thus politicians) see this issue.  And because of this, I think the filter is coming whether we like it or not.

We started to settle and farm so we needed property rights. This was so your hunt didn't kill my dairy cow - disrupting both our milk and cheese nommage.<p>Intellectual property rights exist then to  ensure that society has a good supply of IP. Their success should be judged not on the moral value of you 'stealing' my 'work' but on how the copywrite and patent systems changes supply and demand curves from the baseline that would exist without the extra rules (and costs associated with those rules).<p>Remember it was not illigal for you to hunt my dairy cow because of how unfair that feels.

Well, does anyone truly believe they'd be music starved if they could only listen to the current back catalouge + what would be made for the kudos / enjoyment / profit from merch & performing? No chance. Music should be free, we have a VAST oversupply and there are ample incentives to keep people supplying it without authorized monopolies.<p>Books? Movies? Games? With these the cost of production is alot higher, the argument that people would do it for free still exists but it's less obvious how they could leverage resultant fame into some kind of money spinning live performance. I think here society needs to have the debate, but for it to be useful it MUST be framed in terms of supply, demand and what behaviour the system incentivieses.

However, the other 10% may not, and these are likely to be the large providers (Comcast cable modem customers, etc.) and will often set a TTL in their caching servers of 24hours minimum.<p>On top of that, most browsers also cache DNS information.<p>The best way, IMO, to get better than average availability on a budget is to put 2 haproxy servers at a colo provider that offers some geographic diversity, but can route IP traffic seamlessly between the two sites.  These kinds of places will often be BYOS, and charge by rackspace used.  Some bill in 1U increments, some you may have to get a 1/3 or 1/2 cabinet minimum.<p>Use the IP of the haproxy server as your ""public IP"", then configure haproxy to direct traffic to 1 or more budget hosting providers.<p>haproxy will generally handle all the session-management for something like an ecommerce site that requires a users connection go back to the same server each time.<p>It's been a couple of years since I was heavily involved in this, but you're looking at about $300/mo minimum in colo/hosting fees to get into something that can offer some resiliency against the common outage.<p>If a couple of hours of lost business have a value of more than $500, then you probably need to upgrade your infrastructure.",1264421290

Have two boxes with one company with a shared-IP setup so that if one goes down, the second just takes over.  Then have an off-site mirror with a different company and have my DNS TTLs set low enough that hopefully most people can get access in a couple hours.<p>The problem is that it all costs money.  Rather than one server, you now have three.  Costs have tripled to move you from, say, 99.5% reliability to 99.9%.  So, you're paying a lot more for a very marginal improvement and the question that you have to ask is whether that tiny marginal improvement warrants paying triple.  I think it's worth it - servers always seem to go down when I'm least available.  So, that's my 2 cents.",1264421201

A common point I hear from people who have problems with paypal is that although they have sent fax and spoken with real people, they can't re-abilitate their account. Another scaring thing is that most times (this is very common through ebay sellers, which I was one) is that they can keep your money! So imagine that you go live today and you sell 100 copies of your product for 30$ cad, and your account gets blocked and they keep your 3,000$, that's the reason I'd like to avoid dealing with them in the first place.",1264421186

They're the equivalent of thieves in this regard. If you're expecting lots of non-GBP income, this could become a significant cost of running the business. But they're very convenient and easy to link to UK bank accounts.<p>2. Don't get married to one provider. Use a ""meta"" API like Spreedly (<a href=""http://spreedly.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spreedly.com/</a> ) so that you can quickly/easily switch if something goes wrong. With all the ""PayPayl is evil"" stories of late, this is simply prudent. I haven't used Spreedly yet, but heard good things about them, and they answered a quick question I recently asked them.<p>3. Google Checkout is not as well-known as PayPal. Funny anecdote I can't find the reference for now: A website was using PayPal and thought to add Checkout, with both icons next to each other on the page. Their <i>Paypal</i> earnings shot up significantly, and Checkout got very little additional revenue.<p>4. If you accept credit cards for payment, ne careful with PCI compliance, even if you don't accept credit cards on your own servers: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Secu...</a> . If you process the CC info yourself, PCI compliance can be very expensive for a sole hacker or small business, so consider off-loading the processing to a provider. You'll still need to have some level of compliance as I understand it, but it's easier. IANAL so get proper advice from your lawyer and accountant type friends.<p>5. Taxes and HMRC.

So to say that H.264 is proprietary is actually correct.<p>On the other hand, H.264 is more open than Real Video, since you can get the specs of the format, an implementation is already available to you and the patents are currently reasonably licensed.<p>That said, the concerns of Mozilla are valid ... we could end up in the same situation as with GIF and MP3 ... although I don't think Theora has any chances to take over since it's technically inferior and H.264 is already accepted as a defacto standard (mostly because of Flash).",1264420868

I imagine it's very much the case that the few percentage of people who have a bad experience make up a far larger percentage of the people writing blog posts about PayPal. So it might be that 2% of people have bad experiences with PayPal, and 80% of them write it up on their blogs, while 98% of people haven't had any problems with PayPal but only 1% of them write about their great experience. So something like 60% of the things you read about PayPal will be negative.<p>All those figures are pure speculation, and PayPal may be absolutely terrible to work with, but I think it's worth bearing in mind.",1264420809
