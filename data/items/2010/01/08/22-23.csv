1040661,comment,1040517,1040563,0,0,hga,,,"Not so minor point: the California Three Strikes law requires the first two felonies to be ""violent"" or ""serious"".  From the reference I just checked, the only non-violent serious crimes are ""lewd or lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 years"" and providing hard drugs to minors (""heroin, cocaine, phencyclidine(PCP), or any methamphetamine-related drug"" or a precursor of the latter).<p>I find it impossible to work up any sympathy for someone who commits two such crimes and then shows he has no intention of staying on the right side of the law by committing any felony, violent or not.  I also don't see how it's bad public policy; as one person put it WRT  Giuliani's clean up of New York City: ""He found the root cause of crime, criminals.""",1262991545

1040636,comment,1040411,1040449,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I seriously doubt it, Paul. DVDs bought by consumers are saddled with extremely restrictive license terms. When Netflix or any other rental business buys DVDs, they don't just buy the same copy you and I do, but a rental version with different licensing terms which costs considerably more - I forget how much, but I think's around $80 per disc, though that's probably gone down somewhat. The content is (almost always) identical but the product code is different.<p>How can you provide a rental service to people during the 28-day DVD sales window without breaking the license terms? That's basically pay-per-view, and PPV is dead from the distributor's standpoint, there is almost no money in it now.<p>Part of the problem (for the distributors) is not that netflix rents to everyone, but that they don't charge any late fees. for years the video business made profit in 2 ways: new hit films that everyone wanted to watch but couldn't buy yet, and late fees - both of which subsidized all the other movies that didn't attract such a big audience but still took up shelf space. Well Netflix's business model depends on massive volume and warehousing, and it turns out consumers are willing to wait the 2-3 days required for postal transfer. And since there's no late fees, if there's a movie you really love you could just keep it out for a month and watch it 20 times until you're sick of it, whereas previously you'd rent it, go crazy about it, and then buy the DVD because that was much more economical than keeping it or wasting time at the video store waiting for it to go back on the shelf so you could rent it again.<p>So the problem is <i>not</i> that most movies are crap, because only a very small number of movies appeal to almost everybody; most people only like a narrow range of genres and actors and find others uninteresting. Furthermore, we've only been able to rent videos/DVDs for about a single generation; before that the only way to see great old movies was in art theaters and on TV. Now you can fit the 100 greatest movies of all time onto an IPod, goddamn. It's easy to be sniffy about what's on at the theater when you can hire a comfy chair for the price of a few lattes and pull a century of movie greats out of your pocket or laptop bag.<p>Obviously the answer is 'make something awesome' and people will throw money at you. But this is quite hard to do. I'm in the middle of making a somewhat awesome little movie right now (today is a day off) and we're doing it in a very hacker-ish way with a tiny budget in the 5 figure range. But in the movie business you can't iterate, you have to commit and ultimately we, the makers, only have our own feedback and critical skill to judge the project on while we're making it - so in startup terms, you are stuck with a very high burn rate, and you have to deliver a lot of (entertainment) functionality in your first release - you don't get to do a public beta, nor can you make any money by releasing a fabulous film that's only 5 minutes long. When people want to watch a movie, they're expecting 80 minutes minimum, and the bare minimum length of time/money to go from concept to delivery is 6 months and $25,000. You do hear bout people doing it for less...as part of a marketing campaign. No matter how passionate you are or how fast you work, writing, editing and shooting take up time during which you still need food, a place to sleep and a moderately fast computer. In short, we lie about these things in a desperate attempt to engage your attention :-)<p>If you begin with a decent-sized budget, then you can presell into overseas markets, but to do so you'll need famous names, which generally don't come cheap.<p>On any size budget, you also have to invest a lot in marketing (like 50-60% of said budget for optimal results) so you can open well in theaters, because for most films, the theatrical release <i>is not profitable</i>. You only hear about the big grossers - and in any case, the bulk of that money stays with the theater owner. Most films lose money or barely break even at the box office. The dirty secret of the movie business (for those thinking of getting into it) is that the theatrical release is just a giant advert for the DVD. You spend this huge amount of money on marketing in order to establish your film in the public mind as 'a real movie', and to provide a moment of recognition when they see your DVD available for rent or purchase - 'oh yeah, I never went to see that! What the hell, I'll watch it now'. It's incredibly hard to get people to even rent your film if they've never heard of it or seen an advert for it.<p>And all that goes times ten for getting people to <i>buy</i> it, which is where you have the potential to make some decent profit. If that isn't there, then investors are less likely to put money into films because the (significantly high) risk isn't justified by the (comparatively low) rental profits, unless the film is a relatively sure thing due to the combination of spectacle and star power - but as people often complain, such films tend toward the bland, with obvious stories and pg-13 ratings.<p>I have to say I'm rather with Warner Brothers on this one, and hope the other studios back them up. Partly because I can see benefits as a film consumer in studios having a more stable profit model, but also because as an indie filmmaker, a 28 day DVD sales window at least gives up-and-coming filmmakers a month to sit on shelves and be seen by consumers, who might later spend money on renting the film because the title is vaguely familiar from a previous visit to a store.<p>Excuse the rambling explanation. I just get irritated by people like this TechCrunch writer who have no idea wht goes into making and selling a film and seems to think they pop out of a machine like bubblegum.",1262990830

1040626,comment,1040411,1040580,0,0,akeefer,,,"Keep in mind that it's not <i>just</i> because of the studios:  it's also because of the various TV networks that the studios have signed exclusive re-broadcast deals with.  That's why Netflix sublicensed the Starz's rebroadcast rights, and why those movies rotate in and out of being available to play on demand (since the rebroadcast rights are all windowed to specific periods of time, with different broadcasters getting the rights at different points in time).<p>So it's all a very complicated problem.  Movies that already have the rebroadcast rights sold off would be tough without the sort of cross-licensing Netflix does with Starz; the studios don't really have further control until those deals expire, since they're legally-binding, exclusive contracts.  Rentals don't conflict with those exclusive rights, which is why the studios can license Amazon or iTunes to offer the movies for a fee, but can't license Netflix to stream them.<p>What they could do is to stop doing those sorts of exclusive deals, but those deals bring in a fair amount of money, so someone like Netflix would need to pony up enough cash on their end to make up for the loss of revenue that would come with either the total loss of those broadcast deals or with the loss of exclusivity on those broadcast deals.  But I'm sure that even renegotiating non-exclusive contracts to use in the future deals with existing broadcasters would take a pretty long time once they've decided to do it; those sorts of legal maneuverings take a long time.<p>So certainly the studios could start trying to do something about it, but it's not a simple problem that they could just change their minds about and make go away instantly.",1262990555

Start out just using one hash table.  When it gets too close to full, you allocate the bigger table and you start moving things to the larger one with each table access.  To check for membership in this state, you check both tables.  To add a new entry, you add to the larger table.  Once you are done, you can throw away the old table.

That's a pretty far reaching assumption you're making there.<p>In my view, the author did two things, and maybe this debate results from his rather rambling style that made it a little difficult to separate the two.<p>One thing he did was to explain theoretical properties of possible (bad) hash table implementations and hash functions. And the other thing he did was to claim that these bad implementations are actually out there.<p>I did not find a flaw in his theoretical analysis. Maybe there is one that you can find, but if you do you should be able to prove him wrong without any empirical evidence. His second claim that these issues frequently occur in the wild is where we do indeed need empirical evidence.<p>I don't believe that bad hash table implementations are widely used. They are very central components of programming languages and libraries and I suspect that any glaring mistakes would have been found.<p>But one thing I can say for sure is that bad hash functions exist in the wild. I know because I have written some of them. It's not trival to write a hash function that distributes hash values evenly across all buckets.

The reason tuition is increasing so rapidly in California is because the State no longer has the wherewithal to properly fund its educational institutions.  This is a direct consequence of the fact that Californians are able to vote on ballot initiatives obligating that state's government to take on, sometimes quite expensive, commitments.  Pair this with the fact that Californians have made increasing their tax burden exceedingly difficult, and you can see the Governor's problem.<p>That situation is really a mess.  Even for prisons, he can't cut spending below a certain amount, or the law enforcement brotherhoods and lobbyists will come after him.  He can't decrease the number of people in prison because of the Three Strikes ballot initiative, which obliges him to incarcerate large numbers of nonviolent offenders indefinitely.  And the worse part about it is that he needs to do both, decrease spending and the number of incarcerated people.<p>And that is one of what must be a large number of issues he needs to work through to get the budget on track.
