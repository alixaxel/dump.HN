Humans have been finding laws to apply for much of recorded history.

To cast this all away and try to parcel everything into microscopic localities which are not thematically related at all and thus discard what can be learned by taking a wider view.<p>That said, I'll check out the dappled universe idea, I've not come across it before.

Doing things like concave shapes with specific line drawing (especially if you want decent anti-aliasing) is complex and expensive, since OpenGL isn't particularly well suited for it.<p>Of course, on the DirectX side you have the DirectDraw vs Direct2D mess, not to mention that the APIs are very poorly designed (in my opinion, at least).  Doing 2D stuff in OpenGL isn't terrible, but it's certainly not well suited to it.  In most cases, something like SDL ends up being easier and rarely too much slower (well, unless you're scaling/rotating...).",1262930674

Rickover was a primary force behind the U.S. Nuclear Navy.  It makes an interesting read and compares academically created technology versus practical engineering.  Your milage may vary, but I enjoyed the paper a great deal.",1262930669

You can tell in the film that they are always on pins and needles about building schools, offering them medicine, whatever it takes to get the goods AND come off as the nice guys. These are not government operatives, they are corporate mercenaries and it's likely any over-the-top violent action would get their colonial charter pulled and their mineral license revoked by Earth-side government.<p>A little strip mining in a remote location is probably not going to get anyone excited. Ticking off the savages enough to get them to launch a full scale invasion is going to throw up a bunch of red flags for the Amnesty International of 2200. Nuke them from orbit would be off the chart unacceptable. Perhaps they were autonomous from earth enough to do it and then have severe repercussions after the fact, but it didn't really look like smashing home tree had much support from the ground staff at the first anyway. With the colonel dead who would push that button?",1262930628

The mindset of the author is firmly locked in the late-1990s, which was the height of the OpenGL vs. DirectX flamewars.  I'm amazed that he didn't bring up Fahrenheit. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_graphics_API"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_graphics_API</a>)<p>The accusations about Direct3D gaining dominance because of FUD or some other nefarious actions are pretty ridiculous.  Graphics APIs evolved rapidly during the period between 1998-2005, and there were times when Direct3D had a clear technology lead in certain areas.  I've never met a single graphics developer who switched away from OpenGL for any reason other than preferring to work with D3D.<p>However, the balance has stabilized in recent years, and the author of this article doesn't tell us anything useful about current technology.",1262930591
