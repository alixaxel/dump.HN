The implications are that pg's functions can take advantage of lexical scope, whereas McCarthy's original Lisp was dynamically scoped.  This will make a huge difference if you are so inclined to use pg's code to do some hardcore Lisp anthropology.  I did so a few years back using pg's code and it was a blast.  I then wrote a small Lisp runtime with dynamic scope (<a href=""http://github.com/fogus/lithp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/fogus/lithp</a>) to do the same exercise and it turned out to be a very different experience.

To live is to be separated from what we were in order to approach what we are going to be in the mysterious future. Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition. Man is the only being who knows he is alone, and the only one who seeks out another. His nature -- if that word can be used in reference to man, who has ""invented"" himself by saying ""No"" to nature -- consists in his longing to realize himself in another. Man is nostalgia and a search for communion. Therefore, when he is aware of himself he is aware of his lack of another, that is, of his solitude.<p>I recommend this old book.",1262396841

After all, isn't the shift to computer-driven learning simply a threshold between te utility / cost of supervised/semi-supervised learning vs unsupervised learning?  In other words, couldn't you say that at some point the 'ways we use humans' becomes too expensive vs non-human methods?

Americans like to feel safe, and up until about 2001 they felt pretty safe flying in a plane. Then in a vast, symbolic gesture, terrorists flew the planes into buildings. The American people's morale was so damaged by this gesture that we subsequently allowed our government to drag us into two wars that will do us no good and only harm in the long run. It will be exciting to find out what we allow or even demand it to do next time.<p>So yes, it is a much bigger threat than you're apparently aware. Or are you asking if the percentage chances of you being harmed are high? Probably not.
