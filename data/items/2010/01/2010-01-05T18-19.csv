They also replay hundreds of pro games for study, thereby memorizing them. I'd be surprised if it were any different for chess players.<p>In fact, even amateur low-dan -- advanced but far from professional level -- players can replay games they have played in the same day, and can memorize a few games with some practice.<p>Go games often last more than 200 moves but players memorize sequences, not isolated moves.<p>Pros can routinely read 50+ moves ahead but, as tsipiteri mentioned, the hardest part is evaluating the positions.<p>While there is no single ""world"" pro championship, a couple of Korean teenagers have won prestigious international titles. A 19-year-old who's ""merely"" a contender wouldn't be called a prodigy in the go world. I guess Asian go players just train more and are more competitive than chess players. Unlike Carlsen, they don't usually care about a life besides their game.",1262717980

This has become inefficient -- basically requiring us to write to the database on every page load.<p>Many people suggest using Memcached to store sessions but one of the core memcached developers recommends against that here: http://bit.ly/dZCT<p>Storing sessions in a cache is not really what they were designed for: caches can evict data, and if you only have one memcached instance, your sessions would be contending for space with the rest of your cached variables.<p>My question is: what do you use to store sessions on your high-traffic application where speed matters? What is the very best solution to this problem? What do places like Facebook do here?",1262715889
