I think the question is, should we make an attempt to select for positive qualities, or just accept almost completely random immigration.  I've read about Australia's points system, and I'd say it's a big improvement over the US's system.<p>I like Australia's system because it doesn't overly emphasize engineering or technology - sure, those are good attributes, but so is a background in nursing, medicine, plumbing, law, and so forth.  It also (appears to) preserves freedom for the immigrant.  I'd like to see any worker visa category in the US awarded directly to the immigrant, with no obligation to remain with the sponsoring employer.<p>But there's no real way around the point you're making - any attempt to select for ""excellence"" is going to make use of formal credentials, like university degrees, membership in the bar, possession of a plumbing license, and so forth... and this is a problem considering that people like Steve Jobs had none of these things.  So maybe some randomness would help.<p>The real problem, I think, is that the only truly free system would be unlimited mobility across national borders, which is a practical impossibility right now.  Any meaningful limits are going to leave some people who would have been good contributors out.",1262361368

Furthermore, the reason that it's the gravest threat is because a few terrorists ""have the ability to sway a populace to do irrational things"".<p>If so:  horse hockey.<p>As to the first part, a person's odds of being personally affected by terrorism are infinitesimal, especially if you don't live in NYC, Washington, LA, or San Fran.<p>Yes, it only takes a few terrorists to commit an attack.  But how we react to it is entirely up to us; they have no power to ""sway"" us into irrational acts--that has been purely the choice of our leaders and media, who have used the fear of terrorism as a way to build their own powerbase and advance their own agendas.

They scream blue murder, try to cartel up, but Google breaks the cartel and several big names are forced out of the market.<p>Ebooks defeat paper books. All high street bookstores go bust. Rampant book piracy throws the copyright war into overdrive. Despite international treaties and draconian law, the pirates win.<p>Electric cars become fairly common. A destructive feedback loop starts for gasoline fuel: lower demand, lower profit, vendors go bust, less availability, monopoly prices, lower desirability. The gasoline economy is brittle because it has high fixed costs, a complex supply chain, and its power source isn't fungible. As with film versus digital cameras, the result is an exponential crash in the desirability of gasoline cars, with mass conversion to battery-electric and collapse of the oil industry. Government greenhouse warming policies will continue to be useless, but they'll be eclipsed by events. The big panic will be the overstraining electricity grid. Residential grids were not specced to fuel everybody's car at once.<p>Driverless cars will appear. As they move down from the high end to the mainstream, they'll make taxis cheap enough that private car ownership starts to become quaint.

A lot of what I did amounted to churn and time-filling.  When I began working, I took an evening shift job because I knew that although I was healthier, I still wasn't healthy enough to cope with getting up early.  I now work dayshift, and that correlates to an ability to get up earlier because of improved health.<p>So if there is any correlation generally (not just for me) between health and schedule, then I would say that being an early bird may be a proxy for health but real productivity is rooted in sound health and the ability it provides to think clearly and do sustained work, which isn't specifically related to the hours you keep.",1262360518
