1038809,comment,1038080,1038775,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I think the use of ""management science"" in the title is problematic as management science is normally defined operations research or industrial engineering. Many of the techniques that you espouse, such as A/B testing, are examples of ""management science.""<p>I think what you are taking aim at that's ""non-transferrable general management"" is the bureaucracy of large organizations. Part of it goes back to the ""startup dollhouse fantasy"" which is a term you coined that I really like. But I think what you are ridiculing with it is the imposition of formal control structures on teams that are small enough that social process and peer pressure is an adequate substitute.<p>In ""Corporation Man"" Anthony Jay talks about 'hunting groups' or 'ten groups' having different rules from 'the camp' or the full tribe. Startups are like hunting groups, but every corporation has many ""hunting groups."" If you take a manager of a hunting group and put them in charge of a startup they will be right at home. General managers run the camp or the tribe and are less suitable for the special needs of the hunt.",1262923133

""Here’s how it would work: If you have a web-based business in California and collect revenue by showing out-of-state companies’ ads on your site, Bill AB178 will claim that both you and the businesses you advertise on your site have residence in California, and are therefore required to pay California sales tax. For example, say your Santa Monica-based web site shows banner ads for Amazon.com. With Bill AB178 in place, Amazon.com would be classified as a California-based business based on the fact that your business draws affiliate advertising sales revenue. Amazon would then be required to collect sales tax on all sales into California. The idea behind the bill is that California could force out-of-state retailers to collect and pay California sales taxes.""<p>You can also read more about it here: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468512"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=4...</a>",1262923114

It proved to be mostly right.<p>But in this day and age it is not so simple to control the flow of information. If China would be covered by a mesh wireless network then no single firewall is going to stop people from communicating.<p>In the former eastblock this was done slowly by Samizdat press, today that would probably be encrypted communications on wifi.<p>What will happen once those final barriers dissolve is anybodies guess, but that could be quite a while off.<p>Technically speaking the means have been in place since '95 or so, from what we can see that has not caused major upheavals. (the same goes for Iran, last year, in spite of a strong effort at it)<p>So I'm thinking that the same rules that apply to our society apply to the Chinese one, as long as the economy isn't doing too bad the people in power will be given more time, if there ever would be a major famine due to crop failure or some other 'act of God' then you can expect all kinds of trouble.",1262922923

1038796,comment,1038376,1038734,0,0,etherael,,,"They often go together, as you illustrate well with your comment, I agree that rote memorisation can be a bedrock foundation for any specialty, however it is not necessarily the only foundation. And the thread of my argument here is that it is not as good a foundation as a complete understanding of many topics in an interwoven fashion.<p>An attempt at an analogy; I assume you're familiar with jQuery as that's your nickname so I'll use that. One could memorise every single API method and syntactical quirk of the framework and be rightfully considered a specialist, but this does not innately suggest that they understand the absolute multitude of concepts that are likely to be bought together in a project making use of this specialty, or how the fabric of a jQuery object might be incorporated into a larger project using a full polyglot of development languages and spanning JRuby, Java, Groovy, Scheme, Scala etc. Knowing the underlying concepts that unite them gives a person the ability to solve problems in any one specific area potentially better than someone who had simply memorised all the API documentation for the jQuery framework.<p>Going through the rote memorisation of all these disparate things you're likely to eventually notice the patterns and ideas that they share, but in my opinion this is a backward way of doing things. Starting with patterns and ideas and fleshing out the specifics with reference documentation on a case by case basis has always been my preferred approach, it's much easier to find a base pattern and go through it's iterations than it is to simply memorise all the potential iterations of a given pattern. How easy is it to memorise a table of results on several thousand experiments demonstrating F=ma compared to simply applying F=ma several thousand times?<p>Even more so with something that moves as fast as development; when the framework changes and your memorised documentation needs to be updated, it is much easier to understand the change from the perspective of cause and effect rather than just ""here's how it was including all edge cases and implications, and here's how it is now, including all edge cases and implications.""",1262922764

I had read a great deal about obtaining the clearance and had help from my prospective employer that made the process much easier.  The best advice (as an earlier poster noted) is to tell the complete truth.  Leave nothing out, no matter how embarrassing, because the people doing the background checks and interviews will check out everything.  Also, make sure that you check your credit report and be aware of any criminal records that may be hanging around from your past.  Secret level checks go back seven to ten years, and top secret will be at least ten.  The security officer at your firm should be able to answer any and all questions you have.  I was told that interim approval would take 2 to 14 days and full approval could take up to 6 months.  With no criminal record or associations with foreign nationals, and a fair credit score my full approval happened within a month.  It can seem daunting, but the end result is worth the effort.

Explanations as to why these have lasted so long were uncertain, but researchers have made some pretty impressive speculations.<p>For example, viruses, in order to survive as a species, must not only feed of their host (the human), but must ensure that the human survives in order for it to keep living.  Furthermore, viruses compete with other viruses for food (the human), and so if another virus ourbreak occurs then the resident virus will, if you like, work with the human immune defence system to kill off the new intruding virus.  So they may have even been crucial to human survival at some point.<p>There were further discussions about how these ancient viruses may have affected human development (ie - the larger, tumour like brain, etc), but I can't remember much of it.<p>I guess the only concrete point I can contribute here is that this is definately nothing new.",1262921342

1038752,comment,1037810,1038580,0,0,sophacles,,,"So my understanding is limited, and only applies to the US as far as i know, but it goes something like this:<p>The power grid involves a few distinct parts -- generation, transmission, distribution. Distribution is the aspect most people ever deal with, its the ""last mile"" part.  Generation is self explanitory, and transmission is the high voltage lines between the generators and the distribution.<p>Some companies only do one aspect, some do 2 or all 3. The ""deregulation"" of the power market, was actually the creation a wholesale market of a commodity. This means that A generator operator in michigan can ""sell"" electricity to a utility in florida.  In reality, the electrons never get transported that of course.<p>The way the market works is -- Various generators place a bid on the market: x watts for y price/watt.  An official, neutral party aggregates all the distribution loads, and does some fancy analysis, and puts out an official number --  how many watt of power the peak draw will be for that period.  All bids are sorted, lowest price to highest price.  Like this (very very fake nubmers):<p>5W  $1/W<p>10W $2/W<p>3W  $3/W<p>In our example the peak draw is projected at 13W. Starting with the lowest bid and working up, the available power is used. in this case the first 2 bids. The highest bid under the line sets the price for power. So in this case power is sold at $2/W.  This is the price for the whole market, it is what wholesale power costs to distribution companies for that period.  The company that can provide 5W at $1/W makes a healthy profit.  The expensive company doesnt make any money, their electricity is unused.<p>The regulations keeping metering groups separate from the power market groups are there for market efficiency. First the generation only companies lose out. Second, if some companies had extra data, they could start playing with things, arranging for thier power bids to be raised/lowered in ways that are market inefficient. This enforces everyone to try to bid as low as possible to try to get their power sold at all.<p>So to answer your question: no it sets up the stage for price gouging on the power market.  the data is used intelligently for various long-term forecasting, efficency determinations, and for reporting to the markets, but the markets use the data intelligently for setting loads. Note, the data reported to the market by a utility is in effect statistical prediction, but the people who determine bid price for electricity never see this data. (people means algorithms here too).<p>I'm pretty free-market, but these regulations make sense, in the same way that insider trading regulations make sense, and regulation against monopolistic competition.  If it is not clear they are the same thing, it is more likely my explanation than the alternative.",1262921141
