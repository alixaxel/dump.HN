Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems more like a business decision (i.e. 'Not invented here' or ""We don't control it"") and/or license issue  (i.e. 'GPL is viral') . (I know that Steve was CEO of NeXT and brought that platform with him and that's what they used, but it wasn't <i>necessary</i> for them to do so.)",1264558002

They have no real interest in the freedom of their citizens or of other peoples.  Further, the government works primarily for the benefit of moneyed interests and has been thus since the founding of the republic.<p>These are statements that I think you would agree ""undermine the [US'] leaders.""  But we have the right to say them, and it is something we are very proud of.  Almost all countries claim to offer this right to their citizens, but the US actually does grant it and protect it.",1264557754
