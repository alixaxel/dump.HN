1039203,comment,1038889,1039180,0,0,daeken,,,"No, I certainly agree that cross-platform compatibility is important (the D3D10 implementation I mentioned in my post was for WinXP, OS X, and Linux, and spawned from a reimplementation of Win32 on OS X/Linux), but this has to be weighed against the costs.<p>Going with OpenGL, SDL, OpenAL, etc is certainly not the easy route, even with the huge benefits, and for small dev houses it can easily become overwhelming.  If your code needs to be cross platform, then OpenGL (or both, but that again is more expensive) is the only way to go.  If cross-platform compatibility would simply be icing on the cake, then you need to weigh the development costs of both approaches.",1262944440

I'm an OpenGL developer but I would dearly love to use Direct3D instead - Direct3D has a very nice API and is well supported on all graphics cards, while OpenGL is a mess of extensions and only works well on Nvidia GPUs (and maybe ATI).
