In my MSFE program we use XTrader to do a lot of our simulated trading.  I thought it would be interesting challenge to create a black box to bone up on my C# skills.<p>EDIT:  As for the GUI comment, I am actually trying to stay away from a bloated GUI as speed is key in this business.<p>Also, when we, as a program, went to Chicago during late October, so many people said that C# was becoming an important language to know if you plan on doing quant work.  Up until that point, I had been focused primarily on C and C++.  I thought it would be wise to do some work with C# if people at quant shops were telling me this is something I need to know.",1263005984

That makes those numbers special. φ is such a special number.<p>But there are a lot of special things about 3 though too: It's an integer (which is a pretty special property for a number to have, considering there are an infinite number of real numbers between each integer). What's more, it's a very small integer (the fourth smallest) and it's the second smallest prime number. In fact, we could say that 3 is a <i>very</i> special number, in the scheme of things, and has lots of reasons to show up in particular contexts.<p>Now φ being the golden ratio is pretty much all that's unique about it. Otherwise, it's just one of the uncountably infinite set of real numbers between 1 and 2. So if you find φ show up some place, almost surely you're dealing with the golden ratio.<p>The same is true of π. It's just some real number that happens to be the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. I've heard of mathematicians working on problems and having π appear in their calculations, and then suddenly realizing that they're working on a harmonics problem.<p>The fallacy of numerology is getting attracted to numbers that have lots of reasons to show up in various problems (usually small integers, like 3) and then taking whatever one of their many properties is most convenient and treating it as an iron link to whatever they're trying to prove.",1263005531
1040936,comment,1040759,1040759,0,0,timr,,,"The anecdote is a bit unfortunate (it's easy to confidently declare that someone is incompetent <i>after</i> they've made a huge mistake), but the point is basically valid:  a small percentage of people have good taste that should be trusted above all else.<p>The problem is that most people <i>don't</i> have good taste, and those people nearly always have an inflated estimation of their own discriminatory ability.  So at the end of the day, knowing that some teeny-tiny percentage of people is exceptionally gifted with good taste doesn't really help you much, because you can't reliably select for them in a group environment.  And in my experience, the people with <i>bad</i> taste are almost certain to dominate any discussion, just by virtue of their overwhelming number.<p>I think the real lesson here is just one of those sad facts of life:  if you work on a team that you haven't hand-selected, some of the people you work with are going to seem (or be) incompetent.  Traditionally unspoken corollary:  even if you selected the team, <i>you</i> might be incompetent.",1263005527

1040930,comment,1040856,1040873,0,0,wtallis,,,"Your two questions seem to imply that programming isn't that closely related to mathematics. Programming may not be that important for the math learned in school, but in general math researchers do at least as much programming as computer science researchers.<p>It is interesting to look at what languages get used for what kinds of research, and how it is affected by the researcher's level of computer science education. For example, those doing numerical analysis kind of research tend strongly toward MATLAB, with Python getting a lot of use from those who are relatively well-educated about computer science, and the lower-level languages used by people with extreme performance needs or who haven't learned any of the newer options. On the other hand, I doubt that any of the numerical researchers I work with have even heard of Haskell, and while some may have heard of APL (though definitely not J), none could use it.",1263005212

It's just not allowed. Now if the film industry's back is against the wall and they either make a case or lobby Congress to extend the same protection to movies, they can make two parallel arguments:<p>1. it's ridiculous and unfair that you should be able to prevent the rental of a movie's soundtrack on CD but not have the same control over the movie itself on DVD; and<p>2. while there is an explicit distinction between phonorecordgs and audiovisual works such as motion pictures (so that it can be argued the above simply does not apply), there exists a compulsory license for phonorecords - ie you can license a piece of published music for distribution whether or not the copyright holder wishes to sell it to you 
 - hence all those awful compilation records - but there is no such right for motion pictures, and thus a distributor of same is perfectly at liberty to refuse to sell to someone, and impose contractual conditions to that effect, which is the path that Universal appears to be taking (See s.115 of the copyright act). In short you don't have an automatic right to be able to obtain a copy.<p>Incidentally, since you work for Netflix, and I presume your presence here means you're probably programming for them, the main complaint that I hear from distributors about Netflix is opacity - they really want better metrics, of the kind Apple supplies to their content providers. They like the checks but find it very hard to track the performance of the individual films they distribute, which in turn frustrates producers.",1263003930
