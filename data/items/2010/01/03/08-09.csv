1028370,comment,1028314,1028314,0,0,loganfrederick,,,"The user cwan nailed the general failures of Japan's economic policy in the 90s, although the root of the problems extends farther back in time than even the Economist article covers.<p>Back in the 70s, Japan's rise as a world economic power was fueled by government loans to private industry, allowing banks to fund abnormally large investments in industries, specifically manufacturing and technology, which helped support the rise of the global Japanese brands (Honda, Sony, etc).<p>These same funds also helped inflate the massive real estate bubble the article briefly covers by selling the concept of the limited real estate space in Japan. What investors in Japanese real estate failed to realize is that even though there is a limited space in Japan, there is an unlimited price that a given piece of land may be valued at but a limited price that it can be intrinsically worth compared to the value of all other assets (hence the overinflated valuations of the properties).<p>For a long time (70s and 80s), Japanese companies made solid progress in commanding global sectors, and their auto companies still do. However, the loans became so large and the earnings generated by the firms eventually declined to levels where the loan payments could not be made. The subsequent bank write-offs on all assets were the cause and/or effect (really a self-perpetuating vicious cycle).<p>I cover these to give a positive spin on the United States situation. While the government has made a number of mistakes in regulating the banking industry and partially inflating the housing sector, it has not tried to directly inflate the economy to the scale the Japanese government did in the 70s. The United States government is propping up some American industries, but again, not to the extent of the Japanese government in the 90s. If that were the case, they absolutely would not have let Lehman Brothers fail. The government is in a tough position, trying to prevent political and economic chaos while allowing markets to reach their own equilibriums.<p>For anyone who fears the China may be catching the United States economy, there is a good amount of evidence that China may be suffering the same syndrome Japan had in the 70s (building its economy based on government money). China will likely deal with the problem more efficiently once a bust occurs, but it does mean that China could be less of a threat than many suspect, assuming the United States is able to innovate at a reasonable rate.<p>Here is a decent article/example of what I am talking about with China: <a href=""http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2009/09/09/petrochinas-sugar-daddy-gets-30-billion-for-takeovers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2009/09/09/petrochinas-sugar-d...</a>",1262508920

Or would it turn out that they do have <i>enough</i> in the way of concepts, and have only lacked the language to express it? Or does syntax play a greater role in intelligence than we'd thought - not fully whorf-sapir, but perhaps there is some contribution, in the way that going from regular to context-free languages makes a difference? (personally, I think most of the power of our language comes from a huge vocabulary and combining it in regular ways; the CFG aspect doesn't seem so to be so profound <i>in practice</i> to me)",1262508700

Yes, given a choice, it would be more efficient to use unskilled labour than a surgeon... but it would be better to have a surgeon doing it than having no one doing it.<p>In practice, I imagine his role as an advocate and organizer: a kind of charity-entrepreneur, and maybe leading by example, gandhi-style, rather than being an ordinary ditch digger. ""This is so important, that I can save more lives by doing it instead of doing surgery"". Of course, there are many problems with making infrastructure changes, cultural, practical, political; and maybe it needs special talents, skills, values and especially personality that even a highly intelligent, competent and committed surgeon may lack.

In her typical fashion, they are stated in a positive manner when really some of them have extremely negative consequences. But I guess these are the perks of being in the first fifty and having the king's ear.<p>1. Set a firm agenda.<p>It also helps to have and frequently exercise unilateral veto or green light power. It's a lot easier to hold meetings in which you don't have to build consensus or even explain your decisions to the people whose year's work you are killing after just having heard of it half an hour before.<p>2. Assign a note taker.<p>Sucks to be the engineer who gets this task. Maybe my brain needs a second channel where I can actually think about what's happening and one to take the notes with.

Carve out micro-meetings.<p>Once again, absolute power of the pen makes this a bit easier.<p>4. Hold office hours.<p>Nothing to complain about this one. Damn good idea. Wish I had the political capital to pull it off myself but it's hard to get people to buy into that when you are an IC. My workaround is to disappear from my desk a couple hours of each week to put my head down. Not as effective as ""You can only talk to me between three and five on Wednesday, and by the way sign up two weeks in advance before all the slots are booked out,"" but we work with what we've got.<p>5.

OK, I guess.<p>I'd also like to point out that none of these things happen in the vast majority of the meetings I attend. Normally it's agenda-free and the most senior person in charge wastes everyone's time by interrogating the tech lead about things that senior person should have read in the design document that was sent out the day before, and that besides that are higher resolution than the senior person rightly needs to know about, while everyone else sits around and checks email.

1028349,comment,1027549,1027549,0,0,emerose,,,"""The C Programming Language"", commonly referred to as just ""K&R"", is probably one of the best introductions to a programming language ever written.  It's short, clear, and concise — even today, 31 years after its first publication, it should be your first stop: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(boo...</a><p>As previous commenters have said, don't worry about the details early on.  Advanced pointer arithmetic tricks and the like are to C what zany metaprogramming tricks are to Ruby: dangerous, and almost always a bad idea — except in those few cases where they're exactly what you need.  For your first pass, you can ignore anything that's not obvious.  You probably won't need it anyway, and you'll pick the truly important things up with time…<p>Code on UNIX, preferably Linux, using CLang and a simple text editor to start.  The Windows APIs are just plain confusing for beginners, and OS X adds some wrinkles to the compilation process that it's better not to worry about in the beginning.  Linux isn't as austere as some of the BSDs, but that makes it an easier platform to learn on.  Similarly, while GCC is more common than CLang, CLang has a bunch of features — actually useful error messages, for example — that make it much much easier to deal with.  Fancy IDEs like XCode and Eclipse have their place, but are more complicated than they should be for ""hello, world""-type exploration.  All you really want is syntax highlighting…<p>Since it sounds like you're coming from Ruby, check out the FFI project: <a href=""http://github.com/ffi/ffi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ffi/ffi</a>  FFI makes it reasonably easy to call C from Ruby, meaning you can build scaffolding in a language you're comfortable with while you focus on particular bits of C code.  Similarly, it's not worth trying to learn the arcana of the C tool stack — make, autotools, etc — all at once, especially if you already know Rake.<p>Read other people's code.  It's probably better to stick to smaller projects at first, especially reasonably modern ones which haven't gone too far off the deep end with the optimization.  I don't have any great pointers here, unfortunately — the only thing that comes to mind is that (C) Python has some really nice, well-commented code and .txt files in its source tree, and that MRI Ruby is horrible.  The libev API also strikes me as a good example at the moment — but that's probably at least partially because I've been staring at it so much recently…<p>Once you're feeling reasonably literate, the next step is to read some algorithms and data structures books.  It's both a strength and a weakness of C that you essentially always end up implementing your own; even if you don't end up writing a lot of C code, getting a solid footing (or refresher course) in these will help make you a better programmer.  After that, you can probably read code with the best of them.  If you're still looking for more, I'd suggest maybe ""UNIX Network Programming"" by Stevens, Fenner, and Rudoff (a good introduction to the sockets API); or ""Modern Operating Systems"" by Tanenbaum … really, it just depends on what you're interested in.<p>-sq",1262506948
