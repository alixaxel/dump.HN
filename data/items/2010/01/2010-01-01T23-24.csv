That's usually applied to a situation where you have a small number of labeled points and a whole mass of unlabeled data; often the task is then to determine low density regions to define boundaries of natural clusters.<p>In Pandora's case, they have TONS of labeled data. All you'd need to do would be to run a decision tree (or a categorical-variable version of PCA) to (1) determine that many of those features are strongly statistically dependent and (2) reduce the number that need to be populated for any given song.<p>You could probably also do supervised learning on their massive sound database to infer lots of these features automatically (i.e. i bet you can pick out male vs. female vocalists without having someone listen to it).<p>Combining these (supervised learning on historical data + decision tree on historical data) would likely vastly increase their per-song labeling throughput.

(Wireless connection dropped me and when I reloaded the page it reposted.)  Unfortunately I can not delete it because someone has voted on it, and I can't flag my own post apparently.

Few words, almost no grammar and they still can stay perfectly in sync. If bot tries to imitate the style it descends in pure nonsense. If it does not it still seems like it's not capable of understanding anything.<p>I think another approach would be to ditch grammar and just build some kind of word and word combinations associative database fed with extensive memoirs of single person.<p>If bot spots a question it should respond with closest word combinations found in database. Also it should remember what was said and use it as a context while seeking for answer.",1262386905
