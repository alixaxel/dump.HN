1045440,comment,1045150,1045369,0,0,scott_s,,,"To quote a former President, it depends on what your definition of ""is"" is.<p>I think everyone here understands that we require information beyond the number itself to get the image. I agree that a more accurate (pedantic) verb is that a number can <i>store</i> or <i>represent</i> an image. That implies that the number alone is not sufficient to get the image.<p>The thing is that while <i>f</i> can be in theory anything, it will be one of few things in practice. We can say what <i>f</i> is very simply. While knowing <i>f</i> is important, it's also easy to the point of trivial, so some people here are comfortable being less accurate and just saying ""a number can be an image.""<p>This reminds me of philosophy of identity discussion me and a friend used to go through. He thought he could fit a Miata in his old-school Suburban - but maybe he'd have to take off the side mirrors. But if he's allowing the side mirrors to be taken off, then how much is too much before it's no longer a Miata?",1263229115

One of the categories is primes that have <i>no special form</i>, which are the hardest to prove prime.<p>Chris Caldwell, the primepages maintainer, called up Phil Carmody and said, ""Phil, if you can turn DeCSS into a 'general prime' that's big enough for the top 20 ever discovered, I'll be happy to host it on primepages."" (Just as he would host <i>any</i> prime, DeCSS or not, that was big enough for the top 20.) So Phil did, cuz he's a smart guy and had a lot of computrons, and the prime went in the database.<p>The point here is that if you're merely turning data into a number, you have no legitimate reason to distribute it other than whatever reason you had to distribute the data itself. However, primepages existed long before DeCSS became a problem, and was arguably simply doing what it always did, which is to list the top tens.<p>I don't know if that would hold up in court -- it was never tested -- but the argument is a lot more subtle than what people are criticizing here.<p>An aside: Phil and I worked together on some other primality records. I wrote most of that Wikipedia article back in 2002 or so, and they went and featured it.. this was all before the rules for citations/references on Wikipedia became tighter than a mouse's arsehole.

1045389,comment,1045150,1045307,0,0,jerf,,,"It is more proper to talk about the number + a decoding scheme. For given triple (image, image data, encoding scheme) any one can be held constant and the other two will have an infinite number of possibilities. In particular, any image can be represented as any set of data, plus an encoding scheme for that data. Trivial (but relevant) proof: The encoding scheme can simply hard code the image in question and trigger returning that image when it sees the held-constant image data.<p>You could choose to represent an image as image data + decoding scheme, using an agreed representation of the decoding scheme such as a computer program. Mathematically we get nowhere because we are simply moving the encoding scheme around, but in practice, since we possess concrete encoding schemes it means we can practically discuss the situation better.<p>This is a long-winded away of agreeing with you, BTW.",1263227912

Am I the one who's too <i>stupid</i> to explain things properly, or is everyone under the weather because it's Monday morning?<p>An image is a 2-dimensional array. Say it's a M x N array. Suppose we use RGB so that each pixel is represented by 3 bytes. Then you have an M x N x 3 array of bytes. There are infinitely many mappings from the space of all M x N x 3 arrays of bytes into the reals. Of course you can transform the array into a number. But you can do it in many, many ways. If you know what mapping was used, and if the mapping is invertible, then you can obtain the M x N x 3 array of bytes from the number. If you don't know what mapping was used, or if the mapping is non-invertible, then you can't obtain the M x N x 3 array from the number.<p>So, I claim that an image is <i>NOT</i> a number. I claim that an image is a pair (y,f), where y is a number, and f is an invertible mapping from the space of M x N x 3 arrays into the reals. You guys are looking at y, and forgetting f. That's why an image is not a number, the image is x = f^{-1} (y). In short, one must know f, and f^{-1} must exist.",1263227174

I have story about this which I can't resist telling.  It really annoyed me at the time, but with a few years distance I think it's both funny and illustrative of media stories about quantum computing.<p>In 2001, I was interviewed about quantum computing by a reporter (from the Sydney Morning Herald, if I recall correctly) who repeatedly asked me for a ""simple, concrete explanation"" of how quantum computers work.<p>If you take this request really (really!) literally, such an explanation probably isn't possible.  If it was, you could efficiently simulate the elements of the explanation on a conventional computer, and quantum computers would offer no real advantage over conventional computers.  In fact, in my opinion, what's interesting about quantum computing is precisely the gap between our ability to give such a simple, concrete explanation and what's really going on.  You _can_ give a (fairly) simple indirect explanation of how they work - simple if someone's comfortable with complex numbers and vectors - but it is pretty indirect.<p>I explained this to the reporter, who made all the right noises, and then gave him the ""simultaneously in all possible states"" explanation as an example of the kind of nonsense that sounds good, but actually obscures the truth of what's going on.<p>You can probably guess the rest: when the article came out, I was in there, quoted saying something along the lines of ""When a quantum computer is put to work on a problem, it considers all possible answer by simultaneously arranging...""<p>The problem is that this line is just too tempting and pat a story for reporters.  It creates the illusion of understanding (in my opinion), while leaving the more complex truth undisturbed.",1263227071

If I plug it in, it wakes back up effectively instantly.  (It doesn't offer the sleep period by default, but I think it can be configured to do so.)
