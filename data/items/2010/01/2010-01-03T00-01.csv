Saying that protocol buffers have a text format makes about as much sense as saying XML has a binary format.  Both are true, but it misses the point.<p>You can get pedantic about needing a spec for everything, but the web isn't really built that way.  Do you really track down the full docs for every API you interact with?  Say you are just pulling down some information from tumblr via their API or the like?  Probably not.. you just throw it in a browser a few times, pull out the fields you need and get on with it.  XML lets you do that, quickly and easily and most of the time will work just fine forever more.  XML is great for the same reasons HTML is great.

Often times people aren't interested in nailing down their API enough to 'officially' publish an interface.. XML makes it easy for you to use it anyways.<p>Parsing XML doesn't include lots and lots of code, at least not for me.  As I said, the amount of code to parse a Proto built class into my own datastructure is almost identical to me doing it from a DOM tree save for some type conversion.<p>The other plus is that proto buffers involve firing up those tools and incorporating them into your project.  How often do you just want something really simple, say the current temp in a zip code?

You'd be able to sign up for updates about parties, where your friends were, etc. and each SMS would cost around 20 cents. What made this work well was the fact that the overtaxed SMS is initiated by the server meaning that users that are signed up can receive a SMS and the 20 cents are immediately drawn from their mobile account. We had a a system set up so that people had to not only opt-in, but also accept a SMS when they signed up for this so that they wouldn't feel cheated. We had other things such as a monthly maximum, etc. set up to make sure everyone was OK with it.<p>As you'll quickly realise the fact that overtaxed SMS services are initiated from the server can be misused - get a bunch of random phone numbers and send them all a SMS that costs $10. Someone did this, and the law was quickly changed so that a load of back-and-forth SMS'es were required to make the payment go through.

1027925,comment,1027785,1027834,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"1. The structure of an unstrained free-market medical system is well-suited for rent-seeking rackets. Doctors and hospitals tend to be monopolies. Even with competition, few are <i>competent</i> at choose between competitors, etc. This situation has historically been restrained by modest regulation and by the fact that most people entering health care are motivated by the desire to help others. These restraints are <i>gone</i>.<p>2. The current situation is neither ""over regulation"" nor ""under regulation"". It is mis-regulation. But all the regulation or lack-of regulation in the world won't really prevent a determined group of racketeers/rent-seekers aiming for their <i>accustomed</i> level of sales and profits through their <i>monopoly position</i>. There just aren't enough honest dollars in health care to incentivize the currrent system into being efficient. Making the existing system ""work"" is akin buying La Cosa Nostra spreadsheets and hoping this will turn it into an honest business. Reform at this juncture is like saying ""can't you only restrain the <i>growth</i> in fraudulent loans just a bit"". When the housing bubble was high, even the growth couldn't be stopped. Now, the decay can't be hidden.<p>3. It's not ""The Doctors"" or ""the insurance companies"" or ""the hospitals"" that are the problem but all of these and none these. There are indeed ""good parts"" and ""bad parts"" in the drug, hospital, doctoring and insurance <i>industries</i>. But the ""bad parts"" are far to too adaptable for efforts at restraining them <i>piecemeal</i> to work. From the chart in the article, you'd have to deduce the parasitic parts of US health care get at least twice the sales of the parts needed for a sane health care system and quite possibly four or five times that.<p>4. The point is NOT how we will correct the excesses of the current health care system. The question is when the <i>growth</i> of the current excesses will reach the point when they are truly unsustainable. The current ""reform"" wave seems aimed to enlisting the state primarily in the task of squeezing more money out of those who weren't paying into the racket (the uninsured). Well, once they've run of people to squeeze and health care cost go from 20% to 30% of GDP, there won't be any further place for the cancer to go but down. I'm guessing that's five to ten more years. Will our economy last that long? We'll see.<p>5. There are free market solutions that could work and single-payer solutions that could work. It's shame we won't see either kind of sanity for a while.",1262478875

1027888,comment,1027785,1027844,0,0,carbocation,,,"Listening to just the Euro OBs seems no better or worse to me than just listening to the US OBs. I was initially going to suggest that you also speak with US OBs, but then realized that it's not really possible to just decide to do it one morning without purchasing expensive tickets, etc. But I do hope that you'll agree that the pitfalls of one-sidedness apply to both sides.<p>Regarding standardization, it does not seem to me to obviate the problem of comparison between unequals in this case. I know you are familiar with these concepts since you referenced them, but I will provide them for other readers; here are the WHO definitions relevant to neonatal mortality:<p>""The neonatal period commences at birth and ends 28 completed days after birth.<p>Live birth refers to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life - e.g. beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles - whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. Each product of such a birth is considered live born.""<p>The key is that live birth counts irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy. Viability begins around 23 weeks with extraordinary measures (give or take, depending on how aggressive your care may be). Depending on your approach, aggressive care may improve such statistics (if the care is aggressive only after live birth), or worsen such statistics (if aggressive care also occurs prior to live birth and includes things such as induction).<p>So (a) I think it's  actually quite a muddled issue, and (b) I could see aggressive care pushing these stats either way, depending on the timing and methodology of care. It's a legitimate issue that well-meaning people are interested in (in contrast to those who feel that family planning is a step away from forced abortions, who are simply ideologues).",1262476980

If companies can profit from selling pills to increase penis length, I see no reason why they wouldn't make other claims if they were legal.<p>I do not trust in the market to correct unverified claims; many people want to believe in miracle cures, and will buy snake oil despite others decrying it as such.",1262476897
