It is about the same as the new ""unsubsidized"" price for phone+data.  If I buy this phone, I will pay about $20 more per month for service and will be locked into paying it for two years.  This is still less than the price of the unsubsidized phone, of course, but I am still kinda annoyed that phone service keeps getting more expensive and only gradually getting faster and more widespread, despite all other kinds of tech getting cheaper and faster.",1262732338

Thus, prices won't trend towards the marginal cost.

It's ridiculous to make an investment without considering whether the market has already priced in the growth (in this case a quadrupling or quintupling of profit is already priced into the stock, assuming 15-20 as a standard P/E range, which might be too high for the current conditions).  I bought AMZN at $35 and sold at various points on its rise this year. I think it's currently overvalued, not like Salesforce (CRM) at 125 times earnings which is worth a short, but still high. As a shareholder in AMZN, you don't even get dividends.
