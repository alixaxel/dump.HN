Are placebos also effective when you know fully well that you take nothing more than a sugar pill? I don't think so.",1262689055

This means that the less efficient corn ethanol is cheaper than sugar cane ethanol.  Hmm, sounds like another corn product that's replaced sugar in the US.",1262688718

1032186,comment,1031540,1032143,0,0,DrJokepu,,,"That really depends on the query and the data structures used in the database. You can query large amounts of data on the hard drive very quickly if you store your data and indexes in data structures manually tuned for the problem. Modern operating systems / databases will try to use up your available RAM anyway to cache hard drive so keeping the whole database in RAM (if it fits into the RAM) won't help that much anyway.",1262688171
