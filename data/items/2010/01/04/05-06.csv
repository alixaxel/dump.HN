The suggestion being that the hallmark of ""animality"" is the ability to feel things.<p>In any case, I do not (intentionally) consume a great deal of Euglena, so I will content myself with pointing out that grains, vegetables, and fruit upon which I rely to replace the inhumane bounty of factory farming never bled, farted or blinked, and never will.

I've run it on thousands of lines of basic DSP code and gotten almost nothing--at best a single bad autovectorization.<p>The reasons ICC are better are many but unrelated to vectorization: one optimization I noticed is that it will compile a set of code that depends heavily on aliasing concerns twice and branch to which code path depending on whether the relevant pointers alias or not.  This branch is usually predictable, since the pointers in reality will probably never alias, but it has to abide by the C spec.<p>There's probably a few dozen more things like this that add up to make it a few percent better than GCC.

Jaron Lanier isn't buying it. In You Are Not a Gadget, the longtime tech guru/visionary/dreadlocked genius (and progenitor of virtual reality) argues the opposite: that unfettered--and anonymous--ability to comment results in cynical mob behavior, the shouting-down of reasoned argument, and the devaluation of individual accomplishment. Lanier traces the roots of today's Web 2.0 philosophies and architectures (e.g. he posits that Web anonymity is the result of '60s paranoia), persuasively documents their shortcomings, and provides alternate paths to ""locked-in"" paradigms. Though its strongly-stated opinions run against the bias of popular assumptions, You Are Not a Gadget is a manifesto, not a screed; Lanier seeks a useful, respectful dialogue about how we can shape technology to fit culture's needs, rather than the way technology currently shapes us.""<p>More stuff at the amazon page, eg an interview.

I do wonder whether for economists look at something like Walmart and see them doing more social good by making goods more affordable than XYZ charity (and arguably they do).  I think when most of us think of ""social good"" we tend to idealize not for profits more than for profits, but there shouldn't be any reason why profitability doesn't equate to social good - in fact, arguably it does given that revenues by definition require that people want a service/product enough to pay for it.",1262581595

The argument is not that there are more women Fields medalists from the UK; rather, it's that supposed 'innate' differences in mathematical aptitude between young men and women turn out to be not so innate at all.<p>To get Fields medal, it's not enough to be a brainiac.  You need someone to step up and give you a good mathematical education in your formative years, take your questions seriously when you're a more advanced student, and so on.<p>See the biographies of Sophie Germain or Rosamund Franklin if you want examples of how being the 'wrong' gender can hold back a first rate mind.",1262581550

Wishful thinking will not influence the direction that language, particularly English, goes.  The battle about whether or not to use an apostrophe before a trailing ""s"" is about four hundred years old.  The word ""ain't"", despite excessive pedantry, has been in regular use for at least 100 years.<p>And it doesn't help to try to fit Latin rules on English.
