11064324,comment,11056711,11064181,0,0,HarrietJones,,,"Well - Yes and No.<p>My view on this is you have both gender identity and gender expression. Gender identity is very important to people and (to a lesser degree, children), but it&#x27;s (mostly) invisible. We even hide our most obvious sexual characteristics.<p>For this and possibly other reasons, gender identifiers are important. It&#x27;s important that we (cis and trans both) can hold the magical tchotchke of womanhood and wave it about so that other people know what we are. If it wasn&#x27;t important that people knew what we are we wouldn&#x27;t spend a fortune on dresses and makeup.<p>How that gender identity is defined isn&#x27;t important. What is important is that it is defined. I&#x27;d argue that as long as it doesn&#x27;t impact on a persons life choices then  we should have things for boys and things for girls. So - Javascript is for Boys is a bad implementation of Gender Identity. Pink is for Girls is actually a great expression of Gender Identity. (As it doesn&#x27;t affect career, or ease of getting dressed or anything that may otherwise societally affect women).<p>Of course this whole conversation is full of mentalists shouting at each other, so we&#x27;re never going to be able to work out the best way of allowing gender fluidity in children or for trans people to live in the world without being labelled as mentally ill.",1455011958

Instead, it what would happen <i>after</i> that. The main two questions I would be interested in would be:<p>(1) do they scale to the size of, say, Twitter (~400M Daily Active Users, Facebook ~1B DAU)?\n(2) what would be their business model?<p>The thing is.. hypothetically GNUSocial is very nice. It&#x27;s free software, it&#x27;s an open protocol, you are supposedly in perfect control of your personal data. In theory, there&#x27;s no reason not to prefer it to the current state of things (if only you could make it appealing to your grandma or 14 years-old cousin).<p>However, when, for instance, the Justin Biebers, the Lady Gagas, the Obamas join it together with their hundreds of millions of followers, or simply when the tweets per minute reach hundreds of thousand or even millions, can the GNUSocial protocol ensure a reliable and responsive (~ real time) service? And if it does, what&#x27;s the maintenance and hardware cost for the confederations? And how are they supposed to financially cover for it?<p>Sure, there are services based on open protocols that have been extremely successful at scaling (e.g., email, or bittorrent), still, they have different requirements than a social network. Can we make an open social network of independent confederations scale? Probably yes, but whether GNUSocial is ready for it or not is an open question (as far as I know..).<p>In any case, take the example of the email. The protocol is open, there&#x27;s a &quot;confederation&quot; of independent providers taking part to it. It handles a massive amount of data every day. You don&#x27;t even have necessarily to store your data on a cloud server. That&#x27;s great.<p>Still, at the end of the day everyone uses free mail services (GMail, Yahoo, you name it), heavily maintained by hundreds/thousands of dedicated (and skilled, and expensive) engineers, storing gigabytes of your data (backed up and redundantly replicated over different geographical areas), and financing themselves using targeted advertising. Sure, you <i>can</i> pay your own, trusted, mail provider an annual fee and have (apparently?) complete control over your data. But how many people actually use these services outside of the work environment (where your employer actually covers the cost)? And I&#x27;m not talking about the community of hackernews readers.

11064136,comment,11060232,11060232,0,0,inaudible,,,"I&#x27;m a bit shocked that Conde Nast never bothered to work out a digital advertising strategy that worked. In the magazine business they can sell off their pages easily because they are essentially part of the content and their content is influential. They control the client pool and match advertisers with the brand of content, a reader of Vogue would spend as much time studying the content of some advertisers because it covered their interests in an interesting way.<p>A good friend is a fashion designer and she collects oodles of high end magazines, they have a heavy cover price and advertising makes up a large proportion of the pages, but it doesn&#x27;t matter because the content and advertising coalesce. The advertising editor is still an important part of the business and they make certain that their work both reinforces the business and doesn&#x27;t tarnish the content. It&#x27;s a slick alignment.<p>Something became unstuck with publishing on the web very early, and for whatever the reason, magazines and periodicals typically gave up exclusively collating and editing their own advertising material. An industry of third party providers took that job, providing the initial promise of instant revenue and later the promise that adverts could be tailored to the eyeballs of the viewer. But the third parties never came up with a way to nicely separate their ads from the content that people were attracted to, to give it the necessary space that makes reading a magazine somehow less bombarding. They adopted the messy format of banners and placement ads, which wasn&#x27;t far away from the newspaper grid. But newspapers were always a different beast with less refinement, the daily coverage was enough of a compulsion to readers that it covered the incongruous layout (and the trend for a very long time was not to pollute the front page with advertising as this would cheapen the status of important stories and editorials - this came much later). Every ad technology that they have come up with only aides in their own destruction - popups, overlays, flash and animated gifs only serve in distracting the audience enough to irritate.<p>It&#x27;s probably too late to reform the industry to make advertising consistent, relevant and non distracting. The content has already suffered, reputations are diminished and reputable journalists are becoming far more autonomous in their output. There was a renewed interest in digital magazine publishing when the ipad came out, it allowed for more traditional interaction, layout and perusal, but releasing an app based publication is more involved than publishing to the web once and there&#x27;s more mind share in the latter.<p>It&#x27;s going to be interesting to watch how the web trends for commercial media. But at the same time I doubt my fashion friend is about to stop buying magazines and judging by the content they are becoming more beautiful and textural with every new publication. Still a viable niche alternative to screen burn, the adverts look fantastic, and there&#x27;s zero chance of accidental malware. No salvation for a suffering industry, but they&#x27;ve been embedded in the web a very long time and failed pretty badly.",1455009686

(Just showing that I&#x27;ve read the book!)<p>The reason he was able to present this theory in a convincing way that advanced the state of the art in anthropology and sociology and religious studies, it seems to me, is that he was well-trained in the scientific method and scientific writing, so he was able to discuss it all on a scientific basis—that is, I suppose, separating the etic from the emic.<p>Again I&#x27;m simply curious about how the scientist in the article manages that... and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people get into psychedelics and then kind of lose their ability to talk clearly from a scientific, secular, non-mystic perspective.<p>Maybe you&#x27;ll see my point of view more clearly if I say that I have absolutely nothing against the mystic perspective—I just think the value of science lies in its refusal to really &quot;go native.&quot; And I think religious studies and religious psychology etc is more fascinating the more it sticks to the scientific/philosophical project of secular explanation.<p>My initial knee-jerk reaction was about a psychologist publishing a book with the title &quot;Sacred Knowledge.&quot; I am probably mistaken about this reaction... it was bolstered by the article&#x27;s quotes about &quot;sacred molecules&quot; and empirical proof of Jung and excitement about some guy who saw dancing gods on a drug trip, fractal patterns, and so on.<p>I&#x27;m super interested in how we could, with philosophical and scientific rigor, discuss whatever is the actual content of &quot;mystical consciousness.&quot; James&#x27;s work was an empirical and mostly anecdotal study of life-changing mystical experiences, and I thought it was very interesting.

I pretty much only use ST for Go because of habit and I&#x27;m sure in 6 months time I&#x27;d have gotten bored and switched again.<p>My point is that not everyones usage for ST to be as diverse as you suggest. So Sublime Text is still having to compete with other tailored editors as well as the general purpose ones.<p>> <i>windows only</i> ... <i>KDE, that is very niche compared to Windows, OSX</i><p>I don&#x27;t think that many people switch between Windows, OS X and Linux enough that they need a single cross-platform editor. For most people, an editor that &quot;just works&quot; on their preferred platform is all they need. So in that regard, Kate and Notepad++ are just as viable competitors to Sublime Text as Atom is; albeit the former two are only competitors on specific platforms.",1455009085

I guess this needs some clarification.<p>We&#x27;re a &quot;15 year old startup&quot; and we&#x27;re very active with serveral open source projects. Our decision to not open source the project at the early stages is a decision that serves certain goals for us and the project.<p>First of all, we see some interest in the technical foundation of eZing. We admit it, we don&#x27;t want to see a lot of forks and other people making profits based on our work while our initial investments are not covered. Yes, we&#x27;re selfish like that.<p>The second goal is that we want eZing to stay. Forever if possible. When we look at successful open source projects, we noticed that quite some of them have had a proprietary or at least a protected &quot;childhood&quot;. If open sourced at the right moment, a development community can take the momentum and relevance of the software and lead it to heights a single company is not able to. \nThere are two things that can go wrong: Open source it too early, before the technology is relevant or open source it too late, when the horse is already dead. The approach we choose is of course not a guarantee, but we believe in this approach.<p>Regarding the review and transparency: We are not willing to limit disclosure of the source code only to security companies or entities like that. We know that trust is not easily earned. If you allow us to dream, then we would - under NDA, see our first goal - disclose the code on a permanent basis to a group of developers that have earned the trust of the community until we finally release it as open source.<p>We&#x27;re thankful for your thoughts on this and we would be glad to further discuss solutions so we get eZing off the ground.",1455008538
