It may be progress, it may not be progress.<p>Progress depends entirely on what a person is progressing toward. Twelve hour days may be a better way to progress in a certain type of career than learning Haskell and yet learning-you-a-Haskell can still be a great good.<p>For me, there is an endless stream of programming stuff and computer science stuff that I might learn[including machine learning and Scala].

This means few dependencies. Part of what made Scala less accessible for me was it&#x27;s dependencies on the JVM, an IDE, and SBT when I participated in Odersky&#x27;s course on Coursera. Part of what made machine learning via Ng&#x27;s Coursera course difficult was catching up on the maths and the many parts of my life that matter more than learning machine learning.<p>My solution to the problem of too many shiny things to distract me has been to look at what I actually do and use: Linux, Emacs, and writing...and maybe some photography to get me out of the house. They are all low friction to slide in and out of. They are all about as easy as getting up from this chair and reaching for the camera on the desk. They also boundless space for scratching my curiosity.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t know if any of that helps and it&#x27;s more than enough about me, but one last thing...I&#x27;ve known Greg since about 1979 and he was giving me Vi when I mentioned Emacs and one of his comments was &quot;I know I&#x27;ll never be a programmer.&quot; But he&#x27;s playing his Strat on a stage in public more now than he did thirty years ago and happier doing so..and if that&#x27;s not progress it will do until progress shows up.<p>Good luck.",1454698704

Walk down a street filled with developers and you&#x27;ll run into many who know or have worked with Java.<p>2) Apache. Apache. Apache. The saying goes No one ever got fired for using Java / no one ever got fired for using apache. Most major apache projects and libraries are Java/JVM based and the Java interface provides the best way to interact with them. Don&#x27;t underestimate the pull from Apache on language choice.<p>3) Libraries - people have spent millions of man hours developing libraries for Java/JVM languages that aren&#x27;t replicated elsewhere. Odds are pretty good if you&#x27;re looking for an open source library that does X someone wrote it for the JVM.<p>4) Legacy Systems. Java is the new COBOL. There are billions of lines of Java code in existence chugging away around the world. It&#x27;s more expensive to overhaul and replace an entire code base than it is to find or train developers to work on it.<p>5) People are riffing on top of the JVM. Rather than fight it, all the new hot languages like Clojure, Scala, Groovy, etc. are building on top of the JVM and taking advantage of what it gives you under the hood and the fact that the JVM has a wide install base. This reduces the likelihood Java will die in many capacities since it&#x27;s being pushed into a more key infrastructure role rather than outright replaced.<p>Edit: fixed spelling",1454698473

Compare the experience with Microsoft IIS: the server automatically requests a renewal from AD CS, retrieves the new certificate, and begins using it.<p>- Tableau Server should be able to run as a Group Managed Service Account, so we can give it access to remote data sources without having to assign (and regularly change) yet another service account password.<p>- It would be helpful to have an scriptable installation process; as far as I can tell, there&#x27;s no way to install Tableau Server without clicking through wizards.",1454698101

If your service is in a high risk market or has high potential to cause damage then most all those things are really necessary.  If it is a small side project where you are sending some emails or doing things that are not mission critical to a businesses revenue then you are generally pretty safe (IMO) to launch prior to all these.<p>Reasons on both sides: Taxes get more complex when you have a company, but at the same time, if you do things outside a company and then need to transfer revenue and assets into a newly formed company it can be interesting to do it right.  Not setting up a company correctly can leave you vulnerable to liability, almost as badly as just running the business in your personal name so doing it right is important.  Get an accountant after you have enough revenue to worry about, sorry but adding an extra 10-50k of income isn&#x27;t worth worrying about getting an accountant immediately over, your normal tax accounting can take care of that.<p>I would however, always at least have a basic TOS & PP.  You can use one of the free online generators as they will at least get you all the basic clauses and then if/when things grow you can have it reviewed by an attorney and revised.  But this will help insulate and protect you quite a bit.<p>Generally, I have launched marketing, signups, limited trials etc all without having anything other then the TOS&PP.  Then if I see it actually has legs I get the corporation and banking setup and grow some more, then get an accountant, legal etc involved a little more down the road.

Or if you were building a Hospital (Lets say 5MW of power) and need to spec out 3-days of power (ie: 360 MWhrs of storage on 5MW Power), you just build a tank that can store a lot of the electrolyte.<p>I guess... the best way of putting it is that Lithium Ion batteries are like AAA batteries, while a Redox Flow battery could be configured as a larger D battery. D Batteries don&#x27;t give any more power or voltage than AAA batteries, but are more efficient for energy storage.<p>It is very easy to imagine how to build a 3000MW-hr 50MW Redox Flow battery (just build a huge storage tank). It is almost impossible to imagine the same with Lithium Ion (I guess you can build massive Li-Ion cells, but note that the Tesla is powered by tiny 3.7V 18650 cells wired up together. So it really hasn&#x27;t been done before)<p>Day/Night cycle storage is a low power (Megawatts) high-storage (Megawatt-hours) use case. Lithium Ion batteries are more useful for high-power / medium-storage situations (like frequency balancing, or maybe a couple hours-long storage).<p>Flywheels are exactly the opposite. They are high-power low-storage devices. Flywheels would be very useful for smoothing out power when birds / clouds come up in front of solar panels (for example). Its easy to build a 300MW flywheel with almost no capacity (only a few <i></i>minutes<i></i> of storage). Flywheels could be used when a power-source goes offline suddenly, while a few minutes need to be spent spinning up a new power-source. (ex: Main grid goes down, you need 30 seconds before your diesel generator fully turns on. The flywheel will keep very high-power for the next 2 minutes while things switch over). Although supercapacitors are also a promising technology for this problem.<p>Different storage technologies for different purposes.",1454696360

At a certain scale, companies want the lower cost and higher control associated with having their own merchant account.<p>Cost: Stripe&#x27;s 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction, if you do enough transactions per month, is very high.  How much better you can do depends on some variables like average transaction size, debit/credit mix, etc.  You can easily shave it down to around 1.9% in most cases, or better.  Again, at a certain scale, giving up 1% or more of your incoming revenue just isn&#x27;t smart.<p>Control: Lots of areas here. Removing &quot;STRIPE&quot; from the charge listing on the customer&#x27;s credit card statement. Direct control of chargebacks.  Routing to different payment gateways based on card type.  Better integration of card-present and online transactions.<p>You do, of course, lose the advantages that Stripe provides, so your scale would have to be such that replicating that functionality is justified.  There are solutions in the middle.  Authorize.net, for example, will let you use your own merchant account and pay just for the gateway services.

However the IRS/CRA have their own methods for calculating depreciation on these assets. The difference between these two amounts can create a deferred income tax liability or asset. That is, if you record depreciation higher than what the IRS calculates as, the income tax expense you record on your income statement will be higher than the amount you are actually charged.<p>There are also rules which identify whether or not companies can put a deferred tax asset on their balance sheet. Under International Accounting Standards (IFRS), companies must establish that they can realize these assets by having sufficient income to apply them against in the future. In the U.S., as was the case here, a valuation allowance was applied to decrease the asset as they indicated that they weren&#x27;t likely going to have a sufficient net income in future periods to apply that asset to tax expenses.<p>Anyways I&#x27;m a bit rough on it as while I&#x27;ve got an education in accounting it&#x27;s not my day-to-day job anymore.

I have heard excuses about not being given time to do it from the management many times before, but the fact is that you are the one who deals with the code, you need to make the decision. If you are not comfortable doing some change, you are the one who needs to be writing the tests or making sure you understand the code. It&#x27;s not some kind of separate task. It&#x27;s essential for doing your job right, so you should not expect extra time allocated for it.<p>Just adding your small change without touching the rest of the application is usually the easiest way, though, so most people just do that instead.<p>The best rule I have heard is to always leave any code you touch in a better state than you found it.",1454695490

11043268,comment,11032296,11032296,0,0,Almaviva,,,"For many decisions in programming, there are tradeoffs, and relying on general rules of thumb can be much worse than judging the specific case. And heuristics are often interpreted differently by different people.<p>Such is this discussion, imo. It&#x27;s very possible to over-abstract. If something isn&#x27;t extended, maybe it shouldn&#x27;t be designed to be extendable, and if it isn&#x27;t configured, maybe it shouldn&#x27;t be configurable.<p>On the other hand, abstractions are the heart of programming, and finding a good one is what can make you much more productive and maybe even have more fun. The feeling when I&#x27;ve abstracted something and got more out than I put in is maybe the best feeling there is in this craft.<p>The difficulty is in finding the balance. I also dislike the rule of 3 as a hard general rule. There are many times when it makes sense to abstract something out of 2 uses, if there is a lot of code and clear separation and commonality involved, or you anticipate more uses later. Maybe even abstracting sub-problems out of one case makes sense, if separating the problem cleanly into two parts makes it easier to reason about. There are many times when it&#x27;s a bad idea too; it depends on the specifics and it&#x27;s a judgement call based on experience.<p>(And, I would even say, there is room for personal taste in programming about this; where the sweet spot lies may vary from person to person.)",1454695264

I also think that it consolidates too much power in one place which is dangerous for the future and the secrecy is a big problem.<p>That said there is an obvious use for it in helping stop attacks and pretending there isn&#x27;t is weird to me.<p>> That line really highlighted the fallacy that &quot;mass surveillance is effective&quot; for me.<p>Specific evidence of success is likely to be classified.  It&#x27;s possible attacks have been stopped - the classification of information makes it hard to know either way.<p>Though mass collection can help, if you have intel of suspicious people you could look through the entire history of their communication - see what they&#x27;ve been saying and to whom. When you newly learn that a person is a part of ISIS (for example) you can look through their entire communication stream retroactively. Since the attackers are not always that sophisticated (they used SMS in Paris) you can potentially learn a lot of information by doing this (their network, maybe plans).<p>They&#x27;re posting videos of themselves on youtube showing off weapons and locations - I suspect there&#x27;s a lot of information available in their communication that&#x27;s useful for stopping attacks. It&#x27;s a tool you would obviously want if you had to do the job.<p>That said I think the secrecy is dangerous because it prevents the public from being able to determine what level we&#x27;d accept (and legal recourse against abuse). It also is more likely to encourage abuse and since James Clapper lied to congress about it we can&#x27;t trust the organizations that have tasked themselves to do it.<p>Thinking long-term, it took a long time to get relatively benign governments - consolidating this much power in one place (especially in secrecy) is something we probably shouldn&#x27;t do.",1454695206
