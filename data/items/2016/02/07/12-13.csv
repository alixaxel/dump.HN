11052682,comment,11047144,11052551,0,0,wscott,,,"I found the branch prediction claim to be a bit weak without perfmon data to support it. The references point out that the Intel &#x27;popcnt %r1, %r2&#x27; instruction has a false input dependency on the output variable and neither gcc nor clang seem to know about that and adjust register scheduling. This is usually caused because the chip uses the same scheduling bucket used for instructions like &#x27;add&#x27;. So putting &#x27;popcnt %rax, %rax&#x27; inside a tight loop will prevent that loop from being unrolled in the processor.

Like why do I need both `setup.cfg` and `setup.py` (this one bothers me the most if `setup.cfg` contains one or two keys)? Why can&#x27;t things like `.pylintrc`, `.coveragerc`, `.travis.yml`, `AUTHORS`, `CHANGELOG`, `CONTRIBUTING`, and `MANIFEST.in` go into a subfolder? I do like how e.g. flake8 just uses the `tox.ini` file for it&#x27;s settings. While I can understand why `.travis.yml` makes sense to be separate, `.coveragerc` is usually like 5 lines long.<p>`pbr` seems like a step in the right direction. But right now, it feels a lot like Linux/BSD/Unix, where every dot file used to go into `~/`. Happily, we&#x27;ve started putting stuff into `~/.config/$APPNAME`, which reduces the clutter and makes backups/restoring much easier (Which you can also do with git!

The surcharges are noticed because a lot of airlines have restructured ticket pricing to the point where the &#x27;base fare&#x27; is only 40-50% of ticket cost. One reason for this is that a lot of reward programs were restructured so that only the base fare is redeemed while the surcharges are paid (effectively devaluing frequent flyer miles)<p>But there is an even simpler reason why you likely weren&#x27;t being overcharged for fuel: you were flying Qatar airways. The new batch of airlines from the gulf states have been making huge losses in an attempt to buy market.<p>[1] <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=5918252"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=5918252</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/01/25/airlines-fuel-price-bets-not-always-paying-off/79288102/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2016/01/25/airlines...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/us-airlines-fuel-hedging-idUSKCN0RM0FN20150922"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-airlines-fuel-hedging-idUS...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-25/airlines-bet-on-long-oil-slump-after-millions-lost-to-hedging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-25/airlines-b...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://imgur.com/z874RuC.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/z874RuC.png</a>",1454849299

11052629,comment,11040283,11040283,0,0,chippy,,,"I worked for a British based airline for a couple of years (before the fuel surcharges were introduced). Regarding tickets, economy (coach) tickets are not where airlines make their money, so we probably shouldn&#x27;t look at the prices we pay for these tickets as data points relating to costs (fuel). It&#x27;s not comparable to train or bus travel.<p>They make any profits with business class and first class tickets. These are the seat prices which may reflect the costs to operate. Economy seats are there to fill up the plane. They can run the flight and still make a profit if all the business class and first class seats are taken and no economy seats are there. This is why the adverts you see on TV are never about the economy class, but all about the business / first class / luxury class. Airlines only compete with each other on these luxury seats, they don&#x27;t compete with economy seats.",1454847910
11052628,comment,11046704,11051462,0,0,vacri,,,"> <i>First they went after smoking, with that nonsense about plain packaging.</i><p>Plain packaging is nowhere near the first against smoking; it&#x27;s more like the start of the end-game for it. The government has been very open about wanting to get rid of smoking altogether, and has been so for decades. I was at high school in the late &#x27;80s and remember a bloke from Quit saying that they were funded by cigarette taxes, and his job was to put himself out of a job. Punitive taxes and advertising bans long predate plain packaging, as do bans on smoking in hospitality venues.<p>Alcohol isn&#x27;t going to go away any time soon for exactly the same reason negative gearing isn&#x27;t - too many pollies like it for themselves. Alcohol is also a major industry in Australia, unlike tobacco. Similarly, mainstream Australia identifies strongly with a tipple - for example, we like to boast that one of our PMs held a world record for skulling beer. I&#x27;ve never heard any such patriotic murmurings on the topic of tobacco.",1454847866

Having no relationship to some people who walk down the street occasionally is substantially different than actually having to be professionally associated with someone and practice tolerance on a regular basis. I&#x27;d also argue that free speech should be protected in both cases (socially if not legally).<p>> If your ideology is motivated by bigotry, that&#x27;s the problem.<p>I agree. I&#x27;m not sure corporate leaders need <i>legal</i> protection. Perhaps. But the right to publicly assemble and speak absolutely needs legal protection. That&#x27;s why I was trying to draw another analogy. To explore the difference between the Eich and Skokie incidents.",1454847723
