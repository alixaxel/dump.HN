I keep trying to convince my boss that this is the case, but I can&#x27;t find a study to back it up. My argument has always been that today&#x27;s UIs are generally not using 100% contrast, so people set up their screen brightness to match that - when you then come with 100% black on white, it is too extreme on these same screen settings.",1454907563

They also get to set rules for doctors with non-US training to be able to practice in the US.<p>The result is that the number of medical school slots has historically not remotely kept pace with population growth, while doctors from other countries face a pretty uphill battle unless they go to medical school in the US.  The net result is artificial limits on the number of doctors who graduate from medical school.<p>This has several effects, of which the most important are the insane hours demanded from medical residents (and all the errors they make as a result) and the high pay of doctors.  This last provides the incentive for the AMA to not increase the number of available medical school slots and leads to the observed differences in the income doctors get in the US and elsewhere.<p>Of course, in the wake of new rules to limit the insanity of medical resident hours the number of medical school slots in the US went up by 30% or so in the last 6 years.  We&#x27;ll see what that does to salaries going forward, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the effect will be downward salary pressure.",1454907226

11056391,comment,11047705,11056158,0,0,crimsonalucard,,,"You are talking about a lower bound. I can create a painting with a value equivalent to trash. I can take energy and throw it in the dumpster. This energy is wasted and therefore worthless. This is common sense.<p>But can I create a painting of infinite value? In the history of mankind... has there been an object of such immense value that society has deemed the object worth more than the value of all the lives of humans that have ever existed? No. By virtue of common sense no such product has existed. If no such product has existed then likely there must be a hard physical upper limit to value.<p>However, this example only hints at a fuzzy description of an upper bound to value. It is not clear what this upper bound exactly is...  because a human can use his imagination and say that a piece of paper is worth 2 billion dollars. If human thought has no limits and if human thought determines the value of all things, why don&#x27;t there exist objects that are worth 2 google gabillion dollars?<p>Let us develop a concrete definition for value with our first example: the painting. Also let us examine this painting in the hypothetical context  of an island bartering economy of two economic actors: a painter and a potato farmer.<p>The farmer creates products of concrete physical value: food. Food is a product made of energy extracted from the earth and the sun. The painter makes products of abstraction, a painting: an object supposedly worth more than the sum of its parts.<p>Let&#x27;s throw this economic simulation in motion. What is the maximum value of a painting produced by the artist? Can the potato farmer say that the painting is worth 10 trillion potatoes when his maximum potato production rate is 2 per day? No. This is impossible. No 10 trillion potato-painting transaction can take place in this economy because the amount of potatoes is limited to 20 per day. Thus in an economy of a farmer and artist the value of the painting is bounded by the total potatoes the farmer can produce.<p>Lets look at the absurd example of an economy with two economic actors of two painters. Both painters produce a painting and they both trade each other paintings. Then they starve to death because there are no potatoes to eat in the economy. This absurd example illustrates one thing: All economies cannot be made up of solely abstract products of overblown value. All economies must have concrete physical primitives like food an energy to function correctly otherwise people will starve or nothing can happen. An economy of pure abstraction is an economy made of hopes, dreams and imagination, such an economy cannot exist in reality.<p>So in conclusion what does this mean? It means two things:<p>1. All economies must have concrete physical products to function. Economies cannot be made up of only abstract paintings, poems and stories.<p>2. All abstract products within an economy are bounded by how much it can be paid for by the total amount of physical product in an economy.<p>Thus the conclusion is inescapable. THE VALUE OF ALL PRODUCTS PAINTINGS OR ANYTHING are bounded by PHYSICAL LAW and PHYSICAL LIMITS.<p>The notion that value is an ephemeral imaginative thing is an illusion. This makes sense in the context of the universe.",1454906955

Sometimes the actual signature content is visible as well.<p>Systems like these are absolutely necessary to help prevent breaches, as long as there are competent internal employees who can make full use of them. Perhaps an open source system will be a little bit better privacy-wise, on the off chance the proprietary solution you&#x27;re using is secretly doing something malicious or sending sensitive traffic elsewhere on the Internet, though if it were, the scandal would likely greatly harm or ruin the company.",1454905080

11056287,comment,11055741,11055741,0,0,miteinander,,,"This particular trope of equating romantic love and substance addiction is annoying and fundamentally confused. It doesn&#x27;t take neurology to understand that any activity from which we derive pleasure could, given the right circumstances or wrong attitudes, lead to a self-destructive spiral. And if one is aware that dopamine and other neurotransmitters are how pleasure is &quot;implemented&quot; in the brain, research which correlates a pleasurable experience with adaptive dopamine responses is pretty yawn-inducing.<p>Even if one doesn&#x27;t agree that the factual content of this research is boring, rather than salacious, I think the conclusions drawn here are vastly premature given our current understanding of the brain. Imagine that somebody with a tool to &quot;see&quot; electrical currents (an oscilloscope? CAT scan? I don&#x27;t know) was looking at my computer, first as I unleash a massive DDOS attack on some unsuspecting evildoers, and then as I put my latest philosophical writings on my ftp server for all my rabid fans. In both cases they&#x27;d see my NIC go crazy, working itself to death to blast out packets to either badly configured DNS servers or badly confused human beings (as it happens, these human being strongly resemble cocaine addicts when it comes to reading highly digressive rants composed by yours truly). So, is hosting an essay on an FTP server &quot;the same&quot; as initiating a DDOS? Yes, I suppose either one could fry my network adapter, but that&#x27;s pretty contingent. So, how exactly are they different, and what does this have to do with cocaine?<p>Restricting ourselves to what&#x27;s happening inside the computer, the differences reside atop a massive tower of abstraction. And what&#x27;s more, these differences put down shallow roots. Even with an understanding of the von neumann architechure generally or my intel chip in particular, most physical (&quot;neurological&quot;) measurements one could make would look pretty damn similar. One would have to understand the dynamic relationship between the cpu state register, my RAM chips, and my Hard Drive to even begin to grok what&#x27;s &quot;really&quot; going on. I think neuroscience is in a state analogous to that of a man measuring currents in a modern computer. Even if it turns out that in certain neurological ways love and cocaine are <i>completely identical</i>, it may turn out that the similarities are completely overshadowed by subtler states in a different subsystem. We don&#x27;t understand brain architecture, so who knows.<p>And really, the crux of the difference between the DDOS and rabid fans downloading my latest essay in beautiful LaTeX formatting has to do with the way the activity is situated in the relationship between me and the social world in which I exist. And the same is true of the difference between love and cocaine addiction. Courtship is a foundational human activity, one that profoundly shapes our cultural practices and understanding of ourselves. <i>Of course</i> it changes us! What the hell is meant by &quot;Normal Altered State?&quot; What is an &quot;unaltered&quot; human state? Being a human is <i>inherently</i> a state of profound embeddedness in a culture which originates in <i>others</i>. And another human being, who is also a rich and complex cultural creature, has immeasurably more to offer than the cruel, contentless, solipsistic chokehold of a drug addiction.<p>Take it from somebody who has both.",1454904746
