No appeals, automatic replies, and no phone number or support line.<p>I was making Amazon thousands of dollars/month in marketplace fees and they perma-banned me and destroyed my business in an instant.<p>Before this happened, I noticed that Amazon was using my sales analytics to compete and undercut any of my most profitable products.<p>I never found out why I was banned.  I had 100% feedback, fulfilled all returns quickly, and always answered customer questions.<p>The basic customer support I was able to contact told me that my banning was proprietary in nature and they couldn&#x27;t disclose any information about it and that any future messages related to this banning would be ignored/trashed.<p>My money was held for 120 days.

I ended up building my own AST to represent filters, and compiling to SQL. Every extra table join hurts performance - typically filters are implented as joins against a filtered sorted limited subquery returning ids, so fewer different table joins means less data to pull in when evaluating filters even when all the data is needed for the results page.<p>Point being, I had to compose complex dynamic queries and SQL was not a particularly pleasant target language to target directly.

I guess you are saying that we don&#x27;t know why it doesn&#x27;t just get stuck in local optimas?<p>I&#x27;m not certain, but for one, stochastic gradient descent is usually used, which helps break out of local optimas.

I was under the impression there was a mathematical explanation for both of those, though I haven&#x27;t done much research.<p>Off the top of my head, I think as you add infinite hidden units, a subset of them will fit the function exactly just by chance, and gradient descent will only increase their parameters. In fact as long as they are in some large possibility space of the correct solution, GD can move the parameters downhill to the optimal solution.

A lot of these current valuation numbers just don&#x27;t make sense.<p>The implied growth rates in many tech stocks is unrealistically high.<p>The Bay Area&#x27;s long-term employment prospects simply cannot support current home values or rental rates.<p>Once public and private equity valuations drop a lot of software development projects are going to get cut and with them the jobs of many software engineers.  Engineers who keep their jobs probably won&#x27;t experience pay cuts, but new hires are going to be expected to take much lower pay packages.<p>Why?  Because the talent is going to be available at lower pay rates.  So why pay more?<p>This is not necessarily a bad thing.  There&#x27;s a lot of irrationality in the tech business now and it&#x27;s crowding out the rational participants.  There needs to be a weeding out process.  It is good that it has begun.<p>Remember to think long-term.  Technology and the Bay Area are here to stay.  Let&#x27;s get the creative destruction process over with as quickly and painlessly as possible so that we can get on with making real innovations.",1454735016

In order for a deb or rpm package to install correctly, the binary would have to be built for musl already and the necessary information to set up services on the init system be provided. I don&#x27;t know how the latter works for other package managers, be it in a way compatible with OpenRC or not.<p>P.S. In my experience APK has been rock-solid and simple to use.",1454735012

To be able to write world-class kernel code (or projects like nginx) a programmer must posses at least practical knowledge of advanced data-structures and algorithms (including implementation details), machine architectures and automata theory (FSMs for protocols) - subjects about which typical PHP/JS coder have no idea.
