The problem is I don&#x27;t actually believe that this is the case for most experiments.<p>The smallpox vaccine was famously tested on a child. He was given the vaccine and then injected with smallpox. All based on a crazy theory. And the smallpox vaccine saved millions because of that test.<p>There are many similar examples from the early days of medicine. People just tested things when they needed to. The first anesthesia had only been tested on a dog, once, before being taken to the operating table.<p>Now hundreds of people die every year because we can&#x27;t test things quickly enough. Human testing is expensive, there are a ton of conditions that make it impossible in many cases, there aren&#x27;t enough subjects, we can&#x27;t release drugs if there is even the tiniest doubt they might not be safe or effective, etc.<p>Many lives could be saved if we applied a little utilitarianism.

Things we do:<p><pre><code>  - Load all if jQuery when we just need a few functions\n  - Load all of Bootstrap when we just need a grid system\n  - Load a whole templating library for one little widget (&quot;we&#x27;ll need more later&quot;)\n  - Load a whole icon don&#x27;t when we&#x27;re only using two of them\n  - Load a whiz bang carousel library when we only need to roatate a few images\n  - Use prefab themes that do all of these things and more (shudder, *parallax*) with the idea of providing nontechnical users with the ability to do anything they can imagine without learning to code a little bit\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think this is all incompetence (though plenty of it certainly is).

As a Python->Rubyist, it&#x27;s been really interesting to finally hit a functional language, and some of Elixir&#x27;s most basic features just seem crazy in comparison to what I&#x27;ve come from. Some neat examples:<p>* Pattern Matching. In other words- you don&#x27;t assign things to variables, you match things. Elixir/Erlang is just doing algebra behind the scenes. I&#x27;m sure this is a gross simplification, but it&#x27;s enabled me to write some really condensed code that still makes a bunch of sense.<p>* Streams. I know Node developers would laugh at this being a new concept, but I hit Streams when I was doing Node, and I didn&#x27;t get it. Streams in Elixir feel much more self-evident, and feel much easier to read.<p>* The Pipe Operator( |> ). This effectively lets you simplify code by just passing results from one thing to the next. For example(taken from the excellent &quot;Programming Elixir&quot; by Dave Thomas):<p>$ (1..10) |> Enum.map(&(&1*&1)) |> Enum.filter(&(&1 < 40))<p>=> [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36]<p>So there, it takes the 1..10 range, maps the squares of each element to an array, then filters the array to just the elements that are less than 40.<p>It&#x27;s a surprisingly enjoyable language to program in, and best of all coming from a Rubyist- the performance gains are automatic, especially once you grok some of Elixir&#x27;s crazier(but easy to understand) powers.<p>-----<p>The other thing I really like about it, is how friendly the community seems. I feel personally predisposed toward extremely friendly communities- Ember.js was the first community that made me feel like I had a home- and the care with which Jose Valim and the core team treat people, and the general &quot;Give back everything you can&quot; attitude of the community is really just inspiring.<p>My newest side project was something I dropped because I thought that the hardware necessary would make it not worth the effort of building it, but now I have complete confidence in it.<p>I encourage you to take a shot at it if you&#x27;re looking for a fast, functional language with a clear syntax and easymode concurrency.",1451655285

There may be a generalization of tic-tac-toe for n-dimensional boards that are hard to analyze, but that does not imply that tic-tac-toe is particularly hard to analyze (to be fair, tic-tac-toe is an example where one basically has to do an exhaustive search to show it is a draw)<p>A full analysis of go will have to include some <i>&quot;if N is less than X&quot;</i> clause for an X at least equal to 20, making it less beautiful, but I don&#x27;t see that as a big hindrance (and X need not be optimal in a proof for a 19x19 board)<p>In particular, the proof I know of (<a href=""http://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/gacs/courses/cs535/papers/Lichtenstein_Sipser_go.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.bu.edu/faculty/gacs/courses/cs535/papers/Licht...</a>) uses building blocks so large that you can, maybe, fit 2 on a 19x19 board.<p>Also, I think it is clear white doesn&#x27;t have a winning strategy, as black can pass at the start of the game.",1451654533

In my experience non-quantitative people (non STE-grads) tend not to be able to, at all, model decisions, decision trees and event trees as distributions or probabilities. This kind of decision analysis can be sold at very high margins, because it&#x27;s value can be very high for the right audience. Intuitively, if you can form a solid business team and do enterprise/policy/strategy level sales, a company around this has a market (none of the established competing software pointed out by others is very cheap, and none of it is very modern, accessible or intuitive). Another option, more suitable for a freelancer mindset (and with a wider distribution of non-bust outcomes as well as arguably higher EV...), is starting and maintaining this as an OSS project, hopefully with a wide and growing contributor base; and establishing a  career as a consultant in the modelling/predictions space with Guesstimate as your resume and business card.

Speaking of, Rearden actually offers to give ten thousand dollars to his brother&#x27;s charity...and is chastised for it by his brother, who complains that Rearden isn&#x27;t a true believer, and then demands that the money be delivered in cash so as to not besmirch the charity with a greedy capitalist&#x27;s name. While Rearden was not giving for the charity&#x27;s sake so much as he was giving for his brother&#x27;s sake, it&#x27;s hard to argue that giving ten thousand dollars to make your brother happy is a &quot;selfish&quot; thing to do.<p>Allowing people to trump others is presented as good only in the sense that competition encourages improvement. It&#x27;s not that you&#x27;ve beaten someone, it&#x27;s that you did so by creating a better metal, or engine, or or or. By letting one man&#x27;s (better) design become more successful, even at the expense of another man&#x27;s design, you encourage better design overall. Recall the bright young engineer who made an exceptionally efficient diesel engine, and was worked to the bone for 12 hours a day in response. Were he given a raise instead, others would have found that innovation is rewarded. If the ones who do not make new, better engines are given the same money for less value, then why should anyone make new engines?<p>As for the problem of the great minds versus the small ones, that&#x27;s where Rand falls flat. She is right on the money re: value and rewarding it, but she fails to consider that the people who have great ideas are a fairly small group, and that the people on the assembly line are still worth rewarding for other kinds of hard work.<p>I only know that Rand came to the USA in the midst of the cold war, which explains why she&#x27;a so upset over commies.",1451654301
