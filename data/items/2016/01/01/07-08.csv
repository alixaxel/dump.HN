This means you&#x27;ll be able to get up and running quickly but your code will not have the same nuances. Look for coding standards used at big companies. I believe Google has one that&#x27;s publicly available. Epic Games also has one for UE4. Hopefully they should have some explanation for the choices they made. If not, do some googling of the relevant areas and see if you can figure out why they chose what they did. Spend some time reading code. GitHub has lots of repositories you can check out.<p>For books you won&#x27;t do badly if you pick up anything by Scott Meyers or Herb Sutter. They also both have good blogs. Meyers&#x27;s books tend to be broken down into about fifty main points with discussion on each. I like to use them by reading one point and then trying to apply it specifically in my work. Doing this at one point a week I can go through about a book a year. C++ Coding Standards by Sutter and Alexandrescu or Effective C++ would be my top two recommendations for someone with your background. I&#x27;d stay away from Alexandrescu&#x27;s other work for now since it tends to be more advanced and potentially dangerous.<p>YouTube videos of talks by any of the authors I mentioned may also be useful to you.<p>You specifically mentioned memory management and concurrency so I&#x27;ll throw in some specific advice for them. Modern C++ uses smart pointers for dynamic memory. If you&#x27;re allocating dynamic memory and not using a smart pointer you&#x27;re almost certainly doing something wrong. If you want to get into really low level stuff with memory management look at how malloc or new are implemented and do a search for &quot;small block allocator&quot;. For concurrency your best bet is probably to find resources devoted to threading and asynchronous execution. I haven&#x27;t looked into that in a while so I don&#x27;t have specific recommendations for good resources.",1451635020

It reflects not just directly on the product but on the team dynamics.<p>I have seen this happen at least twice in the past: start with a great team, smart people, self-sufficient. New manager comes in. What does the manager do? Stay by and watch the team do what they do best. Nope, start to set up meetings to improve communication, to streamline, to optimize, adds new rules , new Kanbans, some agile thing maybe, intensify devops a bit.  &quot;But why? it doesn&#x27;t make sensse&quot;.  Developers are wondering, watching their motivation and productivity get sucked out.<p>But it does make sense. The manager has a manager. When the end of the year comes, they&#x27;ll have to report &quot;I did X, implemented Y, facilitated Z etc&quot;.

10821367,comment,10820445,10820833,0,0,otakucode,,,"That reminds me of the story which I believe was posted on here (might&#x27;ve been somewhere else) a year or two back about LG TVs and their interface everybody loves - it was a total accident.  LG had (might still have, dunno) a program in place where managers got a bonus for every feature they spearheaded which shipped in a product... this resulted in managers from many different teams shoehorning in whatever they could into the &#x27;Smart TV&#x27; interface.  There were 2 separate &#x27;app stores&#x27;, multiple inconsistent interfaces, it was slow as molasses, etc.  LG acquired the WebOS team and they adapted WebOS to the LG sets just as an experiment... but someone took one of the TVs they had it running on to a trade show... and everybody absolutely loved it because it was simple, direct, uncluttered, and fast.  It caused LG a huge problem because it clashed with their corporate policy that encouraged the other bloated interface.<p>I honestly think that a lot of companies should seriously re-evaluate how they function.  Once a product is perfected, the developers should probably be switched over to being paid &quot;on retainer&quot;, so that they continue to get paid but do not have to go into work constantly and maintain a 40 hour work week.  Let them work from home, and just require them to be reachable.  When maintenance is needed, ping them to do it.",1451634232

Voting is where the &quot;free&quot; comes from in &quot;free&quot; society.  If we are controlled or very significantly pressured to vote in ways the power likes, does that not only serve the power?<p>Of course it does, which is why we don&#x27;t do it.<p>Speech is different.

They tend to own things and when they own them, they tend to exert control over them, and that impacts us.<p>If we elect a bad leader, we can debate that, vote and try again.<p>The key here is we know who holds the power.<p>When it&#x27;s anonymous money and proxies, we don&#x27;t know anything really.

If somebody spends a few hundred million large on gay or minority or woman hostile advocacy, all of those people impacted can and should respond in like kind.  This is going to limit the kinds of things people spend on, and those limits are appropriate checks on what is otherwise a lot of raw power.<p>In the same vein, someone dropping a few hundred million large on STEM policy advocacy to make the nation compete better, all of those people impacted need to respond in like kind too.  It may be a good response, or maybe the STEM advocacy is harmful somehow.  Whatever the case.<p>The major difference is money being used to lead people, set policy, do advocacy, etc...<p>Proponents of Citizens United made a basic market of ideas and freedom argument.  Great!  That&#x27;s what they got too, and we&#x27;ve seen it play out for a while now.<p>Many of us are not impressed with the outcome.

The single page web app has a long loading time, looking with DevTools it turned out it&#x27;s a GWT+Ember ugly monster, that was slapped onto their old rusty Eclipse based Java product. The little information they can show is shown on a 7-times nested navigation page structure so they can advertise it as &quot;drill down&quot; whereas competitors show all info on a maximum of 2-3 times nested pages, and most info is visible without a single click. And the bad one is very much into enterprise with a huge sales stuff, the better competitor is a SaaS-only company.",1451632800

I know trails is supposed to have a pack that allows you to use it with current sails codebases, how well baked do you expect that to be? Will anything in the sails codebase that goes beyond the simple controllers, models, services, config need to be refactored?

Than the bloat came, and nowadays Windows 10 looks more blant and has reduced UI than ever and still requires and runs as slow as Windows 7 which had a lot of themes and transparent effects and a rather modern and nice interface. No wonder several parts of the interface like the startmenu are now in dotNet. It was already a major mistake that lead to the restart of the Longhorn project which became Vista - the former dotNet based Explorer and shell and WinFS all were dotNet applications and very slow. I run WinFS beta 2 on WinXP on an high end PC at that time and it was promising but aweful slow. Instead of adding the database-like features to NTFS driver (parts of the object features from Cairo project are still there), they added an filesystem filter driver in userland and a dotNet service. Needless to say that idiotic design and relying on dotNet for a mission critical component never worked out. Vista shipped with an improved WinXP desktop search.",1451632653

Being shaven means the soldiers have both the resources and time necessary to attend their hygiene.  A lack of hygiene is often far more dangerous than combat [1].   Shaving is also something many young soldiers do not feel strictly necessary.  They do it because they are told so to do.  Therefore it is a mark of some basic discipline.<p>Look at historic pictures of soldiers under continuous stress.
