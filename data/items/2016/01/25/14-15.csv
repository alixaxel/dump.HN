Government agencies spend trillions of dollars each year on helping the poor, the old, and the disabled in various ways.  They do so in ways that are fantastically accountable (compared to the private sector), including but not limited to the fact that basically any document about anything written by anyone working at these agencies can be requested by a member of the public and the government must give them a copy.  The executives working at government agencies are paid frugally, their books are audited regularly, and they are subject to dismissal for even minor transgressions.<p>Total charitable giving in the U.S. is an order of magnitude lower (even assuming that every cent was spent on something good, which is far from the truth), their accountability consists of (at most) a mandatory report every year and nothing else (often not even that), and their executives are now hitting 7-figure salaries.<p>It&#x27;s not even close.",1453733957

I was its fifth employee, and later a consultant. I handled architecture, design, implementation, and debugging of Sun Workstations. Wrote and maintained bootstrap and diagnostic ROMs for the Sun-1, Sun-2, and Sun-3. Debugged first prototypes of Sun-1 and Sun-2, working with the hardware designer. Worked on first bringup ever of Unix on Motorola 68010 and 68020. Designed and diagnosed the chip designs for the SPARCstation-1 and SPARCstation-2. Straddled the hardware and software camps to locate, explain, and solve design, implementation, and manufacturing problems. Pulled many chestnuts out of fires. Debugged Unix utilities, kernel, device drivers, and CAD software. Diagnostics. Documentation. Electronic mail maintenance, support, and enhancement. Performance and code generation improvement.

The Tesla warranty is 8 years but the batteries will last significantly longer they will just have less than 80% of max storage (I believe that is the warranty threshold).<p>The tesla powertrain as a whole should last a million miles or maybe more with nothing more than routine maintenance and some battery pack changes which will drop in cost over time. If battery pack changes get down to $5K (which seems very possible), and battery packs are usable for let&#x27;s say 150K miles, then you get a car with a power train that runs for a million miles for about $45K in maintenance (add a bit more for tires and other incidentals) and then subtract the cheaper electric fuel cost. This is less than the cost to keep the power train running for a Mercedes S class for one million miles (which will probably require 4 or 5 transmissions and 4 or 5 motors to get to a million miles).<p>But realistically people don&#x27;t repair 150K+ mile S classes because it would cost $30-40K to replace the tranny/engine plus all the other engine things while the car would be worth very little, so they junk it and buy a new car which means the cost of owning an S class for one million miles is more realistically the cost of owning 5 or 6 S classes.",1453732452

At that point you&#x27;re way beyond beginner level.<p>Same goes for &#x27;8. Use JSX, ES6, Babel, Webpack, and NPM&#x27; - JSX aside, setting up this tool stack is totally unnecessary for a beginner getting started hacking on a Hello World app. This is something you do after you&#x27;ve learned React, and you want to use use it in a &#x27;real&#x27; project.

I would offer one word of caution, which I think is especially pertinent to those coming from a CS background (and, I should add, not something this book particularly does, as far as I have read).<p>Historically and practically, biology as a field has often represented processes and events in an highly linearized and well defined fashion. This is extremely attractive for a number of reasons. As one key example, we (as humans) remember through narrative, and so the construction of a Rube Goldberg type description of a process is often a useful technique for easy recall of complicated information (&quot;A hits B which winds up C and switches on D <i></i>etc<i></i>...&quot;).<p>The other reason is that many of the experiments would really imply a linear pathway if that were all one look for. There <i></i>is<i></i> often a clear-cut progression of information signals or metabolic intermediates moving from one state to another state through well defined intermediates, such that if that were what you were looking for, you&#x27;d find it.<p>In this representation, many biological processes are highly analogous to computer programs which perform some task - you have an input, and through functional manipulation generate an output.<p>The realty, as has been uncovered in the last 15-20 years, is that most of these processes and events are not linear pathways. They are wildly heterogenous networks that integrate information spanning a range of temporal and spatial scales. The non-equilibrium nature of the cell means that, to a certain extent, everything is coupled to everything else through interactions where the associated coupling coefficients are also dependent on everything else.<p>The reason I bring this up is that I think it&#x27;s very temping to find analogies between CS and biology (DNA = hard drive, RNA = memory etc). The problem with this is that we (again, as humans) implemented the underlying computer architecture, while we&#x27;re only scratching the surface of biological complexity. By prescribing that some mapping of CS-to-biology exists we risk convincing ourselves that we understand the biology better than we do, or making assumptions regarding how the biology may or may not work.<p>Clearly, this kind of description can be used early on, but its important to recognize that these analogies should be viewed as broad-brush stroke descriptors and not functional ones.",1453731049

That seems to be kind of the point:  rules elegance is neither necessary or sufficient to create a good game (though, arguably, it helps:  see Go).  Having a single piece with far more offensive power than any other is interesting, which is good in actual gameplay.<p>The queen is absolutely the wrong thing to pick on, though.  Castling would be an obvious example, but my go-to is <i>En passant</i>.  The pawn double-move is obviously inelegant (sharing the problem with castling that it may only ever be a piece&#x27;s first move), but it inarguably makes the game better.  If you&#x27;ve ever tried playing without it, you know that it makes the opening both faster and more interesting.<p>However, the pawn double-move introduces a strategic problem where a pawn can sometimes skip past another.  The <i>en passant</i> rule is thus introduced as an obvious fix for that bug.<p>It would be problematic to have either of these rules without the other, and neither is particularly elegant, but the combination improves the game a lot.<p>See also:  the infield fly rule in Baseball, the shot clock in any sport that has a shot clock, I&#x27;m sure anyone can name several more.",1453730859

After all in every native UI framework you have instructions to draw the widget IN your code -- not as some external additional technology. A widget&#x27;s C/C++/Obj-C/Swift/Java/C# etc code encapsulates everything about creating it and showing it.<p>So, the better way is to have all your widget drawing depending on external (or internally stored if you must) state, happen inside the widget code itself. Not to try to manipulate a string template by sprinkling ad-hoc instructions like for-each and if-then.<p>And here&#x27;s the better part. React doesn&#x27;t really mix HTML inside JS.<p>JSX might look like doing such, but it&#x27;s just sugar for calling Javascript functions. <div> is essentially something like: React.createElement(null, &quot;div&quot;); So, the &quot;HTML&quot; is just calls to DOM manipulation methods.<p>So, with React there&#x27;s just JS, and it handles all the creation of the HTML code for a &quot;component&quot; (widget). It&#x27;s also composable, so your panel is just a components embedding other components.",1453730404
