But this is a popular model in videogames, and it somehow both pissess off players <i>and</i> earns the studios tons of money.<p>You obviously can&#x27;t apply it to every movie, but you could appply it to quite a few. For instance, there&#x27;s little point in extra content for Inception, because the movie world is defined by the start and the end of that very movie, and as you said, it has to make sense in its basic version. But consider things with already established franchises. I Disney would start publishing DLC sub-stories to the Force Awakens, I&#x27;m betting that every hardcore Star Wars fan would feel obliged to see them. The world portrayed in the movie is much bigger than the movie itself, and is has communities formed around it. To participate in the fandom, you need to be up to date with the canon. I&#x27;m pretty sure it could work with Marvel Cinematic Universe as well.<p>Then there are movies for which such a move would be a gamble. LotR and Hunger Games are franchises too, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re strong enough to support DLC money-grab.<p>Anyway, enough suggesting ideas to them :). I absolutely hate DLCs.

From an individual standpoint you stand to gain the most from the scooter since your vote is just a drop in a bucket. This is the most rational choice.<p>Collectively, everyone acting rationally produces unintended results. It&#x27;s a weird phenomenon logically described here as the tragedy of the commons: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons</a>.  Even if you try to do something counter-intuitive, whatever choice you make as an individual is still inconsequential in terms of voting.<p>For example let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s time to vote. I live in california and I&#x27;m a democrat, the voting is probably gonna go blue anyway regardless of whether or not I vote. So why not choose the scooter?<p>Let&#x27;s say I end up choosing the scooter. Then, when the results come out, I realize not enough democrats voted because they all went for the scooter. Thus the state actually ended up being red.<p>So I decide to take a hypothetical time machine back into time to change my decision. Now I choose to vote Blue instead of get a free scooter. Well guess what? the outcome is still the same; the rest of california still makes the same decision regardless of whether or not I vote. The difference is, in one scenario I have a scooter, in the other scenario I don&#x27;t have a scooter... every other factor in both outcomes remains the same. Whatever choice I make from an individual standpoint the Logical choice is ALWAYS the free scooter.<p>In the end to make a better world there needs to be a sort of collective idiocracy, which is kind of what&#x27;s going on in this thread right now: (You all think you guys are so smart because you didn&#x27;t go for the scooter).<p>How about this: free scooter for anyone who votes democrat!

I don&#x27;t think your assumption holds, it is very well possible to be a privacy advocate and to at the same time not have any crucial secrets worth keeping.<p>Privacy is a good thing, whether you have secrets worth keeping or not is immaterial, privacy doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with secrecy. The two are often mixed but if you look a bit longer you&#x27;ll see that they are in fact orthogonal concepts only very loosely related.<p>Taking your bathroom example: there is obviously nothing secret about what is going on in that bathroom, you can infer most of it from your own experience. And yet, we do seem to feel the need for privacy.<p>Another example would be a diary. Diaries are intensely personal and our etiquette around them is that if you happen to come across someone&#x27;s diary that you do not open it to read it. It is considered a private document, even if it will not contain any secrets it may contain thoughts that the writer does not want to divulge to the world at large.<p>So privacy does not require any secrets at all to be a very important thing to many people, including privacy advocates.",1452171050

Maybe they value other policies (for example abortion, but of course there are lots and lots of policies to consider even if you remove those directly related to the economy or religion) more than how it will effect you financially. If you polled the poorest 20% of Americans saying &quot;would you be willing to pay $20/year if in return abortion will become illegal in the entire country&quot; I don&#x27;t know how many would say yes, but I&#x27;d bet it wouldn&#x27;t be none.<p>Another reason I&#x27;ve often heard suggested as helping poor people in the US vote fot politicians who won&#x27;t help their financial situation is that of the &quot;American Dream&quot;, the idea that anyone who works hard can rise up and become wealthy.

Here in Europe, working class people who vote towards the right are more likely to be doing it either about stuff like immigration into the country, or when far right parties make themselves sound like common sense honest people compared to typical misleading politicians.

10857581,comment,10842815,10857283,0,0,kefka,,,"Oh yes. I talk greatly about that on my blog, crankylinuxuser.net<p>All in all, there are open standards in which IoT devices could communicate: MQTT(mosquitto), CoAP(Californium), AMQP(rabbitMQ) to name a few. Yet, none of the major vendors will touch these technology stacks, precisely because of lock-in to their special-snowflake database servers.<p>There are solutions, of which only 1 is palatable.<p>1. Don&#x27;t buy. (Dumb house, but at least you control it.)<p>2. Only buy company offerings that support the above standards. (Good luck.)<p>3. Build it yourself.<p>I&#x27;m going down the path of &quot;Do it yourself.&quot; I already have a gateway controller acquiring data from sensors and sending data to things like wirelessly connected Neopixels (ws2811 strands). The radio I&#x27;m using is a mesh network chip called nRF24L01+ and the Arduino library is MySensors. Things just work, and work well. I have data dumping into a MQTT Mosquitto instance and processing logic resides in Node-Red.<p>The other part of the Corporate &quot;We hold your data&quot; policy is the main reason they give: so you can control your devices from anywhere. Sounds great. Our solutions are to use things like No-IP.org , but you end up with a max 4 device limit. Not to mention, they also have a draconian ToS. So what else can you use? TOR. ..?<p>What? The essence is that you install TOR on your machine, and edit the /etc/tor/torrc and turn on a hidden service to SSH and HTTPS. Reconfigure Node-Red to use self-signed certs and enable authentication. Now you have access to the GUI to create flows as well as webpages within the flow. I have a nice discussion how to do everything from hardware on up here:<p><a href=""https://crankylinuxuser.net/2015/10/17/so-you-wanna-iot-a-howto-on-internet-of-things-1-of-many/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crankylinuxuser.net/2015/10/17/so-you-wanna-iot-a-ho...</a><p><a href=""https://crankylinuxuser.net/2016/01/05/so-you-wanna-iot-a-howto-on-internet-of-things-2-of/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crankylinuxuser.net/2016/01/05/so-you-wanna-iot-a-ho...</a><p>But in a nutshell, TOR isn&#x27;t just for anonymizing, secure internet. It&#x27;s also great for punching holes in firewalls and NATs and stuff to provide a service anyone can get to. Just be smart about it, secure the open ports down, and keep your onion site hidden as well.<p>I&#x27;ve been railed against before for my unpopular opinions regarding this topic. But things are only going to get worse with every company who decides to reinvent the wheel, so they can have your data. And not to mention pilfering your data, does the idea of &quot;No Internet, no House automation&quot; sound like a good idea?",1452170667

Start interviewing other CTOs at other startups and understand what their roles are and what they need to do. Build relationships with them so that you have a network of advisors if you ever need someone to have a chat with. Learn a lot. Do a lot of research. Do a lot of thinking.<p>Leadership is not all about experience. Leadership is also about listening. And all leaders start from somewhere. Once you have an open mind to learn, you&#x27;ll realize that being a leader is about being courageous and responsible for the happiness of other people. It&#x27;s also about helping to steer the ship in the right direction. But with all startups, you&#x27;re making decisions on minimal information. What you need is a mind of learning. Test and learn and never assume you know it all. Then you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>The salary issue is another big issue. Would it be worth to trade away your salary for the experience that you get? How will you survive? Do you have enough savings? Do you have a backup plan? If you&#x27;re not getting any salary, then you should get significant amount of equity. And at this stage, as the CTO, will you also have to build the product? Job titles at early stage don&#x27;t matter much.<p>Lastly, do you trust your boss enough that he will steer the ship correctly? Do you think he has what it takes to make it all work? And how is your relationship with him? Will he listen to your opinions or is he going to make all the decisions by himself?<p>Good luck",1452169023
