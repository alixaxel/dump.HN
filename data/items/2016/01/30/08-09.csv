It is so focused on running application in containers that it does not even have a package manager to install packages (Hence, they have different update/patching mechanism).

It also provides a bunch of tools for your cluster management and service discovery across containers/applications in your cluster.<p>PS: the above is a very summarized, focused answer to your question.

Saying &quot;reducing global inequality&quot;, do you mean something like communism, where everybody shall be equal? Please, don&#x27;t take my question negatively. I have myself lived in a communist country and I think it had both good and bad parts. Essentially it boils down to whether everybody becomes equally miserable or equally happy.\n Another problem that I could see with globally open borders, is that people may not actually want it. They tend to side with similar ones (race, language, religion,sexual orientation, income, mentality etc). This has been shown scientifically in 1971 in Thomas Schelling&#x27;s segregation model. We are actually witnessing this on a very large scale all over the western world. Have a look at Germany for example. There are about 2-3 generations (~3 millions) of Turks that have not dissolved in the German culture and are actually quite compact from a social networking perspective. People have been like this for centuries and I don&#x27;t think it is realistic or even fair to expect they will change (e.g. Kurds, Gipsies ...). Even in the US, which has a good reputation of being able to dissolve immigrants into the US culture, we see Chinese and black neighbourhoods.\nThat said, I do think that it makes sense to do research on how such segregated groups may live together (in close proximity) peacefully and sustainably. I guess that to some extent these problems are a subject of the military science, although it is probably trying to solve the opposite problems as well (i.e. divide and conquer).",1454142194

Can we treat nerve cells to transmit and receive light over a fiber optics, letting us bridge gaps in existing neural paths? something like that night go a long way to healing all sorts of neural degenerative disease, and possibly deal with paralysis as well.<p>Perhaps eventually something along the lines of plug and play hardware for humans, if you can come up with some sort of universal spec for it.",1454141015
