Mortgages are responsible for making housing less affordable for everyone.<p>In the old days when people actually saved up to buy a house, the average house would cost something like 4 times the average person&#x27;s annual salary. Today, we&#x27;re looking at 10 to 20 times.<p>Mortgages allow people who would otherwise not have been able to afford a house to buy it outright - This increases the demand for housing and thus drives prices up. In the old days, people worked hard to achieve the American dream (it was an optimistic pursuit). Today, people work hard to avoid bankruptcy (we have become a fear-driven society).<p>As for &#x27;investing in companies&#x27; - Big firms like Goldman Sachs mostly invest in big corporations which enslave people for profit. People in finance are more interested in helping big companies create and maintain strategic monopolies than allowing new companies to improve people&#x27;s lives. Monopolies are profitable and don&#x27;t require any R&D investment.<p>As for savings accounts, well they&#x27;re not so bad, but what is the point of having a savings account if you have no money to put in it?\nAlso, with all the new automated payment features offered, people are encouraged to spend all their little money on things that they don&#x27;t need. That means everything significant has to be purchased using credit.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that all of these evils leverage off of each other to make things even worse overall. For example, the rise of corporations means that people are forced to move to big cities to find jobs (since jobs are harder to find in smaller towns - Because small businesses there are being crushed by corporations), this drives city apartment prices up, which increases the amount of mortgage people have to take to buy a house, which increases peoples&#x27; dependence on their jobs and reduces their ability to negotiate better salaries and prevents them from improving their conditions of living.<p>As corporations take a hold on agriculture, the nutritional quality of food keeps going down (see <a href=""http://calmscience.net/2015/12/11/tale-of-tasteless-tomatoes-why-vegetables-do-not-taste-good-anymore/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://calmscience.net/2015/12/11/tale-of-tasteless-tomatoes...</a>) and the standard of living of the working class keeps dropping lower and lower.",1454132307

There are huge tracks of research areas which essentially are technologically backwards. From poor usage of statistics (see all the the replication issues in cancer research, psychology, and etc) to the lack of high quality programming tools to efficiently solve problems. More startups building cheap, applicable, and open-specification hardware with open source software could be a huge boon. The hardware and equipment situation of many scientific labs is stuck in the 90&#x27;s at best and often based on equipment developed in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s.<p>Having just finished a master&#x27;s in material science in applied bio-mechanical research I am personally aware of the lack of basic equipment and tools. Machine learning techniques for example could be applied to many areas of experimental research in biological settings but most labs do not have the time, money, or expertise to apply it. Another possible option would be a sort of &quot;professional software development co-op&quot; for scientific research. Being able to buy (subsidized) development resources might be incredibly helpful. The cost could possibly be offset by forming partnerships to commercialize valuable research, similar to a YC model where the few successes could fund the other.<p>The system for basic scientific research also seems broken. Much of the data used in many fields (especially nuclear research) is based on (very excellent) research from the 50&#x27;s.

This requires a long conversation where one would explore and try to understand the entire context.  I can&#x27;t fault your or praise you in any way, not enough data.<p>In general, though, I&#x27;d say business owners (and good managers) are hungry for good employees who &quot;get it&quot;.  And, if they are smart, they&#x27;ll recognize these employees.<p>But you also don&#x27;t want one-hit-wonders.  What you are after are people dedicated to the long term mission.  Anyone can bust ass for a few months, get a raise and then proceed to rest on their laurels.<p>Recognition for good people often comes in the way of raises and promotions over time.  You might invest a few years at a company doing good work and contributing value yet not necessarily see much in the way of praise and adoration.  And then, one day, you get a promotion.  Because people are watching and paying attention.  That&#x27;s the way it works in some places.",1454131758

Others who somehow manage to stay in formal institutions are exposed to decontextualized education that they cannot realize their full potential.<p>There will be many different solutions to it. One of them could be a large-scale, technology-immersed learning system that teaches a broad range of topics to students through a vocation. The vocation could be decided based on the learner&#x27;s interest and the local resources. For example, in northern Nepal, child walk through perilous snow-covered hills and mountains to recover Yarsagumba (&quot;Himalayan viagra&quot;), a fungus with aphrodisiac and medicinal value. Instead, the kids can be educated progressively in details about different aspects surrounding Yarsagumba - mountain climbing, biological systems, business, marketing (where they could sell the collected Yarsagumba), greenhouse and high-tech farming systems, technology, etc. - without disturbing their Yarsamgumba collecting activity.<p>This is a simple example. Since a diverse topics are being taught and practiced, learners would not be restricted in the same vocation.",1454131684

(Though this took a hit recently due to the recent introduction of the `maps` feature, which was designed in such a way as to encourage violating that last guideline, despite proposals for a similar feature which would not have violated it.)<p>Surprisingly, C also meets all but two of these guidelines, and, although it is an egregious violator of those both, it is somewhat amenable to static analysis (see Coverity).<p>JavaScript, on the other hand, is notoriously difficult to statically analyze, since it not only <i>permits</i> code to violate all the above guidelines, but it&#x27;s <i>common</i> for code to violate all of them.",1454130616

They are pretty close to definition of &quot;normal&quot;, because that&#x27;s just how carbon-based lifeforms (or, probably, any theoretically possible lifeforms at all) work. The result of any individual mutation might be not pleasant: child might be born defective or ugly, but that&#x27;s… well, &quot;natural&quot;. People tend to avoid unusual, so even though some ugly chicken with two peckers and one eye might be completely healthy food — many will think it&#x27;s disgusting and won&#x27;t eat it. And, as I said, random mutations cause relatively subtle changes in phenotype, so it would take many, many generations for such chickens to become normal even if we selectively breed them to have two peckers. Even single such mutation is something pretty unlikely without strong external influence, like high radiation or some chemicals. And if specie changes a lot during multiple generations — it becomes normal. If they survived through so many generations, and we still eat them: it somehow &quot;works&quot;, one might think.<p>Genetic engineering, on the other hand, didn&#x27;t happen for a couple of billions years until last century, is very much avoidable and immensely powerful. Consider making a pig glow through selective breading. Seems pretty unlikely, yeah? Well, it&#x27;s simple now, if you tinker some with genome of a pig and a jellyfish. And that&#x27;s just an illustration: possibilities of what you can produce are nearly unlimited. I don&#x27;t want to quote Spiderman&#x27;s uncle here, but I guess you get the point. One might not even actually think glowing pig is dangerous, but it&#x27;s certainly suspicious. Which is more than sufficient reason to beware of something or to want to avoid it.<p>The best thing about living nature is that something, that can seem completely safe and uninteresting at first, might be a cause for something much bigger than it seemed. Like, you know, bringing a couple of rabbits to Australia[1].<p>As a side note, you should probably remember when arguing with those &quot;anti GM&quot; friends of yours, that thinking of something as dangerous isn&#x27;t the only reason why somebody might not like something. Say, they might happen to not like green wallpapers — it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they think green wallpapers are dangerous. They just don&#x27;t want them, maybe for religious reasons or whatever. So if <i>everyone</i> suddenly starts producing only green wallpapers because it&#x27;s simply cheaper, and any other colors become rare, ridiculously overpriced and are treated by sellers as a luxury product — they can become &quot;anti-grean-wallpaper&quot; very easily. In attempt to bring balance to the force, if nothing more. Add to that that not everyone is perfectly rational — which is kinda ok as well — and there can be infinite number of reasons why somebody might be anti-something.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_in_Australia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_in_Australia</a>",1454130535

Many brilliant people are able to knock out their assigned and existential objectives by solving complex problems and are handsomely rewarded with hefty checks. But, if you ask them questions outside their comfort zone about, for example, running a business, designing for the user, or marketing, most would be quick to point out that those aren&#x27;t responsibilities that fall on their plate.<p>To me, it sounds like you have a fervor for being more than just an employee. You want to take ownership of your work. You want to use your brain for your own benefit, not for some other corporation to rent out. You want the grittiness of taking on multiple roles and welcome being side by side with your users.<p>There are many of us out here, coding as self-starters, founders, freelancers, remote workers, and small business owners. It isn&#x27;t for everyone, and if you are happy or content with your full time job, then it&#x27;s probably not for you. That&#x27;s ok.<p>But for those of us who have found ways to make it work outside of what can feel like the soul-crushing environment of a typical full-time workplace, the devs building on their own, grinding out client work, doing remote year, making products - ask any of them, and you&#x27;ll find that coding as a employee wasn&#x27;t right for them, either.<p>I&#x27;d encourage you to read my post on the way I fell into this line of thought, but for me, I was coming from a job that I actually really liked: <a href=""http://davekiss.com/getting-started-with-passive-income/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davekiss.com/getting-started-with-passive-income/</a><p>You don&#x27;t need to code as an employee to code as a career.

There, practically all seats are held by season ticket holders (whose annual season ticket price is usually the same as, or sometimes even HIGHER than (hypothetical, generally not available) single game ticket pricing), and where the &quot;rights&quot; to a season ticket can trade for lots of $$$ (thousands) on the secondary market.... you can&#x27;t just buy tickets, you have to buy an existing ticket holder&#x27;s account, essentially.
