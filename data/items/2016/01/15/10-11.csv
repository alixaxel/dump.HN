Most users (in ring 11) have null pointers of 0xB00000000000.<p>This is a bit confusing because the &quot;null constant&quot; is an integral 0 e.g. `(void <i>) 0` is a null pointer, but it&#x27;s defined as an arbitrary compiler instruction. `(void </i>) foo` where foo is 0 at runtime may not be a null pointer at all.<p>[0] <a href=""http://c-faq.com/null/machexamp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c-faq.com/null/machexamp.html</a>",1452855480

Things were far, far different back in 2011-2012, before the first big price jumps led the current crown on board.  Ironically, their &quot;participation&quot; in the project (mostly screaming, censoring, and belly-aching on Reddit) will only cause the thing their fear most: a Bitcoin bus-plunge and loss of most of their assets.<p>Mike, if you read this, I was only a minor player in Bitcoin core (< 5 commits) but I appreciated your work and particularly your talks about Bitcoin, as well as your work on Bitcoinj, an extremely well-led open source project.

They told us that the original 20mb limit Gavin proposed was too high, but that they could accept 8mb. So we compromised and went with 8 + a growth function. Then after XT was launched they changed their mind and said any growth after 8 at all was totally unacceptable. Now they&#x27;re telling the Classic guys that 2 is the most they could handle. Did the Chinese internet border really get 4x worse in the span of 3 months? I doubt it.<p>Western miners aren&#x27;t much better. One told me quite clearly they&#x27;d start voting for BIP101 back in November (though: voting in such a way that it wouldn&#x27;t actually activate!). But they didn&#x27;t. When I followed up, they again said it was on their todo list and they&#x27;d start really soon.

10908259,comment,10906232,10906232,0,0,unoti,,,"I&#x27;ve done three things for emergency preparedness that are actually quite fun and I&#x27;d recommend to anyone:<p>1) Become a certified emergency medical responder. It&#x27;s a one semester course you can take at your local community college. It&#x27;s the first step to becoming an EMT if you want to keep going. You learn things including CPR, wound management, dealing with broken bones, heart attacks, car accidents, transporting patients, even emergency childbirth. I enjoyed the class immensely. Now I&#x27;m a lot less afraid of medical disasters because I have a plan and an impressive first aid kit, and I know how to use it.<p>2. Become an amature radio operator. As a technologist, it&#x27;s fun to get in touch with my roots using older technology. I&#x27;ve been working on being able to operate using battery and solar panels, which has been a blast to learn about and experiment with.  I can also operate portably while camping, bouncing waves off the atmosphere and back either towards the horizon to talk thousands of miles away, or straight up towards space and reflecting off the atmosphere back down to talk within a 300 mile range (this is called NVIS).  Learning and practicing these skills is awesome fun.<p>3. Camping, and having the food water and equipment in hand to camp for several days.  We have a few 7 gallon water tanks we use for camping which we keep full, in addition to our always evolving camping supplies.  We take frequent camping trips.<p>Doing these things is educational, challenging, enriching and fun! I encourage everyone to do it.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that you can get a ham radio for $40 that&#x27;s higher power and will work at longer range than the FRS/GMRS radios. The FCC limits FRS radios to half a watt, and ham radios don&#x27;t have that limit.",1452852034

We currently make heavy use of PR descriptions in quite specific formats, and it felt like Reviewable was forcing itself upon us.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m really glad someone is looking at this problem, and Reviewable looks like a step in the right direction.
