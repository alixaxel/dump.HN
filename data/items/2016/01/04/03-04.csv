However, if you are correct, it would suggest our modern efforts at treating stroke victims are a complete waste of time and effort, a statement I think the patients and their families post-treatment would find puzzling.<p>People who have early success within an area of study will tend to think of themselves as a natural and will put in more practice time than a person who has not had early success.

But I don&#x27;t exclusively consume media content from Netflix either.<p>> DVD/BlueRay gives a lot better experience than streaming<p>First, I often don&#x27;t care about the video quality of the content I&#x27;m consuming. Sure if it is a sci-fi action film I want surround sound and 4k or whatever. But most the time, a degraded qualify for a standup act or period drama doesn&#x27;t really matter nor is it noticeable to me. Also I can&#x27;t really tell the difference as much on a tablet or phone rather than my big screen.<p>Second, the streaming services are cost constrained right now on the quality front, but it seems like that is improving and likely to change at some point in the not too distant future. And some of the services let you get higher quality, right now, just with additional cost.<p>Third, streaming is right now much more convenient in meaningful ways. It doesn&#x27;t have the hassle of dealing with physical media (acquiring it, storing it, sorting through it, loading it, discarding/reselling). It provides access to a larger library of content on demand. It allows for seamless resumption of paused or interrupted viewings on different devices. Access if available for any internet connected location. Content is often available faster, such as within minutes of broadcast, rather than waiting for a delivery or next day to head to a store.<p>Fourth, with the exception of a few beloved films, most the content I watch isn&#x27;t something I ever intend to watch again.

Therefore it seems clear that, in aggregate, startups create wealth.<p>I suppose one could argue that <i>more</i> wealth would be created if everyone went to work for large, established companies, or started lifestyle businesses, rather than starting startups.  At the very least it would be more difficult to disprove that assertion, but using the same logic as above it seems unlikely to be true.  For all we&#x27;re immersed in startup culture here, the number and people and amount of capital focused on startups is still small relative to the rest of the economy, and yet the benefits we&#x27;ve seen from just a few high-profile ones, let alone the smaller benefits accrued by many others, are very significant.<p>[1] Although, just because a startup &quot;fails&quot; does not mean that it has not created wealth during its existence.  Obviously any time two people voluntarily make some sort of exchange (absent mistakes), wealth is created.  IE, both people are necessarily better off than they would have been otherwise, else they would not have made the exchange.
