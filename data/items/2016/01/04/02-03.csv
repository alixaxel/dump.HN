Neuroplasticity is no longer what it was, and the quicker one reconciles themselves to that fact the quicker they can figure out what they both excel at and enjoy. There&#x27;s tons of things that are just <i>in the brain</i>. I come from a family of academics where every male in my family was either a PhD or an MD except for my paternal grandfather. Most of them are of Oxbridge pedigree, ranging from post-docs with Nobel Laureates to tenured faculty at those East-coast liberal schools Ann Coulter hates so much. Math came ridiculously easy to me, nature or nurture I&#x27;m not sure. Then I started going to conferences and seeing people who were of Terrance Tao caliber. No matter how hard I train, I&#x27;ll never win a Fields medal. My brain is no longer malleable. One of the reasons I went into industry instead of academia was meeting people 20 year old first year grad students who were of one subset of mathematics, take 4 months to sit down and study an entirely different subset and start collaborating, then outperforming post-docs who&#x27;ve spent ~10 years on it. I&#x27;m convinced we all have more or less the same ability to perform at that level, just in different fields. Most of us will never be able to out-return Andre Agassi, but they might just be <i>naturally</i>[I use this term loosely since we know so little about the neurological methodologies by which we acquire and integrate knowledge, problem solve, etc we can&#x27;t quantify  what differentiates one&#x27;s propensity for a skillset from anothers] great at poker, tearing down an engine in 20 minutes, or precision pilotry.",1451875895

Atomic add is 50-1000+ clock cycles depending on contention, core/socket count and &quot;moon phase&quot; -- latency is somewhat unpredictable.<p>> In particular, they can have weaker ordering semantics and they can be buffered and elided among themselves (obviously with some sort of inter-core snooping).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how weak ordering semantics and fetch-and-add (atomic add) could mix.

This is propaganda meant to be shoved down the throats of the gullible western citizen and many fall for it. It is spread by people with Zionist inclination to keep these citizens, specifically in the US and in the general western nations (I am a Canadian from an Arab Palestinian background), in the service of the Zionists. Many would be laughing to read this but I consider, especially the US citizens, as much occupied by Zionism as my people in Palestine.<p>Back to the topic: &quot;Arabic-speaking armies have been generally ineffective in the modern era.&quot; Well you can stop right after this sentence, the rest is uninteresting as it is talking about &quot;armies&quot; which went into war in 1973. But if we scratch the word army and ask the question in the title &quot;Why Arabs Lose Wars&quot; and look back just at the recent wars Arabs, the people not the armies<i>, fought, you would have a completely different picture and get a completely different answer. Like myself, you don&#x27;t have to be a military expert, to reach that conclusion. Just go back to the war against Lebanon in 2006. The effectiveness of the guerrilla fighter of Hizbolla would make the Navy Seals envious. Look back at the wars against the besieged Gaza strip - the largest prison in the world. Just watch the progress in the effectiveness of the fighter of Hamas (who are besieged by the Zionists as well as the Camp David regime in Egypt). Just look at the map and see how arduous it is for them to smuggle their rockets for thousands of miles and still they succeed. How did they fight in 2008? 2012? 2014? Go and look at Youtube and compare the effectiveness of the Arab fighter with the Zionist one.<p>Why Arabs Lose Wars? The only way to win against Arabs is complete destruction of their cities from afar just like the Americans did to the city of Fallujah, the Zionists to the Shujayia neighbourhood in Gaza, to the city of Bent Jbeil in South Lebanon. If you put techologies aside and just compare soldier to soldier, courage to courage, there is no match. Do you know any nation in history or across the planet that had so many people ready to pull a trigger and sacrifice himself or herself for his nations freedom? You might say that&#x27;s terrorism but that&#x27;s beside the point. Actually the majority of those sacrificed themselves (from ISIS, to ALQEDA) to the service of Saudi Arabia (the tool of the US) and for it&#x27;s own wars in Afganistan, Serbia, Iraq, Syria (all wars orchestrated by the US).<p>----------------\n</i> these armies are just tools of governments all of whom from Morocoo to Iraq are friends the western governments.",1451874730

The comic wealth that came as a result of that deregulation has allowed Wall Street to chokehold politicians in campaign finance and squeeze out from them financial policies that can only be fairly be described as federal handjobs.</i><p>Such shameless and misguided populism. Ostensibly, &quot;Wall Street&quot; are an evil cabal and not at all subservient to incentives granted by the state? Interesting. You could certainly critique the financial sector on basis of Hyman Minsky or even on basis of credit-driven boom-bust cycles, but this simplistic narrative of deregulation is insulting.<p><i>What actually happens is wealthy people like Paul Graham fund startups because they think these things are valuable. Through venture funding, rich people legitimate startups. Thus, they confer value upon the startup.</i><p>No shit. Value is subjective. Or perhaps you&#x27;re still stuck in the political economy of Ricardo, I take it?<p><i>We, as a people, determine what is and is not of value mostly through what we believe to be legitimate and worthy of significance. And in late capitalism, we have all basically agreed to allow the market to dictate what is and is not of legitimate value. (This is what social critics recognize as Neoliberalism.)<p>But what the market deems valuable is not necessarily aligned with what is ultimately good for us as a society or even what we want. Because under conditions of extreme inequality, the market is biased towards people who have lots of money, at the expense of virtually everyone else.</i><p>What does this person think &quot;the market&quot; is? Some being existing independently of humans? Markets consist of exchanges, valuations and schedules of human participants, constrained by the institutional framework of governance in a particular jurisdiction.<p>That&#x27;s not what &quot;neoliberalism&quot; is, either. Neoliberalism has two different meanings in the field of international relations, and in political economy. Neither of them have to do with the fallacious reasoning expressed above.<p>And just what, pray tell, is this mystical &quot;social utility,&quot; some objectively measurable quantity of what is &quot;good for society&quot;? Demagogues always love to speak of it, and almost always it is a coded phrase for making humans subservient to whatever state policies they envision. There might be &quot;social utility&quot; in some theoretical metaphysical sense. In practice, one <i>cannot</i> do interpersonal comparisons of utility, hence the famous &quot;utility monster&quot; paradox illustrated by Nozick. Thus to speak of any greater societal good without taking into account that every individual has preferences that they reveal, is a folly.<p>Now, the question of money. What is money? It can be many things, most notably a medium of exchange. But it&#x27;s also an accounting device for settling debt obligations and coordinating exchanges through time. One of the key insights of the mutualists and later heterodox monetary reformers like E.C. Riegel is that there is no reason for the latter accounting function to be monopolized by a state. Having groups of people issue their own debt instruments to intertemporally coordinate their consumption and production on coarse-grained collective levels, perhaps through a mutual credit bank, would be a great boon on many. This is not the fault of capitalism that it&#x27;s so rare. It is the monetary monopoly of the state doing this. It is an unrelated issue.<p><i>That is not the future I want so I really have no choice but to insist that we resist and come to terms with the fact that the Market we call god is a sick and twisted god, indeed.</i><p>The market is not our god. Not even close.<p><i>People like Paul Graham need to write essays like this so you don’t question how undemocratic a market system is under conditions of extreme wealth inequality.</i><p>&quot;Undemocratic&quot;. Another baseless buzzword. The market is not undemocratic. Its democracy operates on a more fine-grained level, and moreover for market participants to form a collective body of action to pool resources (like a corporation) requires unanimous approval on part of these people. A state only needs a thin majority (if at all).",1451873664

I&#x27;m educated, have interesting and rewarding work to do, have a roof over my head, and get to play music on the side. I&#x27;ve got two great kids, who are both smarter than me. What&#x27;s wrong with that? Why should I be neurotic about success? Why should push myself and my kids harder than I was pushed? And make no mistake, I was pushed.<p>Because I can see that my class -- the middle class -- is vanishing, so the expectations of my generation are no longer valid. Get an OK degree in <i>something worthwhile</i> and work hard. Gone. I literally followed exactly the same education and career path as my father.

My kids are ahead of where I was at the same age, in terms of simplistic milestones like Algebra. They have perfect GPA&#x27;s. I sure as hell didn&#x27;t. But the curriculum is more superficial and more based on drill work, worksheets, and computer busywork. They write more papers. That&#x27;s good. Their papers are written to fill out a thing called a <i>rubric</i>, which is a glorified worksheet. That&#x27;s bad. I recently found a copy of my 12th grade public school math textbook. More than half of the problems are proofs. Today there are no proofs. The proliferation of homework merely gives the <i>illusion</i> of a rigorous curriculum, and robs kids of the time that they could spend learning interesting things or just having fun.

The basic problem with embarrassing interviews, I think, is that they&#x27;re done by people whose job is not to interview. They&#x27;re just a side thing for engineers. Which means that a) there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;re just not any good at it, but have to do it anyway, and b) there&#x27;s no structural incentive to do it well or prepare thoroughly (quite the opposite: there&#x27;s an incentive to instead spend time you would&#x27;ve spent on interview preparation on your main job, since you do get evaluated there).<p>So just because a Google engineer performed very poorly as an interviewer, doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that they&#x27;re a bad engineer. They just may be very bad at interviewing.<p>Also, people are a heck of a lot more likely to talk about an interviewer that did terribly than one that did perfectly fine, and this is especially true for Google since it&#x27;d be at odds with their reputation, so there&#x27;s probably a selection bias at work.",1451873130
