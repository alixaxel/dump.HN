They have a very nice bulk rate with a very good (in my opinion as a developer and customer) background check API service that means the switch to fingerprinting would cost them SIGNIFICANTLY more per transaction than the background check system they&#x27;re currently using, which doesn&#x27;t support fingerprint checks.<p>EDIT: I don&#x27;t have any claims as to the accuracy of the system they use vs fingerprint systems but I can say that the backgrounds we get from the same system they use are just fine for our insurance underwriters and our background checks are for people operating vehicles as well.",1453561164

So 3GPP Rel 15 will be 5G Phase 1, and Rel 16 will be 5G Phase 2.<p>There will be LTE Advance Pro, which provides all the features up to Rel 14. As a matter of fact most of the latency reduction will be done in Rel 14, it is likely they start calling Rel 14 as 5G and continue to evolve on it.<p>And to be honest ( apart from T-Mobile I think ), LTE really do deserve the name 4G. It brings much faster access, and more importantly lower latency that feels so much faster when browsing the web.<p>As most user will properly not notice a difference between 300Mbps and 600Mbps. Let alone 1Gbps. So really the biggest benefits of these new release are increase in Capacity of Mobile Network. Most Network operator today are facing the same problem.",1453561095

The anonymous informant claims, &quot;JJ was determined to make BB-8 cute and strong – and female.&quot; But Daisy Ridley is quoted by <i>Time</i> as saying, &quot;I remember J.J. saying, &#x27;He&#x27;s not a child.&#x27;&quot; Abrams is quoted as telling <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, &quot;I named him BB-8  because it was almost onomatopoeia. It was sort of how he looked to me, with the 8, obviously, and then the two B&#x27;s.&quot; There&#x27;s a video of Abrams answering the question just before the film&#x27;s release at <a href=""http://collider.com/bb8-boy-girl-gender-star-wars-7-the-force-awakens/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://collider.com/bb8-boy-girl-gender-star-wars-7-the-forc...</a> with, &quot;I always referred to him as &#x27;he&#x27;, but that&#x27;s just sort of a, you know, I haven&#x27;t checked. I haven&#x27;t looked under the hood.&quot;<p>So I doubt the leaker&#x27;s claim that Abrams was &quot;determined to make BB-8 female&quot;.<p>2. A female robot is <i>just a tiny bit</i> different from a female human. But it&#x27;s not even that: it&#x27;s a gender-ambiguous robot, whose femininity consists of solely a pronoun used by one executive and an anonymous source, and could have easily been male. That seems to be a serious cop-out. You might as well say that the Millennium Falcon satisfies the request for female toys (the ship is regularly referred to as &quot;she&quot; in the original trilogy).",1453561079

The politicians and organizations supporting Syrian immigrants are yet to explain how exactly they want to instill into those millions of people the same values that allowed them to come to Europe in the first place. So far it seems that they tend to settle in isolated neighborhoods and continue living the way they&#x27;ve always been, occasionally causing some trouble outside (the forbidden t-word, rapes in Koln, etc).<p>BTW, a friend of mine had seen a group of those refugees in Hungary.

I&#x27;d like to ask your opinion about one thing in particular.<p>Why do you think this editor and writer would conceivably mention &quot;claims of seemingly impossible transmutations being conducted by a fringe experimenter in his apartment, using high-voltage electricity&quot;?<p>While you don&#x27;t specify what it is, let&#x27;s take it literally, a transmutation, so, whatever, iron goes in, electricity is applied, aluminum comes out (two different elements).  Some non sequitur.  <i>That just so happens to be done in his apartment???</i><p>What I mean is if this impossible transmutation is done in a field unrelated to aviation, the area of his expertise, why would he even report? I mean if he was very, very sure, he might refer the person via an anonymous letter to a chemistry professor or something, but to report it in his book?<p>If I (or I would think anyone else) were in his position and literally saw someone transmute aluminum to gold, then short of letting me take the machine (in a faraday cage) whereever I want in any undisclosed city (bringing cash and no electronic devices whatsoever, trying to lose any tails via taxis and hitchiking ) and verify his claim by renting an apartment there for cash, buying aluminum foil in a random corner store (along with reasonable generic stuff that can be used for baking), then transmuting it myself within the faraday cage and selling the resulting gold at some appraiser, repeating this at different local stores and different baskets of goods, until I had more gold than the total weight of the machine involved... then I would wait for the electricity bill at the apartment and compare with the value of the gold I generated.  Short of all that I literally wouldn&#x27;t even report <i>literally seeing someone transmute aluminum to gold.</i>  I just wouldn&#x27;t report it.  It&#x27;s absurd.  It&#x27;s totally non-credible.  By the way against state actors even the above process would fail, since the machine could generate electricity usage that&#x27;s very easy for a central location to notice, just spikes at certain times for example (certain tenths of seconds on highly synchronized clocks), even above all of the noise of households.  I guess I need a diesel power generator too.  You get the idea.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that the chances of the CIA getting a magician to come to my apartment and trick me is, I would say, oh, a hundred trillion?  a quadrillion? times higher than the chances that someone will show me a machine that does an impossible transmutation.  I am not exaggerating.  A hundred trillion is fourteen orders of magnitude, and a quadrillion is fifteen.  (For comparison, a hundred trillion bytes is just 100 terabytes, or thirteen of these - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Archive-Internal-Hard-Drive/dp/B00XS423SC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Archive-Internal-Hard-Drive/dp...</a>  -- yeah we are talking about 1 byte compared to all that storage.)  It&#x27;s absolutely absurd.<p>It shows a total lack of any grounding or objectivity for someone to report that.<p>Why would an aviation expert do it?  What does he get out of tarnishing his credibility with that kind of gobbledegook, even if he saw it in front of his own eyes?  Seeing something with your own eyes is not very convincing when your prior is one in a hundred trillion.",1453558358
