It was an awful question to ask, but his reply was seen as unemotional to the audience when he reiterated that he still would not support the death penalty. I often wonder what the U.S. would have been like had he been elected. In any case, the American public apparently had a similar notion, since they kicked out Bush Sr to elect a Democrat anyway, just 4 years later.

The problem is that the consumer wants the hits, the names, the current hot artists. They don&#x27;t want the long tail of unknown artists.<p>I think Soundcloud has a very different audience. In my opinion hardly anyone cares about the hits over there. And it isn&#x27;t a requirement to feature the hits in order to be successful. Ask Bandcamp, they are doing quite well with their endless niche catalog.<p>Personally, I consider myself a mostly digital crate digger who loves to explore obscure music and forgotten gems. Soundcloud is really helpful when trying to keep up with some of my favorite labels - an institution Spotify & Co. couldn&#x27;t care less for.

So he would say something like &quot;I don&#x27;t agree because...&quot; followed by a 15 second pause before continuing the sentence.<p>Pretty sure it was not intentional, it was just what he had converged on as his optimal conversational strategy, but it was incredibly frustrating for others. Partly just the endless pause, but also I think (after reading this article) that everyone is busily optimizing a response in real time while he talks, but when he stops talking mid sentence, suddenly the algorithm has no more input to process yet still knows there will be more coming at some point soon, so cannot complete and also cannot swap out, so instead goes into an uncomfortable spin wait state that gets quite exhausting after a while.",1453796648

My guess is that both platforms have something missing.<p>When I am shopping for music, which is what Spotify is supposedly for, then I think it is not enough to supply the music in digital form. The physical form that is independent of any current DRM annoiance and/or online website service is missing. For the music industry though, Spotify seems to be a pretty good model, where they can sell their stuff.<p>Soundcloud seemingly is a place to get recommendations on artists that I might like or a place to listen to music from independent artists. While there seems to be a lot music on Soundcloud, it may be a little too much. You might get lost in the noise and the community and algorithmic recommendation filters might not be enough. For the ones actually creating original music, Soundcloud seems to be a &quot;free beer&quot; approach. People get to listen to your music, but all you get in return is limited publicity. That might not be an enduring model for music creators, just during their initial phase of getting known.<p>Thus maybe another platform will emerge.",1453796558
