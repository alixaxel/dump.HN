It&#x27;s unclear to me whether they laundered money by supposedly buying and selling bitcoins or converted shadowy assets into BTC and then back to physical currency, but in both cases the transactions can be tracked back in the blockchain so you&#x27;ll not only have to make a good story of where the money came from but also, if and when the authorities get interested, make sure that how the BTC is moved around reflects that story.<p>But merely converting BTC to cash via ATMs doesn&#x27;t even sound like laundering to me at all, just conversion. You would still need to explain the cash you&#x27;ve acquired if you intend to buy something with it.<p>Money laundering itself is not for those in a hurry. To plausibly launder money you need a service business with costs that are rather fixed and customers who can plausibly pay with cash. Then you can have as many &quot;customers&quot; as you like and nobody can really tell how many you really might have had but depending on how you set up the scheme you can report a reasonable income over the months and years, pay the taxes and thus turn the money legally earned.",1453633181

Arguments for massive government subsidies such as $8K for rich people&#x27;s car Tesla is that this might speed up the economy of scale for these businesses and that it will eventually be affordable for ordinary people.

It&#x27;s also a bit tricky to be disciplined and use the correct instance of an application if it exists in both the host OS and the guest OS (even more so if you are using seamless windowing mode), Firefox as example i prefer to use in the host, because that one has all my extensions installed, but that means all the tabs i open that are related to the project will spill over to the next session when i close the project and switch to play-mode.",1453631115

Science, and the subsequent reporting on it, has been consistently reporting for the past 20 years that climate change is real, and it&#x27;s worse than we thought. Every few months, there is a new study being widely reported saying that X new evidence is proving that things will be much worse than we thought. If there was a study every once in a while that said X study about climate change was wrong, and we didn&#x27;t consider Y factor, but climate change still seems to be headed in a dangerous direction, then I think people might be more willing to accept the thesis.<p>Of course, the paper doesn&#x27;t suggest that we are wrong when we suspect systemic error, and skeptics of climate change may very well be wrong, but maybe this will help others understand their skepticism.",1453630198

It does have &#x27;web hooks&#x27; to update orders with tracking numbers and status updates. It also has some type of regular update to make sure that any orders left &#x27;open&#x27; are updated even if they should have been updated already.<p>It all works, but only 99% of the time... There are many orders left &#x27;open&#x27; with the only option being to look up the orders and assess them manually. This is a big task even with only 1% or so to follow up and double check.<p>So, despite the wonders of the &#x27;web hooks&#x27; approach, we are going back to API polling, to get all order updates since [last poll time] and updating order statuses accordingly. We will disable the web hooks once the straight API + polling approach is fully tested. A client library for the API will also have to be built so that simple getters and setters can be used for updating order statuses and inventory levels.<p>The &#x27;web hooks&#x27; approach ultimately does not work reliably enough for us, so a more thorough and robust solution is needed. Really it would have been better to have not gone the &#x27;web hooks&#x27; way at all, it would have spared us the problems we have had with only 99% of the information coming through.
