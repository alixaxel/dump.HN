It is a semantic-web style database build in Neo4j, .NET MVC, and KnockoutJS, and is an attempt to build a map of historical events and personalities for the digital humanities.<p><a href=""http://the-codex.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://the-codex.net</a><p>I am currently the sole developer, product designer, and researcher on the project -- but I am looking for collaborators who would be willing to help me take this further.<p>As an &quot;atlas of history&quot; is a broad concept I decided to give the project clarity by focusing primary source documents from the Italian Renaissance. The two main sources at present are the &#x27;Florentine Diary&#x27; of Luca Landucci and the letters of Michelangelo. I have entered about 40 years worth of entries from Landucci&#x27;s diary and a good portion of Michelangelo&#x27;s early letters from his Roman period. In the process I have added hundreds of historical personalities, places, artworks, etc., in order to give the user real data to work with. I have also built various screens with data visualisation tools to mine the historical events. And of course I have built an extensive back-end for managing the data and relationships.<p>Is anyone interested in helping me out? I&#x27;d love input from anyone with an interest in art history and graphic design, or data visualisation tool, Neo4j, or anyone who wants to help me research and enter data.<p>Feel free to email me any time at: iian.d.neill@gmail.com<p>In the meantime, why not check out the Control Panel on Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s dataset. Clicking any links in the text will load the datasets for those entities; or you can search for them by name. Why not try adding Michelangelo&#x27;s dataset to the mix? You can then switch between the three data-vis modes at the bottom, fiddle with the date filters, etc.<p><a href=""http://the-codex.net/Time/ControlPanel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://the-codex.net/Time/ControlPanel</a><p>Many thanks,\nIian",1453618560

Because the moment you start having titles that are &quot;exclusive&quot; to pay-per-view, your subscription users would riot, seeing this as just a way to raise fees (see: the uproar when Netflix tried to spin off the DVD business) on &quot;exclusive&quot; titles. It also goes against / dilutes the whole addictive nature of Netflix.<p>As an aside, the HN guidelines mention you should avoid complaining about being downvoted.",1453616182

Every time that this occurs, it just means that to watch that series you need to subscribe to anything up to 3 services. Regardless of the validity of this, it just leads to piracy.<p>Once you get global distribution rights to major series, then piracy will probably fall greatly. Until then, either piracy will increase, or folks will bypass geoblocking. I think that the hope should be that people will bypass geoblocking, because the rights holders at least get some money. With piracy, they get absolutely nothing.",1453616129

You should go read some philosophy of biology, if you are interested in these issues, there&#x27;s ton of stuff about this debate. The issue, as you are right to sense, isn&#x27;t about &quot;biological&quot; determinism; rather it is about whether genes are special or unique compared to other cues that affect the development of the organism (such as gravity). It&#x27;s a complicated issue, with various implications. I actually don&#x27;t think Levins is particularly important for this debate, by the way.

In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.[51] Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a &quot;toxic food environment” where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedent over healthy nutritious foods.&quot;",1453615380
