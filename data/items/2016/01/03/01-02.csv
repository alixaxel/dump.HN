I mean, our society basically interpolates individuals (younger generations at least) as existential subjects - no set path on what we should do with our lives, no God, no religion, we have to make our own meaning. Painful and difficult, but a source of freedom either way. Today I can travel as a digital nomad, found a startup, work for a rocketship, work for a stable, high paying company, freelance, or switch careers altogether. I get to choose who I associate with and date and marry (and it&#x27;s even acceptable to not marry), while choosing from a much larger, more open pool, and for the most part, I get to choose who I am. Not everyone has access to this freedom, but it&#x27;s still the point in human history when the largest number of people have ever had access to this freedom.",1451786194
10829124,comment,10827629,10828037,0,0,red-indian,,,"Many of us do not like the term native american. Native, related to nativity, means born somewhere. When we use this term other people will inevitably say, &quot;Hey I just realized something, I&#x27;m a native american too - I was born here just like you.&quot;<p>Use of the term Indian is considered rude in Canada where &quot;First Nations&quot; is widely accepted as the preferred term. However, Canada did previously use Indian, such as their law known as the Indian Act. The term &quot;Aboriginal&quot; in Canada has generally replaced Indian in legal and formal contexts outside of the Indian Act to inclusively refer to First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples collectively.<p>In the US, American Indian, Indian, and Native American are all used. Among younger indians NDN, and Skins are popular endonyms. These terms probably should not be used by those who are not Indian themselves though unless they have been given the go ahead, any more than one would use the term &quot;homeboy&quot; inappropriately.<p>In both US and Canada indians generally prefer the names of their nation when dealing with issues specific to a particular nation or their own culture. But there is also a need for a term to distinguish indigenous peoples of the americas collectively, hence Indian, American Indian, West Indian, and First Nations.<p>Why do we use an english word? Because there are hundreds of different indigenous american languages represented. English is now a commonality in the US and when we use the term we often do so when we find ourselves speaking the English language to someone. Historically, there was no one term used by all nations that had the same sort of meaning. Many of our native languages don&#x27;t use any term exactly like &quot;indian&quot; in meaning. However, in many native languages of what is now called the United States, our own word to collectively refer to the original peoples of Turtle Island, distinguishing us from the invaders and occupiers (sometimes called white men), is red man, red skin, red person. So that would be the most appropriate sort of term were we to use something with an indigenous perspective. Unfortunately, these days there are some activists claiming these traditional concepts are bad. So it is quite common to find whites tell us that redskin is racist, to tell us that indian is wrong, and to tell us that we are all natives, including them, the illegal alien white occupiers of and squatters upon our sovereign lands.<p>As far as the term &quot;Indian&quot; is applied to the many various peoples groups east of the Indus River Valley, that term used with them is a european construct as well. It was not used by people in that area to describe themselves until european colonialists and occupiers arrived and promoted the term. So to say it is correctly applied to people from that region, but not to us is a claim that comes from historical ignorance.",1451786184

At least since the 1980&#x27;s it&#x27;s been known that functional programming can be considered the logical basis of all of math [0].  A hardliner might even say that the notion that all math is functional programming goes back to the 1920s with Brouwer.<p>In particular, optimization, being a branch of math, is itself a type of functional programming.  Similarly, neural networks are functional programs.  Programming with differentiable functions as a field on its own goes back at least as far as the 1960s.  Closely related ideas like algebraic topology go back to the 1890s (this would be programming with continuous functions rather than differentiable).<p>The language of type theory is typically the province of computer science.  The corresponding language in math is category theory.  There are a few mathematicians who have been working on a categorical theory of neural networks. But this is pretty far from a mainstream research area.<p>Perhaps with people like Colah and Dalrymple pointing out these connections from a more applied point of view, these ideas will pick up steam.<p>[0] There is are technical caveats here that aren&#x27;t interesting when talking about math that can be done on computers.",1451786030

It&#x27;s common knowledge; it&#x27;s beyond being a trope and basically a synonym. But then somehow a large part of the population still cares about what politicians have to say.

All it cares about is supply and demand.<p>If people want food, and nobody is growing it, but you have a surplus of welders and nobody wanting steelwork done, of course the farmer is going to make more money. Farming is more valuable than welding, regardless of training.<p>The training itself is not a cost center. It is a barrier to entry to providing goods and services in the exact same way possession of seeds and land to plant them in is a barrier to farming. If there is not enough market demand for welders to make people train to be welders over farmers that is not a tragedy, it is an optimization of the economy.<p>The economy is the will of all the money in the system. Albeit its not the will of the people, but thats because people are not equal in wealth. But its a strong reflection of what is <i>worth</i> being done, because money would not trend towards something that is not beneficial.<p>And sane progressive taxes wouldn&#x27;t be disicentivizing welding over farming - if people stopped training to weld because of reduced profit potential because of taxation, the demand for welders will go up to compensate. Not all of it, but your losses are counterbalanced by any sticky demand.<p>Additionally, almost anyone arguing for taxation today better be doing it as an equalizer of people. If you are being taxed as a welder it means you have a baseline to fall back on in case of a dramatic oversupply of your skills, so rather than being destitute and homeless you just have to downsize your standard of living.

But weird taxes are very hard to get right.<p>You can basically order taxes by how progressive they are. The least progressive is a head tax; everybody pays a fixed dollar amount every year, income and consumption irrelevant. Next is a flat tax; some universally fixed percentage of total income or consumption. After that it isn&#x27;t really a straight line: Luxury taxes, property tax, graduated income tax, etc.<p>The problem with everything more progressive than the flat tax is they heavily induce tax avoidance and often hit the wrong target. If you tax cars with big engines then wealthy people start buying trucks with big engines. If you tax trucks with big engines you end up hitting working class people. If you tax real estate then rich people invest in the stock market and working class people can&#x27;t afford a home. If making more than $250K/year brings you into a very high tax bracket then people find all kinds of deductions and tax losses to take, or arrange for their $1M/year compensation to be paid as $200K each to yourself, your spouse and your three children. And so it goes.<p>The trick is to stop trying to outsmart people. The problem is the least avoidable tax, collecting the same dollar amount from everyone, is very, very regressive. But all we have to do to make a very, very progressive tax is invert the sign. Have the government <i>pay</i> everybody a fixed dollar amount every year. Basic income. If you pay for it with a flat consumption tax, which is the next least avoidable, the flat tax is more progressive than the head tax that the basic income is the inverse of, so you can make it however progressive you want just by changing the amount of the basic income. Then there is no tax avoidance to be had anywhere, no argument about what should be taxed or not, and everyone pays their share.<p>> Are you also suggesting a high estate tax, so that you&#x27;re encouraged to spend or invest it instead of building up wealth for your family?<p>&quot;Invest&quot; and &quot;building up wealth for your family&quot; are synonyms. Estate taxes are silly. It&#x27;s the same problem with separating owners from their businesses. Then the companies become incorporeal diffusely-owned soulless sociopathic conglomerates.

Imagine that software is an innovation akin to assembly lines.  If you started a company in 1840 that used assembly lines, you were going into a very specific industry: textiles.  If you started a company in 1890 that used assembly lines, it could be one of dozens of industries: textiles, steel, oil, tobacco, meatpacking, etc.  If you started a company in 1930 that <i>didn&#x27;t</i> use assembly lines, you were insane and destined for failure.<p>What&#x27;s happened, historically, is that as a technology diffuses into new ways of doing things, old industries simply die out, and then the new industry differentiates into replacements for it.  Specialized production in the middle ages was divided into guilds (many of which are family names now): you had smiths, cobblers, bakers, butchers, weavers, etc.  When the industrial revolution happened, there was simply &quot;industry&quot;; it was only later that this differentiated into the steel industry to replace smiths, the meatpacking industry to replace butchers, the textile industry to replace weavers, etc.<p>Similarly, when software got started in the 50s, there was only the &quot;software industry&quot;.

Yes, we know in fact that economy is not zero sum game. But economic inequality is not generated by chair makers that gain an advantage over those who don&#x27;t make chairs. Economic inequality happens because the owners of chair factories (who, are not, the chair makers) get to own both the factory and the chairs that chair makers make. Hence, while the chair makers get a salary to support themselves, the owners accumulate the surplus value of the chair producing business allowing them to expand their business, acquire more assets and, too, influence politics to turn the game in favour of capital instead of labour. This is too a simplistic metaphor, but hey, it&#x27;s at least a bit closer to reality than PG&#x27;s view of the world.<p>Of course, he is a venture capitalist, not a chair maker. His way of living is extracting surplus of founders that in turn extract surplus of engineers and other workers and contractors that support their businesses. He is in the business of selling ever increasing inequality.<p>This PG article is pure ideology. Ideological class war. It&#x27;s a hoot--a network of fallacies building some sort of implausible moral self-justification. PG, you are not a wild animal in a room of hunters. It&#x27;s more like you are the hunter, and this is a bait that we won&#x27;t bite.<p>I&#x27;m sure he would argue that my chair makers are exploited only because they are not smart enough to start their own chair making business. His utopia is one in which everyone is an entrepreneur--a CEO or a VC. I wonder who makes chairs in that world (if it&#x27;s machines, someone has to keep the machines running). See, not everyone can be a winner.  It&#x27;s not about killing the rich.  It&#x27;s about making sure that those that lose in the game--who are in fact, too, valuable and indispensable to society--have a chance to a decent and realized life in dignity.<p>But even in a legal and political system that are very much (and increasingly) biased towards capital, I&#x27;ve seen coops, foundations, institutions and other forms of sustainable and non-exploitative businesses that succeed and provide real value pushing the game out of the zero sum. We can also see this in the libre and open source world--it&#x27;s an outcry from software makers to collaborate on producing value in a way that they still own (instead of the proprietary firms that they work for). It provides collectively a leverage to our society that very few SV startups can claim to.  In a way, in this other utopia, everyone is as well a business owner.  A business owner and a maker, organized in the democratic networks of both competition and cooperation.  No VC&#x27;s needed though.  Sorry Paul.",1451784665

I hope nobody passively accepts this as an accurate account of social, economic, or governmental history from the Great Depression, through WWII, the mid-20th century, through to today.<p>Perhaps a ycombinator readership can appreciate a telling example of the problems is in Graham&#x27;s account of IBM&#x27;s decision not to exclusively license PC-DOS.   Per Graham, this &quot;must have seemed a safe move at the time.  No other computer manufacturer had ever been able to outsell them. What difference did it make if other manufacturers could offer DOS too?   The result of that miscalculation was an explosion of inexpensive PC clones. Microsoft now owned the PC standard, and the customer. And the microcomputer business ended up being Apple vs Microsoft.&quot;<p>OK, first, every indication is that IBM sought to deliberately create an explosion of inexpensive PC clones -- and that they were better off for it.<p>Briefly, IBM made a strategic decision that their position would be better if personal computers were a commodity with competitive suppliers rather than an artificial monopoly like Apple products.   IBM achieved this aim.  Competition meant that PC hardware margins were low, therefore IBM was ultimately better off letting other people make sell them.   For years, this was a harsh blow to Apple which thrashed badly after the PC took off.<p>Second, it is misleading to say that &quot;Microsoft now owned the PC standard, and the customer.&quot;<p>Microsoft has heavyweight influence but does not quite own &quot;the PC standard&quot;.   More to the point, figurative &quot;ownership&quot; of that standard is not a particularly valuable asset.   The &quot;standard&quot; is the definition of a competitive commodity.   Competition is hot.  Therefore nobody &quot;owns&quot; the standard enough to exclude competing manufacturers in any significant way.   Nobody &quot;owns&quot; the standard enough to extract significant rent on it.<p>Microsoft <i>did</i> gain a monopoly on DOS (then Windows) rents in the deal but (a) There does not seem to be any way IBM itself could have kept those rents while still making the PC a commodity;  (b) Microsoft&#x27;s rents on DOS and its control of what is in DOS have never once hurt IBM.  (c) Microsoft&#x27;s creation of a vast market of developers targeting DOS then Windows platforms has only helped IBM.<p>In short, Graham&#x27;s snapshot of that bit of history is just plain counter-factual.   I hope careful readers will look pretty skeptically on his accounts of &quot;socialism&quot;, economic management during WWII (which was widely understood at the time to be fascist, not socialist), the typical experience of 20th century employment (not nearly as described), his armchair sociology....",1451784015

That kind of change though must also be culturally accepted since a lot of effort goes into separating public education from market forces.<p>Point is, the jobs that we could not send overseas have tremendous pressure on them as a result to be absolved entirely by AI, robotics, and software.

Here is an example of the Baumol Effect:<p>As improving technology makes computer scientists more productive they will receive higher salaries in the business world.  Meanwhile, computer scientist teachers in  academia may not see similar productive gains (they still can only teach X number of students a semester).  Nonetheless, universities must increase computer scientist teacher pay to prevent them from leaving academia for the business world.<p>In the context of PG&#x27;s essay, he is saying that high pay for entrepreneurs forces companies to pay competitive salaries:<p>>anyone who could get rich by creating wealth on their own account will have to be paid enough to prevent them from doing it.<p>If Mr. Garret, or others, disagree with this assertion they should attack it directly.

And fundamental ideas like these are often -- in hindsight -- revealed to be pretty old; you can trace their lineage and formation across papers, talks, and books. Many people in the field, with a good measure of &quot;conceptual agility&quot;, will get this quickly and be able to discuss at length. Not to detract any credit from individual discoverers: they are absolutely critical for the quantized improvement of ideas; often a single person will move science forward in ways the rest of the world could not. And sometimes it is many people that do. A constructive memetic environment is good for both. (it is unfortunate that Credit is THE scientific currency today; it interferes negatively...)<p>No doubt colah&#x27;s excellent blog post dives much deeper than this essay, but please note that this was wrtten for Edge.org&#x27;s <a href=""http://edge.org/annual-questions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edge.org/annual-questions</a> book, for a general audience, with very high level perspective, with very little space, and without the ability to get technical. Don&#x27;t pit them against each other! They complement!<p>By the way, for one interesting example of the &quot;conceptual agility&quot; of scientists at the very edge, check out this interesting story about Feynman -- from a David Deutsch interview (with Sam Harris) -- in which Feynman derives months of Deutsch&#x27;s work in a few minutes (listen for ~5 min):<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J21QuHrIqXg&t=6524"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J21QuHrIqXg&t=6524</a>  (1:48:44 - 1:52:40)<p>Scientists&#x27; minds are well primed to understand, derive, and formulate ideas -- they are super fertile memetic environments. And what&#x27;s more-- they have the epistemic filters to annihilate untruths and converge on scientific knowledge (the best explanation not yet falsified). In math (inc. computer science), it&#x27;s even better because we study and manipulate the objects themselves, not data from measurements of the things. The formulation, derivation, convergence, remixing, (and so on) of ideas is much, much faster.<p>Knowing both colah and davidad, I confidently assert they are both among the most brilliant young scientists alive.
