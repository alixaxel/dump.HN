It was a flight to some rural airport then a long drive. In general the advice is if you want to see how people live, it is best to know someone. Some places are prohibited to go into if you are by yourself.<p>Also, as you might imagine you might not like everything you see you there. The beauty of the terrain was stunning, but a lot of issues like poverty, drugs, drinking and such (even though alcohol I understand is prohibited on the reservation, there are places selling it around the border).",1451797159

It is dead simple to check that they have the same size and iterate over both simultaneously where needed.  And the best part is, for code that does not actually require both pieces of information, you can pass one of the lists and pretend that the other does not exist.  Code that only knows how to visit values only has to deal with values and not weird hybrid name/value elements.<p>Seriously, <i>always</i> try the simpler thing first.

The hugely wealth-creating SF bay area is one of the most unequal places in the world.<p>I think redistribution of wealth is absolutely necessary to reduce poverty and increase average quality of life. Sadly, I don&#x27;t have much faith in this happening due to the argument that selfishly motivated wealth-creators or rent-seekers will flock to wherever taxes them the least.",1451797136

10829565,comment,10826053,10828233,0,0,theluketaylor,,,"I can see a lot of cases where someone gets stuck in the queue and is never served.  It&#x27;s quite possibly (and even likely) last in first out provides the lowest average wait time but it would come at the expense of the outliers.  First in first out is the standard for lining up with people because it provides the lowest deviation from the average.  It&#x27;s the most fair system for everyone involved because you wait from the back to the front just like everyone else, no special cases.<p>Optimizing FIFO is easy as well: just go when other people are less likely to be there.  There is incentive to shop for christmas Dec 1 since Dec 23 the mall is a mad house.  I did my grocery shopping when I worked graveyard shift at 2 AM on my weekend with 24 hr grocery store since the place was deserted.  I stroll out for lunch at 11:30 AM and beat the rush at the food trucks.  Not everyone has the flexibility to shop at 2 AM or shift lunch time but for those who do there is incentive to take advantage.  Optimizing LIFO is also easy but awful for those around you.  There is no more incentive to find a low volume time; just rock up and stroll past the suckers who tried to beat the rush but just didn&#x27;t quite do it.<p>Some common things people line up for:<p>Low volume shop (ex furniture) - Here you&#x27;d never wait that long to pay simply because there are not that many customers.  If the cashier is busy customers simply linger longer around the merchandise and wait for availability.  No need to make any changes<p>High volume shop (ex supermarket) - These stores have a steady stream of customers so would be the most likely to get someone stuck in the queue for a long time.  If there is a spike in customer numbers for 1/2 hr but then a very steady stream of shoppers for the rest of the day someone could be waiting hours for the queue to dwindle low enough to clear the spike.  The steady stream takes up the full cashier capacity leaving the spike waiting for service while their food spoils.  If the rate of customer arrival exceeds cashier volume (as it often does during busy times) some people are going to wait in that queue until the rush subsides.<p>general admission event - Here people pay the same amount for tickets and in FIFO are able to pay extra with their queuing time (since time is money) to indicate how much a good seat is worth to them.  In LIFO you would try to arrive as late as possible but the venue can only be filled so quickly so you&#x27;d get the reverse of the stadium emptying problem.  When everyone gets up to leave at end the exits become a massive bottleneck and everything slows down.  If being late means you skip to the front of the queue everyone will arrive late and the event won&#x27;t start on time since no one will be in their seats when the event is supposed to begin.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt there is some math that would indicate average wait times would go down with FIFO but queueing isn&#x27;t about minimizing the average, it&#x27;s about minimizing the extremes.  Often minimizing the extremes is at the expense of the average.  A O(logn) queue sucks if the worst case is O(n^4).  Better to have O(n) and fewer stabbings.",1451797115

10829550,comment,10822019,10827779,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"Performing the task of weightlifting is incredibly different than performing the task of programming. Much evidence suggests that programmers perform better solo because they can more easily reach states of psychological flow, and because they are less inhibited by social interactions which modulate certain parts of our thinking and can inhibit creativity, etc. At the very least, this is more highly true of introverted personality styles, and creating mandates for policies like pair programming is extremely insensitive (almost to a point of blatant discrimination) towards people with differing personality and learning styles.<p>For me personally, I can&#x27;t learn <i>anything</i> from other people <i>saying</i> stuff about it audibly. I <i>have</i> to read documentation or code. I am the weirdo who actually reads my car&#x27;s maintenance manual to figure out how to change spark plugs or use the jack to lift the car when replacing a tire. Someone can tell me how to change a tire all day long and it just doesn&#x27;t help <i>at all</i>. I even played quarterback on my high school football team and even at that I had to actually read books and biomechanics papers about the throwing motion before I really improved. I went to football camps and everything and it just did no good. For me, I really only absorb information when I literally tune out all audio (<i>especially the sound of people talking</i>) and read.<p>I suppose I serve as something of a counter-example, then. Just because beginners in weightlifting (or any given activity) benefit most from fast, in-person feedback does not at all mean that beginners in some other activity (like programming) will also benefit from that kind of feedback.<p>I&#x27;ve also worked in high pair-programming environments, in one case with a group of other experienced, extremely talented engineers, and in another case with a larger number of average to mediocre engineers.<p>In both cases, across the board, pairing slowed us down and led to worker dissatisfaction. The few times when pairing came in handy were those cases when a person needed to begin working on a section of code or a subsystem that someone else had explicit experience with. Then, pairing them briefly (for, say, half a day) to force the novice to get up to speed quickly and have an &quot;oracle&quot; nearby was really helpful, but after about the 4 hour mark it just started slowing both people down, caused the novice to learn too slowly, and focused hyper amounts of attention on issues that wouldn&#x27;t have needed to be brought up if the novice instead focused on solving their own problems and boiling down their issue list into a smaller, asynchronous list of just the most urgent needs.<p>And, truly, the only reason that those first four or so hours of pairing worked at all is that the documentation for the code was poor. If the exact questions and answers that were discussed during pairing had instead been turned into an internal StackOverflow and/or an internal quick start guide, it would have helped far more people get up to speed far more quickly than pairing, while only costing the senior dev a single up front cost.<p>Pairing is the definition of an activity that doesn&#x27;t scale, and is arguably less beneficial than well written user guides + StackOverflow-like tools that allow for <i>documenting</i> the learning process.",1451796585

Because these goals lie fundamentally in tension with each other, the same problems predictably occur with long time use of an issue tracker.<p>Issue trackers are like shopping lists without price tags. if you imagine an Amazon Wishlist with all the things you want to buy in life, it&#x27;s not hard to imagine the same graph appearing. Somewhere mixed into all those items is a ferrari and also the washer you need to stop your tap from leaking. And, of course, the list is going to get exponentially longer as time goes on, even as you check items off. But the reason we don&#x27;t get stressed about our ever expanding wants list is because price serves as an intuitive gut check over priority and, as long as we see our personal living standards improve, we don&#x27;t care that we can never fulfil all our wants and we don&#x27;t bother applying &quot;won&#x27;t buy&quot; or &quot;item does not exist in real life&quot; tags on our list. (this is an analogy, ok. Please don&#x27;t try and fight the hypothetical on this, I&#x27;m aware our economic wants are significantly more complicated than that).<p>One of the ideas I&#x27;ve been tinkering with is to treat issue tracking less like a todo list and more like a storefront. A todo list with ever increasing entries is stressful experience, a storefront with expanding inventory is not. Items would have a base cost associated with it and a &quot;shipping cost&quot; so that 2 day shipping costs more than USPS ground (aka: Whenever we can get to it). External clients get to create items on the storefront, set the price and the shipping costs using some kind of artificial currency and engineering gets to figure out which orders to fulfil and in what order to maximize revenue.<p>Of course, to paraphrase jwz, &quot;You have a problem and you think &quot;Oh, I know, I&#x27;ll solve it with an artificial currency&quot;. Now you have two problems&quot;.<p>Still, I think it&#x27;s worthwhile getting back to the foundations and think of what an issue tracker does in the context of software development and whether there&#x27;s a better thing that could serve the same purpose.",1451795964

To your question 1) If someone is already offering same product and paid customers - ask yourself - do they have 100% market share? If not, whom are they missing? Can you reach those whom they are missing? To your question 2) If you just came up with the idea, how do you know the market is thinly spread? To your question 3) Those are a very tiny tiny tiny tiny slice of all the majority of SaaS products. Is this something you are well and truly interested in? If not, go back to your question 1 and figure out who has the most customers.<p>worth watching -> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDXJ6bMkMY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDXJ6bMkMY</a>",1451794524
