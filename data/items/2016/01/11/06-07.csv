In the case of something like Babel, it can be both. There are just two interfaces to the same functionality. The errors he saw with Babel are obviously bad, but that seems to be a symptom of implementation.<p>Dropping configuration in favor of convention is a dangerous suggestion. Magic is great until it breaks, and when that happens you&#x27;ve created an opaque mess for the end user.

10879236,comment,10872852,10879171,0,0,pron,,,"> You go to great effort to NOT make any testable predictions.<p>How do you figure? I don&#x27;t make testable predictions when I don&#x27;t have the tools to make them. I will just point out that 1. perfectly predictive models could be completely wrong in a dynamical system with feedback, and 2. that human society has been known to be such a system.<p>> This is strictly a positive (i.e., value-free) claim about the world. It&#x27;s based on your positive belief.<p>You are absolutely right. Not only have I said the exact same thing, but I even went a step further and showed how making that prediction could be right even ad infinitum. That does not, however, mean that there isn&#x27;t <i>another</i>  correct prediction and that the choice between the two isn&#x27;t ideological. Systems can (and do) have more than one stable state. I will say this again: your predictions both predict the outcome <i>and</i> determine it (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10874683"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10874683</a>).<p>I can give you an example that may make the point clearer: if society insisted that humans can&#x27;t fly, it would have been correct for a very long time. If it had insisted that pursuing such goals is wasteful, it would have been correct to this day. This isn&#x27;t mere speculation. In 1485, the sultan of the Ottoman empire forbade the printing of Arabic books (because the Arabic script is holy). That decision helped turn Arab society from the most advanced in the West in the middle ages, to a rather underdeveloped one.<p>> As for your dynamical systems verbiage, feel free to state a testable prediction.<p>That I&#x27;ve shown your math to be wrong does not mean that I have a better formula. I don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know how to predict society&#x27;s behavior with any useful accuracy, but I do know to spot the errors in your predictions. This is made easy by two facts: 1/ that identical predictions could have been made in various periods throughout history and they would have been wrong then, and 2/ that your biases are so strong and that you so insist in remaining blind to their existence and keep making the <i>same</i> wrong assumptions over and over.<p>I am truly sorry: we don&#x27;t yet know how to mathematically model society well. That, however, does not mean that we can&#x27;t study it and make some useful qualitative observations. When I studied non-linear differential equations (only ODEs, though), I was dismayed that the same could be said on much simpler models than human society, but there you have it.<p>But if you insist on <i>something</i>, here you go: if society decides to continue to bet 1, the result will be 1 until unforeseen forces change it; if, however, society decides to bet -1, the result will rather quickly converge to -1.",1452494938

10879227,comment,10877616,10878660,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"The Fed has two mandates -- its &quot;dual mandate&quot;:<p>1. Control inflation.<p>2. Manage unemployment.<p>They are, unfortunately, directly at odds.  Fighting inflation tanks the economy (that&#x27;s what Paul Volker did in the late 1970s, to tackle &quot;stagflation&quot;, and Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 2nd term hopes), and promoting employment tends to hot up inflation.<p>Over the past 8 years, the Fed (and other central bankers) have dumped unholy amounts of liquidity into the global economy. That is, they&#x27;ve been &quot;printing money&quot;, except that the Fed doesn&#x27;t actually <i>print</i> money, it simply wills it into existence. It&#x27;s done this <i>after</i> reducing its own lending rates (the prime rate) to effectively zero wasn&#x27;t sufficiently stimulating the economy.<p>It&#x27;s slightly more complex than that: the Fed distributes that money by buying &quot;assets&quot; from major banks -- it&#x27;s an auction process, but the goal of the Fed isn&#x27;t to get valuable assets[1], only to manage how that money&#x27;s introduced to the economy and keep tabs on its value by way of inflation, as I understand it.<p>For whatever the reasons, <i>inflation hasn&#x27;t actually been a problem</i>, though the reasons <i>why</i> are elusive, and several alternatives have been suggested:<p>1. The money&#x27;s gone into financial instruments, including stocks and real estate. The rise in major stock market indices and the Fed&#x27;s balance sheet (its money supply injections) pretty much exactly track one another.<p>2. It&#x27;s gone into offshore tax havens. Last numbers I&#x27;ve seen are about $7 trillion from the US, and $25-30 trillion globally, from various sources. The ICIJ and <i>The Guardian</i> have run a multi-year expose on off-shore investment havens, and other financial sources have reported on this.<p>3. Chasing other investments. Silicon Valley VC money comes from somewhere, and much of it chases start-ups whose ultimate valuation is either advertising potential, or buy-it-to-kill-the-threat-to-us (WhatsApp&#x27;s purchase by Facebook). Advertising&#x27;s terrifying because a tremendous amount of <i>it</i> is financial services -- about 40% in &quot;FIRE&quot; industries: finance, insurance, and real estate.  Pull the plug on easy money, and all three of those tailspin.<p>Which gets us to why fighting inflation is seen as such a bad thing. Usually the argument given is &quot;inflation hurts those with fixed incomes&quot;, by which most people think of the elderly on social security or pensions. But we&#x27;ve learned how to fix that: you index those systems to inflation, hence SSI&#x27;s COLA adjustment -- the cost-of-living factor that boosts Social Security payments. Who <i>really</i> get hurt by inflation are those who are holding dollar-denominated assets. Lenders.<p>That&#x27;s banks, and holders of bonds (debt), which aren&#x27;t themselves inflation adjusted. If you&#x27;ve got a home mortgage, inflation is your best friend, because it reduces the amount of your debt (in real terms) while your income increases. Banks, on the other hand, hate that, because their assets (your mortgage) <i>falls</i> in value.<p>So: the Fed is raising rates to stem inflation fears, even though inflation&#x27;s been fairly much a non-player. Probably because banks and other lenders / bondholders are getting nervous. And to give itself more maneuvering room.<p>There&#x27;s a whole bunch more in this, such as what money &quot;really&quot; is (in a functional / role sense, not the boring old fiat-vs-gold-backed debate), what, whether, why, and how economic growth is, can be extended, is justified, and is based on, and whether or not inflation is an unavoidable element of a collapsing economic system. On that last, the fate of the (specie-based) Roman denarius is quite interesting.<p>But stay tuned. Things might get interesting.<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1.

People sometimes mistakenly think that the guidelines ask for the original title to always be used, but that&#x27;s not so: see <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html</a>.<p>In this case the procedure we followed is almost a technical one. First, take out the obvious linkbait: &quot;no&quot; and &quot;your&quot;. That leaves &quot;I don&#x27;t want to configure app[s]&quot;, and that&#x27;s misleading, since the article is not about a personal desire but rather a critique in general of applications that require configuration. &quot;Don&#x27;t configure applications&quot; seemed as close to that as one could get without being either misleading or linkbait. Think of it as dropping a perpendicular from the point of the original title to the HN guideline.<p>But that&#x27;s not to say we got it right in this case, let alone always get it right.  When we do a bad job of a title, a good way to show that is by suggesting a better one, i.e. one that is more accurate and neutral. If you read HN often enough to be mad about title changes, you should be aware of how happily we accept better suggestions from users. Just please don&#x27;t suggest a title that goes back to breaking the HN guidelines, since that&#x27;s always the reason why we change them in the first place.<p>By the way, if you think we suck at editing titles, that is likely because you notice only the cases you disagree with while the other ones blend into the background. Everyone bats zero if you only count the strikes. I&#x27;m going to mark this subthread off topic now.<p>Edit: ok, let&#x27;s try &quot;A rant about application configuration&quot; instead of &quot;Don&#x27;t configure applications&quot;.",1452494125
