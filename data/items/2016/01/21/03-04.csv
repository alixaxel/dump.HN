But I will roll with your terminology for now.<p>1) Linux was a Unix-like OS for tinkerers, programmers and soon for servers. A &quot;real OS&quot; is not defined by its availability on the Desktop. And indeed I very much used it exactly because of this, because I am a tinkerer who rather runs a Server OS on his private machines, that also allows him to do most Desktop-tasks with ease.<p>2) The voice of the Desktop camp inside of Linux is not ignored, if anything, the influence is too big. Think about systemd for example. This was not a move in order to run better on Servers, this was primarily Notebook and Server focused. The year of the Linux Desktop is not something we won&#x27;t see because of evil big corporations, rather because it simply is not Linux&#x27;s DNA to be that.<p>(And side note: Because of systemd I see more and more people using *BSDs)",1453348252

Read the GPLv3, it&#x27;s a great political document, and somewhere in there there also is a software license, hidden between the lines.<p>Linus always said: He cares about the code back and otherwise not what vendors do with it. He is not in any sense one of those GNU-people about Software Freedom everywhere and for all. When the Free Software Foundation (FSF) created the GPLv3, indeed during the process, Linus already spoke out against it and said he would never ever use it[1]. He cited reasonable use-cases for which vendors have no other way than to not to give open access to devices, in part for example commercial license agreements.<p>The GPLv3 - from the perspective of the FSF - fixes some vital flaws in GPLv2, from Linus&#x27; perspective however is just too strict, forbids use-cases Linux has been used before previously and is extremely anti-business and would hurt the Linux project.<p>Whether this step of the Linux foundation is right or not, can&#x27;t say for sure, but I totally understand it. A political anti-business pro-freedom-everywhere radical who already is involved in suing some of the companies she is supposed to work with on that said board?

It mimics the hell out of OOP.<p>The component tree is a directed acyclic graph of single-inheritance relationships. Services are singletons that can be injected into any component to share state. Dirty checking follows the tree (ie the DAG) of inputs/outputs specified in the component metadata so there&#x27;s at most O(log n) comparisons per update. To make dirty checking efficient favor immutability because it&#x27;s quicker to superficially compare references than it is to deep check an entire data structure.<p>Anything that&#x27;s inherently asynchronous is handled via Rxjs observables using either a one-to-one or one-to-many publisher/subscriber model.<p>As for Angularjs. Who the hell knows? Dirty checking, crawls the graph of relationships until the dirty checker gets tired. Services are kind of like singletons, I think. Factories try to mimic the borg/prototype pattern (because, reasons...) to provide singletons that share a reference to a common closure. Who the hell knows what providers do, maybe provide an instance that acts like a static helper class? Directives are magic, really complicated and painful to use magic that preprocess the HTML, who the hell knows when.",1453346040

The annoying thing is footnote 1, where they explain that they coopted the term &quot;dataflow model&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s just plain dumb, since that word is used in so many other settings, <i>especially</i> big data settings (TensorFlow is also a dataflow system, but both the data types and model are completely different, etc.).  So I can see why someone would just dismiss it as yet another framework, sort of like how all these JavaScript frameworks that are the hot thing one year and then legacy code the next.<p>If they had used a more specific name, I think it would help the perception a lot.  The main point is batch vs streaming, which is still big pain point, and being precise about the event time vs event processing time.",1453345468

Users can buy or subscribe to these on platform market.<p>4. User information, parse heuristics, corpus ranking, etc are sent to private db setup for user. Data is requested from browser ==> user processing ==> main corpus (if not cached/get balance of non cached items) <== fetched raw data returned then processed and indexed according to users needs/algorithims then data returned to user.<p>Entire ecosystem product. You could build this.<p>Please do.",1453345251
