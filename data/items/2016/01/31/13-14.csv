It&#x27;s a two-layer (i.e. not deep) neural network that uses a relatively simple training algorithm. Yet, after 30 minutes it can learn impressive relationships between English words.

11006365,comment,11002635,11004751,0,0,uuoc,,,"> Less window management hassle.<p>Actually, no, you still have to perform the &quot;find the window&quot; function and the &quot;bring the window to the top&quot; function, for both maximized as well as non-maximized windows.  And once any given window is sized, the &#x27;management hassle&#x27; for &#x27;find and raise&#x27; is identical between both modes (maximized and non-maximized.<p>The screenshot you posted is of a Mac, so because of that I am going to assume you are using a Mac (because otherwise you would have posted a screen shot of some other OS).  This explains why you believe that window management is a hassle.<p>Mac&#x27;s window management support is on par with MSWindows window management, which is to say, they both suck for handling more than a handful of windows at once, and they both suck for doing much more than &quot;find something - bring it to the top&quot; (and even that function on both is awful as well).  Which is really sad given that Apple is the company that brought the whole multiple overlapping windows GUI model into the popular view (Apple Lisa).<p>Additionally, because you are using a Mac, I am going to assume you are likely using a Mac laptop (simply due to the sheer number of Mac laptops sold vs. Mac desktops, there is a significantly higher probability you are on a Mac laptop).  This leads directly to a second reason why you believe window management is a hassle.  On almost any touchpad/trackpad, with the current UI hooks used by Mac (and Windows as well), window management is a hassle and sucks terribly.  This is because all the UI hooks are designed around a mouse with a separate button (or buttons) that can be independently held down separately from creating mouse motion.  On any touchpad/trackpad that lacks separate mouse buttons that can be independently held down with your second hand, performing any kind of &quot;hold mouse button down while moving&quot; operation is made significantly more difficult and a major hassle.  This is due to the need to reposition your fingers on the pad to perform large movements, and the act of repositioning loses the &quot;hold button down&quot; mode, so you have to repeat the &quot;hold button down&quot; action just to reposition your fingers.  But this is not a flaw with multiple window UI&#x27;s, this is a flaw with Apple deploying a touchpad without separate buttons and failing to update the UI interface to better mesh with the physical constraints of a single touchpad without external buttons.",1454248122

Polygenic traits are just as well described by it as simple Mendelian traits. It also accommodates a range of factors like plasticity, epistasis, and gene by environment interactions that complicate the relationship between genotype and phenotype.<p>Additionally, your understanding of &quot;selfish&quot; as genes which produce defectors in cooperative scenarios is incorrect. &quot;Selfish&quot; is a metaphor to describe the fact that to be favoured by selection genes must contribute to a phenotype that increases their own propagation (to the degree that they are not constrained from doing so, and issues like linkage and pleiotropy aside).",1454247015

If you go that route then it&#x27;s just: Study mathematics or theoretical physics and then learn everything you need.<p>The problem is pulling that off.

An idea that I think would make the world a lot more efficient.<p>I really think that there are applications all over the place for automated optimization. This is a common, recurring problem, that there are basically no tools for. And I believe a simple tool could be made that even an idiot could use for their weird problem.<p>Imagine you are have a bunch of parameters that need optimized. Like for a machine learning model. You could plug those parameters into this tool, and it could suggest the optimal next test to perform. Or if you are designing an airplane wing, or a chemical mixture, or a food recipe, etc. A ton of things have parameters that can be optimized, but there are no simple tools for doing it.<p>Of course that doesn&#x27;t fit into the YC research model. It&#x27;s more of a startup idea, or even better an open source tool.",1454245235
