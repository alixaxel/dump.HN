At the moment Common Lisp is just my hobby language, but also the language in which I invest most of my programming/learning time. I&#x27;m able to program in a few mainstream languages, but I want to have one language where I really know the tricks and shortcuts.<p>Getting a job here, where I would program in CL is nearly impossible.

Or even if they want like a Tag Heuer (for the gold model).<p>Maybe because AppleWatch will be worth little as soon as AppleWatch 2 is released. It happened with iPhone 1 and iPad 1 too. The second generation was so much more powerful (hardware specs). iPad 2 is still supported, whereas iPad 1 cannot even play HD videos and is stuck with iOS 5. We can assume AppleWatch 2 will have a far better hardware and can run apps in a better way while consuming less battery, so that the battery will last longer.<p>Traditional mechanical watches will work for many decades with some love and care, some of them are of very high precision and quality and already hundreds of years old.<p>The next problem is, I don&#x27;t need a smartphone and a watch. Ideally I would want one device, a smart watch that can do everything incl. cell modem and last for a few days and be as small and lightweight as a traditional mechanical watch. We all know that this will take another few years. So for now I am happy with a smartphone and don&#x27;t use a watch at all.",1454237569

What can we do about this situation?  We can either hive off into separate bubbles, where we rely on the &quot;moderation&quot; of like-minded friends to remove &quot;incorrect&quot; arguments of the opposition, or we come together and make an effort to talk to each other productively and understand each other.  The second option is _really difficult_, particularly in anonymous internet forums.

The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia&#x27;s terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.[83]<p>It has been argued that two documents seized from the Sarajevo office of the Benevolence International Foundation prove that the name was not simply adopted by the mujahid movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term &quot;al-Qaeda&quot;.[84]<p>Former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as &quot;the database&quot;, and originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.[85] In April 2002, the group assumed the name Qa&#x27;idat al-Jihad, which means &quot;the base of Jihad&quot;. According to Diaa Rashwan, this was &quot;apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt&#x27;s al-Jihad (Egyptian Islamist Jihad, or EIJ) group, led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.&quot;[86]",1454236150
