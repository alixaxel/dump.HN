For example, Der Spiegel and The Intercept  recently posted some documents from that pile, showing how the US hacked Israeli feeds from jet fighters to monitor possible attacks against Iran. The original piece was extremely balanced, highlighting the conflicted relationship and conflict on policy choices and overall strategies.<p>The Guardian picked it up with a piece that was very much pro-Israel, drumming up support for Israeli hawks (at a time when they are extremely isolated on the international stage).<p>Whenever this sort of material enters the discourse, you have to be very careful if you want to avoid other people framing it in the &quot;wrong&quot; way.

There is a feeling of superfluousness when one realizes they cannot contribute to the forefront of culture, as I feel depressed when I feel I will never have enough programming skill to get a job on this planet and will just be a human pet my whole life. Nevertheless, I don&#x27;t think aliens will ever show up. Human desires are ultimately illogical and if &quot;cultures&quot; &quot;advance&quot; enough I think they will disappear like the Dwemer, they will no longer be able to cross the is-ought divide except perhaps to desire survival - perfect adaptation to the environment. But perfect adaptation to the environment implies the antithesis of power: it means your being is completely determined not from anything inside but the outside. This means becoming invisible, becoming at one with the universe, becoming the laws of physics themselves. Just imagine if we got the technology to install into the brain like &quot;whoa I know kung-fu&quot; in The Matrix. People could be backed up on github. Individuality would die out and most people would feel horrifically superfluous. &quot;Civilization&quot; might have drastically reduced desire for human bodies, especially combined with desire engineering (one could remove survival instincts and bring world population down to the 500 million many elites already want [including an editorial in my local paper today]). But what is the end of such a society? I think space exploration would be pointless if one had the computational ability to imagine whole worlds and keep population down to a steady state except maybe one nearby planet in case of an asteroid. One might engineer away the wanderlust when trying to abolish pain and depression and all suffering.",1454210529
