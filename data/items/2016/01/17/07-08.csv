It&#x27;s the degrading effect it has on the rest of a discussion. Once bystanders see that it&#x27;s ok to throw concern for the truth out the window and optimize for indignation, every standard drops. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true that sharks go crazy when they smell blood, but that&#x27;s what this effect reminds me of. It seems to be getting worse, and the Principle of Charity might be a rampart against it.",1453017470

However it&#x27;s aggravating that in every post about Rust which raises valid criticisms about the language (in this case having to do with the ease with which C allows you to do low level programming), those associated with the Rust project leap to its defense and suggest that Rust&#x27;s decisions are right for every situation.<p>Just because Rust can&#x27;t easily do things that C can doesn&#x27;t make it a bad language, but it does mean that, shockingly, there are somethings that Rust isn&#x27;t as well positioned for as other languages are.<p>Similarly, there are things that C is bad at. Both at the high level and the low level. At the low level it hides too much of the CPU&#x27;s features so for some very low level programming you need to drop to assembly. At the high level it has obvious deficiencies, many of which Rust addresses, but for interfacing with the actual hardware it is tough to beat C in terms of convenience.",1453017413

TCP/IP&#x27;s primary design point was avoiding centralized network failure in a nuclear war, so you can&#x27;t strongly claim that it is responsible for heirarchies (i.e. Star) we see in modern topology -- that&#x27;s likely due to other forces like cost optimization (eg branching structure is a common feature of such optimizations).<p>Now this isn&#x27;t to say that TCP/IP is efficient for all decentralized networks. And I think there are quite a few points that make mesh networks challenging... But you could also argue that for the interplanetary network protocols as well, so I think it&#x27;s not so much the concept of decentralization, it&#x27;s more the specific constraints of mesh or interplanetary that are unsuitable for TCP/IP.<p>Regarding the quote:<p>This argument seems to be partly based on economies of scale and how they are currently applied. But internet economies can be platforms as well as products.<p>Platforms have a strong tendency towards monopolies (i.e., Apple App Store, Uber, VISA). But even in platforms, they may centralize wealth by treating customers as resources, or they may distribute wealth by treating them as partners.<p>As we race towards the so-called &quot;gig&quot; economy, I think a key differentiator in platform providers will be the extent to which they grant power to their users as partners in creating value.<p>This changes the classical idea of monopoly quite a bit as the old concept merely controlled a market for maximum exploitation of its consumers.  If consumers are given back some power in terms of profit sharing, content creation, value creation, the Internet could be an extremely vitalizing force.<p>You see this in spates: Etsy, Steam, Heroku.<p>Maybe greater collaboration will be necessary to drive increasing efficiencies. The key point might be &quot;central management&quot; vs &quot;empowerment&quot; rather than platform, product, monopoly etc.",1453017224

I get incredibly irritated with this naïve revisionism.<p>I spent a lot of my child hood seeking out broken and junk electronics anywhere it could be found, including dumpster diving behind the high school and businesses. One of the opening scenes in Robert Cringely&#x27;s Triumph of the Nerds is most instructive. In the first few minutes, you&#x27;re introduced to a 10 year old kid named Edwin Chin. Take a good long look at that kid, imagine yourself being back at that time and ask yourself, &quot;What adult, except an adult nerd, would ever encourage any kid, male or female, to be like Edwin?&quot;. I was like Edwin myself.<p>The number of people that I knew that were adults interested in computers and technology was exactly one, Murali Mani, and I lived in Chappaqua, NY, which was the very model of a privileged well educated community. This was a community where many people worked at IBM&#x27;s headquarters at the time, but every person I knew that worked for IBM, were suits. The successful people at IBM were not the engineers, but the suits. No one encouraged you to be an engineer. Everyone encouraged you to be interested in being a doctor, a lawyer or a suit. Engineering really only started to become a desirable career around the first dot-com boom. And even in the first dot-com boom, mostly founding engineers did very well. After the founding engineers, suits still took home a lot of the winnings. It was only post-dot-com bubble that engineering truly became a desirable career that people encouraged and supported you in pursuing instead of pushing you to be a doctor, lawyer or suit.<p>Beyond Murali, exactly no one encouraged me to get involved with computers. I eventually moved to Raleigh, NC and went to a small private school, that like most private schools, preps you for university. Tech and engineering was never a focus even when I graduated in 2000 at the height of the first bubble. Guy or girl, you were not encouraged to go into tech at all. You would be more likely to be encouraged to play a musical instrument, do art or some sport than do anything tech related.<p>The revisionists really need to spend some time reading Meredith Patterson&#x27;s &quot;When Nerds Collide&quot; essay, since most of their real beef is not with hacker culture, but with bro culture that became a part of tech at best a few years after the first dot com bubble.<p><a href=""https://medium.com/@maradydd/when-nerds-collide-31895b01e68c#.9v8oka2x5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@maradydd/when-nerds-collide-31895b01e68c...</a><p>Another thing worth considering about computing history is that that there is a huge huge huge difference between computing pre mini-computer and post-mini computer.
