10918205,comment,10917501,10918005,0,0,manigandham,,,"I think there might be some misunderstanding here so I&#x27;ll try to be more specific:<p>I did mention network level blocking in the article but just didn&#x27;t have enough space to cover all the details regarding how it works in apps. This is why I used the word &quot;mostly&quot; for those apps. Even network blocks can be overcome though when using closed platform apps like Apple News which runs it&#x27;s own iAds over the same secure backend. However, thanks for the feedback, I&#x27;ll definitely strive to make things clearer in future content.<p>As far as network blocking, my comments were regarding 2 issues: how widespread this type of blocking is and how in-depth the blocking will occur.<p>I do agree that it will increase in usage but as soon as it gets to any major sized organization, the issues of net neutrality/censorship might come up which is why I think it will remain used by individuals with home networks and small businesses rather than large enterprises and network carriers. Considering the use of adblockers is almost perfectly correlated to the ease of installation, I just don&#x27;t see widespread adoption here of router/network level blocking given the expertise and effort required. Even if the entire HN audience uses it, that&#x27;s negligible part of the entire online audience.<p>In regards to the blocking depth, network blocking still works the same as most blocking does now, by using domain/dns block lists. This opens up the possibility for embedded advertising content to come through and while I understand that HTML can be parsed and edited, it&#x27;s a far more challenging to implement and maintain that kind of filtering reliably. Domain block lists also remove the vast majority of ads so going further in page processing is what I meant as very diminishing returns for the amount of effort involved.",1453002957

If we were developing some alternative method of transport, why would we reserve the entire cross section of current tunnels for single occupancy vehicles? As demonstrated by the Tube itself, much higher densities could be achieved, even with private vehicles, either by having multiple people per vehicle or by using smaller vehicles that didn&#x27;t require as much space and could run alongside others.<p>Of course density isn&#x27;t the only thing that matters. Consider that the average speed of an Underground train is about 20mph. A fit person can <i>run</i> faster than a Tube train moves over short distances.[1] Clearly if you had a system where loading and unloading happened without blocking the main tunnels, significantly higher speeds could be achieved over the kinds of distances a typical passenger might be travelling.<p>[1] No, really! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH_Z8Ghuq6E</a>",1453002408

Modula had DEVICE as a keyword, and you could define structures as being in device space.<p>That&#x27;s a useful language feature for low-level programming. It tells the compiler that the address space is special - it can change without help from the program.  Other features of device space can include that the write width can matter (some registers have to be written as a single byte, world, or double word) and some registers are read-only or write-only.  The compiler needs to know this stuff. Especially because Rust makes some strong assumptions about memory.<p>Rust probably needs to know about both device registers and memory shared with peripherals to operate at this level.  For the blinky light program it doesn&#x27;t matter; for the network stack it matters a lot.",1452999680

A call to Trigger kicks off the `listen` function in a background thread, which accesses a map and walks over a list of callbacks. If you then call On() or Off() immediately after Trigger, that map and/or list gets modified while `listen` is walking it. This is a serious problem.<p>It&#x27;s great that there&#x27;s tests, but all of the tests follow the same pattern: On and then Trigger. It&#x27;s the reverse order that&#x27;s busted.",1452999669
