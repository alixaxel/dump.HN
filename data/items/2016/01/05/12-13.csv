10842990,comment,10836236,10840734,0,0,DonHopkins,,,"No, it doesn&#x27;t play nicely with HTML or XML. It&#x27;s arbitrarily and pointlessly incompatible with HTML for no good reason, which is a huge easily avoided mistake, that makes me question the judgement of the people who designed (and evangelize) Angular 2. Please see my other posting about that. [1]<p>My simple question that nobody&#x27;s been able to answer yet: Name any benefits of the broken Angular 2 template syntax, that couldn&#x27;t easily be achieved with a non-incompatible, HTML-friendly syntax.<p>The &quot;Databinding with Web Components&quot; design document [2] makes the dubious claim that &quot;The HTML attribute name of a databound attribute must be escaped in some way.&quot;<p>That is precisely what namespaces are for, so why not simply use namespaces for the purpose they were meant to be used, the same way any well designed standards compliant template languages like Genshi [3] does, instead of inventing a new, non-standard, incompatible syntax?<p>The entire point of the design of the XML namespace prefix syntax was so that it was compatible with XML syntax. Why do the Angular 2 designers think that was such a bad idea?<p>I&#x27;m not the only person to point this out and have it brushed off and ignored by the Angular 2 team.<p>&quot;Regardless, it is inappropriate for the angular team to take a hard anti-xml stance.&quot; [4]<p>&quot;I wonder why ngnl presentation and current docs about templates still promoting []()# as parts of new syntax, when opening post in this thread contains &#x27;element.setAttribute(&#x27;[foo]&#x27;, &#x27;exp&#x27;) does not work&#x27; and, especially &#x27;SVG requires valid XML and []()# is not valid XML.&#x27; If these problems are solved somehow and we just don&#x27;t know - please let us know.&quot; [5]<p>&quot;Given the lack of xml/SVG compatibility, I would say that the []()# syntax simply fails to meet the constraints, and should be eliminated altogether in favor of the prefix proposal.&quot; [6]<p>&quot;Please don&#x27;t break HTML syntax :( I love Angular because I can write templates for it in any templating language like SLIM or HAML or Jade (you can&#x27;t do it in Ember or React, for example). Introducing non-standard characters in attributes makes templating languages unusable (as well as syntax coloring and introspection in IDE).&quot; [7]<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10842902"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10842902</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kpuR512G1b0D8egl9245OHaG0cFh0ST0ekhD_g8sxtI/edit#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kpuR512G1b0D8egl9245OHaG...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://genshi.edgewall.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://genshi.edgewall.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/133#issuecomment-66803057"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/133#issuecomment-6...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/133#issuecomment-74645366"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/133#issuecomment-7...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/133#issuecomment-74791116"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/133#issuecomment-7...</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/133#issuecomment-61248467"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/133#issuecomment-6...</a>",1451998775

A typical server would be running on over ethernet rather than WiFi and on server board with support for remote management (eg IPMI or iLO) which would have mitigated the VNC issues you were having (though anecdotally I&#x27;ve never had any problems running X + VNC on a headless Linux box on the rare occasions I&#x27;ve needed to)<p>But arguments about VNC aside, the vast majority of the time you don&#x27;t want nor need a GUI running on a server to begin with. Aside maybe some game servers, any Linux server daemon is command line configurable so you&#x27;re better off saving your RAM and managing your server via SSH (or better yet, Vagrant / Puppet / equivalent)<p>In my experience, Linux is actually very good on servers.

Strings of different length had different types and you could not pass a string of length 30 to a procedure that expected a string of length 31. The way to solve this is to declare that all your strings had the same length and hope that it would be enough. It was horrible and at the time I found the C approach much more reasonable.

Programmers would test with byte-strings, everything is fine, customer is in east Europe, and you know what happens next. I think I decided that UTF-8 was actually worse than UTF-8-xor-69 so that the innermost code should be able to tell whether or note this was a bytestring or not. Explicit tagging found <i>loads</i> of bugs that day.<p>An array of bytes is a storage medium. If you don&#x27;t need the number of utf-8 characters (and given things like combining characters and invisible spaces, it&#x27;s rare that&#x27;s what I actually need) and just need to print and compare, byte-strings are efficient and acceptable. The text remains utf-8 encoded, but `length` is `O(1)` or a simple scan, and `substr` (or similar) are `O(1)`+the cost of allocating.<p>However if I need to recode things, an array of 32-bit (or 64-bit hah) ints is sometimes better. If the language has a real iterator, UTF-8 might still be okay, but then you are still using a bytestring anyway.<p>Lastly, if the &quot;string&quot; actually knows its character set, then using things besides UTF-8 might be good because it saves a lot of space. Maybe. I&#x27;m not really convinced because the tag for the character set (as you rightly think necessary) takes up space too.

Wouldn&#x27;t 20h/wk jobs be limited to inherently part-time, low importance tasks--which means you got to have plenty of funds to staff for them in the 1st place?<p>It would seem to me that 2 people working 20h/wk offers some significant advantages over one person working 40h/wk.<p>Firstly, it allows for fail-over; when one person is unable to work (due to holiday or illness, for example) the other might be able to handle 40h/wk for a short period to cover. If one person leaves the company suddenly, it allows for continuity of knowledge while a third person is hired and trained.<p>Secondly, it allows for variable output; two people can &quot;burst&quot; up to 80h/wk in response to workload, whereas one person would find that very stressful.<p>Thirdly, multiple people bring multiple points of view, increasing the chances of serendipitous ideas and solutions, and increasing the potential benefit of using people&#x27;s special skills or experience. Basically, the company is renting two brains for the price of one.<p>There are some downsides too: The management overhead is higher (equipment, legal, payroll, etc...) and things that were simple when done by a single person are now more complex since there needs to be coordination between multiple people.<p>To use an incredibly bad analogy: It&#x27;s like moving from a monolithic &quot;big iron&quot; server to a pair or farm of smaller ones. There are many advantages, but it means it&#x27;s now a distributed system with all the problems that can bring.<p>The problems aren&#x27;t insoluble and don&#x27;t limit 20h/wk employees to low-importance tasks: Many open source and volunteer projects function perfectly well with many, small, variable inputs from their contributors, many of which will be high-importance.",1451997075

10842876,comment,10834385,10835580,0,0,sridca,,,"> Emotions are, in fact, rational, inasmuch as they act in the person&#x27;s best interest.<p>Nope. Quite the contrary in fact. Emotions are, in fact, emotional, inasmuch as they act in best interest of one&#x27;s genes. Such as raping multiple women and getting away with it. Or killing another&#x27;s tribe&#x27;s men and women and children to acquire their resources. In modern times the same game is often played out although not to the same extent.<p>> Take, for instance, fear. If you are face to face with something dangerous, you feel fear, which drives you to get away from the feared object--a rational response to danger.<p>First of all, fear is not a result of facing with &quot;something dangerous&quot; (which danger was appraised at the cognitive level) as the emotion of fear is instantly -- with no conscious forethought, much less &quot;rational response&quot; -- triggered in response to sensory cues that are indicative of danger in an evolutionary sense. A fast moving snake for instance. In modern times however the &#x27;cues&#x27; for fear often have underpinnings on one&#x27;s socialized identity (such as fear of getting rejected by whomever).<p>> Anger works on a similar principle;<p>As explained above (and below), no emotion works on a rational principle.<p>> when you are slighted or hurt, you feel anger, which drives you to attack the thing that hurt you. Again, rational response, assuming no external factors (i.e., the person who hurt you is your boss and hitting them back doesn&#x27;t end well).<p>The emotion of anger itself -- which viscerally drives you to kill, maim or wound a fellow human being come what may -- is an emotional response sourced in the survival of the individual/species. It is not a rational response &quot;in the person&#x27;s best interest&quot;. Indeed, your tactically placed nebulous qualifier &quot;assuming no external factors&quot; tacitly implies that such an (instant) emotional response needs a (slow) cognitive rational appraisal to &quot;control&quot; it, lest one end&#x27;s up killing, maiming or wounding the other person leading to grave consequences (such as getting hurt back, or being sent to jail or losing what one holds dear).<p>> All emotions behave like this.<p>As explained above (and below), no emotion is (much less &quot;behave like&quot;) a rational response.<p>> They take certain inputs and return certain outputs.<p>The inputs are sensory cues (and also thoughts/beliefs themselves), and the outputs are war, rape, murder, domestic violence, etc. as demonstrated by human history.<p>> They are inherently logical, and assuming that the inputs are known and complete (you&#x27;re not missing any details, in other words) they result in rational decisions.<p>As the original comment is about &quot;source of&quot; emotions like fear, you are going on a tangent here talking about &quot;result[ing] in&quot; rational decisions.<p>> The reason we think of emotion as irrational is because Spock said it, and Spock only said it because he correlates emotion with the Romulans and their insanity.<p>Not everyone in this world is familiar with American Television, and yet all throughout the world peoples consider emotions are irrational visceral response (hence the need to cognitively &quot;control&quot; it, albeit with feeble success)<p>> As a final note, &quot;Rational&quot; really just means picking the option most likely to achieve your goals. By this measure, joy and sadness are both rational, as one indicates to others that you enjoy something (hopefully leading them to do it more often) and sadness provokes the opposite reaction.<p>You are watering down the word rational. Going by your definition if say a sociopath has set his &quot;goal&quot; to rape as many women as he can, then picking the best option in every day life situations to achieve that goal would be considered &quot;rational&quot;. Just so there is no confusion, here is what the word means:<p>1 based on or in accordance with reason or logic: I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a perfectly rational explanation.\n• (of a person) able to think clearly, sensibly, and logically: Andrea&#x27;s upset—she&#x27;s not being very rational.\n• endowed with the capacity to reason: man is a rational being.<p>Also sadness is a silly reaction, and has no rational use towards any felicitous goals.<p>> Why do you think we&#x27;re hardwired to get upset when we hear crying? It helps the species as a whole to achieve their goals if we work together to avoid things we don&#x27;t like.<p>First of all as the &quot;woman with no fear&quot; has plentifully demonstrated, emotions are not &quot;hardwired&quot;. Secondly, not everyone gets upset when hearing crying in any situation. Lastly, as a sensible goal of the human species can be said to be live in peace and harmony, I fail to see how the aforementioned emotions can help achieve the said goal (to the contrary, they lead to war, rape, murder, sorrow, and the like).",1451996841

Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.<p>Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We’re self funded and doubling yearly. As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we’re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We&#x27;re currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).<p>We looking for four main strengths in you:<p>◦ skill: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.<p>◦ desire to learn: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.<p>◦ understanding: our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You’ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.<p>◦ clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again. Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.<p>In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, building API integrations, and databases (particularly SQL Server).<p>We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight. So, if you’ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you.

So, one of the questions would be: does 20h/wk + 20h/wk = 40h/wk skills+involvement, ie. is it linear? Wouldn&#x27;t 20h/wk jobs be limited to inherently part-time, low importance tasks--which means you got to have plenty of funds to staff for them in the 1st place?",1451995468

Most likely those countries with shorter work weeks are developed countries which have higher output per capita than less developed ones not because working 40 hours a weeks is more productive than working 80, but that utilising a higher level of technology gives superior output.<p>The article is comparing the UK (long working hours, terrible productivity) with Germany (short working hours, very much better productivity).<p>It&#x27;s unlikely that there&#x27;s much difference in the technology available. And they both surely know about all the modern methods of organising a workplace.<p>I mostly agree with point 2, but<p>> We&#x27;d spend it doing the things we enjoy (damaging our livers?)<p>Maybe the reason so many british people drink too much is because they&#x27;re working too much, and they&#x27;re (mis)using alcohol to wind down.",1451995422
