While not a framework, think about the Go language. Go is a very strict, almost paternal language that &#x27;enforces&#x27; best practices in the language itself by giving you only one way to do something. Angular, on the other hand, provides numerous ways to create a service. Because of this confusion, the Angular team provides best practices. It&#x27;s like saying, &#x27;we screwed up in designing this thing, so you have to read all the documentation to find out the subtle differences in all this bullshit.&#x27; It&#x27;s not the lack of best practices that concerns me, it&#x27;s the abundance of them that gets shipped with a bloated framework that wasn&#x27;t designed well.<p>>Every large release?I seriously doubt it.<p>Think of all the pain involved in removing all of the digest cycle code when switching from Angular 1.4 to Angular 2.0.<p>> No they don&#x27;t, maybe a small differences and what do you mean with &#x27;templating&#x27;?

Second of all, Eliezer says:<p>>This is a work of fiction.  In real life, continuing to attempt to have sex with someone after they say &#x27;no&#x27; and before they say &#x27;yes&#x27;, whether or not they offer forceful resistance and whether or not any visible injury occurs, is (in the USA) defined as rape and considered a federal felony.  I agree with and support that this is the correct place for society to draw the line.  Some people have worked out a safeword system in which they explicitly and verbally agree, with each other or on a signed form, that &#x27;no&#x27; doesn&#x27;t mean stop but e.g. &#x27;red&#x27; or &#x27;safeword&#x27; does mean stop.  I agree with and support this as carving out a safe exception whose existence does not endanger innocent bystanders.  If either of these statements come to you as a surprise then you should look stuff up.  Thank you and remember, your safeword should be at least 10 characters and contain a mixture of letters and numbers.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled reading.  Yours, the author.<p>The point that the protagonists legalized rape, is to demonstrate that the protagonists morals are just as far from us, as the baby eaters or super happies. That the story isn&#x27;t about two alien societies, but three.<p>Second of all, what &quot;these kind of people&quot; find intriguing is that our morals are for the most part due to our circumstances. That in the future, people may very well accept what we find today to be abhorrent, and find abhorrent what we accept.<p>That is the point of &quot;is rape bad?&quot;. Because it is simply an example of something that is obviously bad. Just like some time ago there were other things that were considered obviously bad, that today we accept (same sex relationships for example). And if we are aware that the future will look back and mock us for our obviously wrong morals, then maybe we will be faster to get on the ball with the next gay rights or what ever.<p>Are there moral beliefs you hold today, that you think the future might condemn you for? Or do you think in this time and place you&#x27;ve acquired a perfect set of morals?",1452037738

See TMSP from the tutorial from Tendermint.<p><a href=""http://tendermint.com/posts/tendermint-socket-protocol/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tendermint.com/posts/tendermint-socket-protocol/</a><p>Yes, we&#x27;re moving away from &quot;PoS&quot; from the time being, because our clients are more interested in posting collateral external to the blockchain.  That said, the original security properties still hold.  It&#x27;s the combination of three things that create security on a non-PoW blockchain, for Tendermint.<p>* Validators have posted collateral (either on chain or off chain) that is not immediately transferrable, so there is something at stake.<p>* The BFT consensus algorithm ensures that at least +1/3 of validators must deviate from the protocol to attack the network.<p>* If there is a fork, then we can find out who had caused the fork.  The validator-set is held accountable.<p>That hasn&#x27;t changed.  What has changed is our client base.  We don&#x27;t want to launch a cryptocurrency ourselves because as US/Canadian residents, that&#x27;s a legal gray area.  On the other hand, fin-tech clients and banks <i>are</i> interested in utilizing this technology for creating a distributed multi-write database.  Thus the change in direction.<p>That said, we&#x27;re very much interested in support the original PoS design.  Other designs as well.  For example, we&#x27;re building out an experimental governance app that allows for arbitrary proposals.  Perhaps we can use that to empower users or designated administrator groups to decide on updates to the validator set.<p><a href=""https://github.com/tendermint/governmint"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tendermint/governmint</a><p>There are many ways to update the validator-set, PoS just being one of them.  We will build out our platform to accommodate a wide variety of strategies for managing the validator set.  For all strategies, they will make use of our robust BFT consensus algo.<p>Finally, there are sound technical reasons why a BFT ledger should utilize a hash-chain of blocks (list of txs).  It is both a speed optimization (validators only need to sign block hashes, not each tx) as well as a security requirement.  To expound on the latter, note that the original PBFT implementation does not provide any guarantees when more than 1/3 are Byzantine (see <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.121.9617&rep=rep1&type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.121...</a>).  But the hash-chain ensures fork consistency.  So there you have it, a chain of blocks of transactions is fundamentally important for non-PoW ledgers.  That&#x27;s why we use the term &quot;blockchains&quot;.",1452037737

And yet not only did we never get delayed, we routinely were ahead of schedule.<p>As the article points out, the trick is to get it into your blood -at the start-. If it feels like fixing exceptions takes all your time it&#x27;s probably because you have let a lot of them creep in.<p>How many known exceptions do you introduce per sprint? It should be zero; nothing new that you&#x27;re writing should be creating an exception, that isn&#x27;t fixed in the sprint.<p>So what&#x27;s left? Exceptions that are uncovered outside of the sprint. That is, you had a feature written, tests for it written, QA test it, client demos show it off, and any exception you saw you fixed already. So outside of all of that, where can exceptions even occur? Well, after release, obviously. Weird race conditions, deviations off the critical path, users doing unexpected things, etc. But the frequency of those should be pretty low. Maybe one, two a sprint, max? Surely you can take the time to dig in and fix those without causing the sprint to slip.<p>Now, as the article also mentions, when you start getting a huge, complex codebase (either due to time, or team size), this gets harder. More complexity = more edge cases. That&#x27;s one of the reasons to reduce complexity wherever possible, to isolate functionality as much as possible. And this also assumes you have a development process that has you delivering every sprint, and having the stuff used. If you&#x27;re doing some waterfall &quot;we&#x27;ll code like crazy for the next year, then test, then deliver&quot;, yeah, you probably can&#x27;t do it.

A race to the bottom on price, exacerbating the problem of assistant churn. $100/hr leaves a lot of room at the bottom, but it&#x27;ll drop to the point where people in the US aren&#x27;t willing to do the job of magic assistant.<p>3. $0 is the cost of Siri, Google Now, and Alexa. They truly suck right now, for almost everything except taking the place of a keyboard, but will get better. There&#x27;s a limit to what &quot;virtual&quot; assistants can do for you; at some point you need a meat robot to go physically do stuff for you, if you want assistance beyond what technology can do.<p>Not to trash talk the idea or the company, at all. I haven&#x27;t tried it. I can&#x27;t think of anything it could do for me that I wouldn&#x27;t rather hire an actual assistant for. At $100, you can get several hours of real human time, in your local market. Someone you can meet, and develop a rapport with. I&#x27;m ordinarily not on the side of the fence that insists that the personal touch is important (I don&#x27;t like car dealers and want them to disappear, I don&#x27;t like sales people at any store and generally want them to disappear, etc. because in general, they know less than me about what I&#x27;m shopping for and just serve to annoy me and occasionally lie to me to try to manipulate my decision). But, in this case, there is real value in a real live human having access to your daily life or work so they can be most productive about helping you get shit done.",1452037372

This is actually exactly the sort of challenge that traditional assistants pose and that Magic+ is designed to fix.<p>Magic+ is actually not just one person, but it&#x27;s a software-driven service with a highly trained team of professional assistants that are held to a very high bar. They are managed, supervised, and trained by us so that you don&#x27;t have to worry about it.<p>And, on top of that, every task and request is managed from beginning to end using custom software that is designed specifically to monitor the execution strategy and enhance both the quality and the reliability of the output. It&#x27;s difficult for me to say more right now about how this works without disclosing IP that we cannot disclose at this time, but I hope to be able to say more about how this works in the future.<p>A good way to think about Magic+ is that it&#x27;s a natural-language command-line interface for complex tasks that require some human interaction.  A component of how we handle your email is more like a  ~/.procmailrc file that can pipe things to a highly-supervised human assistant than it is like having a random person somewhere in the US logged in to your Gmail. You tell us how you need things done, using natural language, and it gets done, assuming it&#x27;s possible.<p>Again, I recognize that this explanation is not as detailed as it could be, but I hope that it helps.

You do your consultancy business which I&#x27;m sure you enjoy enormously and as you&#x27;ve said, 9 to 5 is just a bad dream for you.<p>But to move the whole of humanity into that direction, the whole of humanity have to be willing to put themselves in our position and actually self-educate and take control of their lives. As you can probably imagine that&#x27;s not going to happen any time soon.<p>Mr Carmack over here is a great example of the humanity I would like to live in, but he is the polar opposite of the humanity we actually live in. Sadly most people do not have ambitious dreams of creating new things! They learn enough to get by and that&#x27;s it. I am of course talking majorities here, I realise exceptions exist but the very sad truth is that people like being comfortable and stationary with very small aspirations in a world that&#x27;s actually progressing without them. In London we have this funny problem with the Underground: Most of it can be automated, but because of the mass firing that would result, it&#x27;s not being done due to humanitary reasons. The same humans that are being protected from this mass-atomisation are at the same time demanding absurdly high wages (£50k+) to do tasks that can be conducted by a £3000-£10000 robot and if these demands are not met, strikes!<p>Same thing with McDonald&#x27;s in the US. Although somewhat more reasonable there as their wages were quite low, these people are replaceable with some very basic machines. In the UK there are McDonald&#x27;s with automated ordering and paying stations. I just tap on a large touch screen what I want and stick a payment method in. That £3000 device just replaced a £15000 employee and is a lot more efficient at their job.<p>It pains me to say this but going forward this is going to be a self-regulating problem. There will at some point be massive unemployment which may cause quite a financial crisis and then it will regulate itself over time. In the new world that will come out of this crisis there won&#x27;t be any room for non-intelectual people as most automated jobs will be gone. It&#x27;s funny to think about it this way, but all those young adults getting university degrees, they might need them sooner than they think. The 20-25 y.o. that don&#x27;t have higher education right now will probably suffer the most in 10 years time.<p>TL;DR: While what is happening seems very heartless and cruel, with all the automation, it actually seems like a necessary step to evolve as a sentient species.<p>Damn it, I text-walled again... sorry :(",1452036836

In particular, a common demand was to hold a very high bar for quality and seamlessness of experience.<p>Right now, some of these user-requested experiences are more expensive to deliver than the original Magic pricing model accounted for. Our plan is to offer Magic+ at this price now, because there is good demand for it at this price, and drop the price over time to reach a larger and larger market. $100 dollars an hour is a lot, but our most active users tell us that for this level of elite service, it&#x27;s a bargain.",1452036658

They have been able to arrange everything I&#x27;ve asked them to do. What I like about them is that I can make a request without having any idea how to go about getting it fulfilled, and Magic will figure out how - they&#x27;ll do the research and find a solution. They are familiar with service providers for all sorts of unusual tasks and will set them up for you: personal chefs, car servicing pickup, garbage pickup - for everything I&#x27;ve asked they&#x27;ve had an answer.<p>They are primarily limited however by their staff on the ground or lack thereof. Although they&#x27;ve been able to organize couriers in several cities to accomplish tasks, they have occasionally been unable to find couriers on the day of a request. Magic is a generalist service: they can do virtually anything, but not necessarily within the same hour you ask. They&#x27;re worse than specialist services like Postmates at tasks like basic food pickup and delivery (mostly due to lower availability of couriers). Magic is most useful when your need is unusual and a typical service won&#x27;t be able to get it done - or when you want a complex problem to be solved and don&#x27;t want to have to think about or manage the solution. At such a task, they excel, and they&#x27;ve always come through for me in the end.<p>The Magic staff are very friendly and personable, as well. Their customer service is a tier above any other company I&#x27;ve interacted with. They handle requests with unusually high intellectual and emotional intelligence, and care.

That it uses cryptographic hashing is an implementation detail to the same degree that pieces of paper are an implementation detail of Wells Fargo money orders. What matters is that one person can reliably pay another person. The fact that people speculate on Bitcoin and not on Wells Fargo money orders should not cloud our thinking.<p>The Bitcoin protocol strives for absolute consistency to mitigate risk. Other cryptographic hash based protocols that are described as &quot;blockchains&quot; may trade the overhead of absolute consistency for speed and lower computational overhead, e.g. Ripple [1] uses consensus between `n - c*n` nodes as the basis of trust along with transaction costs to mitigate the odds of Byzantine failure that would result in double spend; in exchange transactions execute more rapidly and with less computational overhead. Again, there&#x27;s nothing magical about the implementation details. What matters is reliable trusted transactions of value. Bitcoin transfers can happen on the order of minutes, Ripple transactions can happen on the order of seconds.<p>What technologies that are described as &quot;blockchains&quot; tend to provide is low transaction fees. The time and expense of moving value via blockchain from Berlin to Cartagena is low compared to wire transfer independent of the blockchain&#x27;s provenance...provided of course that the end units of the exchange are suitable to all parties.

10846900,comment,10826838,10827659,0,0,mike429,,,"Thanks Futurebot for your thoughful, spot on and readable commentary all over the place. I hadn&#x27;t read this comment in particular before writing mines and I&#x27;m really happy to read a lot of the same arguments I gathered in different places over the years.<p>Absolutely, more safety net produces more innovation. That&#x27;s also what I thought. Thanks for saying, finally someone else says it!<p>Some arguments for it:<p>- the middle class was important for progress in the west. That&#x27;s a well established idea.<p>- the map of low vs high inequality countries points more toward high inequality --> less innovation per capita, on average. In particular at least, it&#x27;s clear that some of the nordic countries can pull off the highest innovation rates per capita while being among the most socialist countries. So at worst, most of the socialist policies won&#x27;t hurt. Like free school, free health care, financial regulations and less tax on the poor than on the rich. At worst, they just won&#x27;t affect innovation, and at best they actively contribute to it.<p>- the law of accelerating returns states that, in rough terms, &quot;computation power&quot; is a function of &quot;world knowledge&quot; which in turn is also a function of &quot;computation power&quot;. This is why it&#x27;s an exponential trend. Well, until we reach a point where computers can innovate on their own, human brains are still going to matter in the equation for progress, still going to be a bottleneck for progress, still for a few decades in the future. Yes more powerful computers is mostly what&#x27;s driving the exponential tech trend right now, but so is the raw number of brains at work, scientists and engineers in particular. This means that we need more bright kids in college and university.<p>Neo conservatives usually argue that &quot;making way for investors&quot; is the priority for the economy and innovation -- that it&#x27;s currently the bottleneck for innovation and the economy. But it&#x27;s clear for me that it&#x27;s not the case. Investing might be the easiest part to solve among the &quot;ingredients&quot; that are often cited to generate progress: 1) inventors+computers 2) investors 3) middle class buyers.<p>For me it&#x27;s clear that socialism would generally help 1) and 3), as well as 2) (for example with incentives for high risk investors or investors in renewable energy for example) while neo conservatism <i>might</i> help 2) only and be detrimental to 1) and 3) (especially with the current price of a university education and health care, 1) and 2) are affected negatively in non-socialist countries).<p>Important to point out that the law of accelerating returns formulated by Kurzweil doesn&#x27;t really acknowledge 2) and 3), except maybe indirectly (if you count the political model, which is currently btw in the US &quot;capitalist with some socialist measures&quot;, and say investing practices, as indirectly contributing to the &quot;human knowledge&quot; variable, which of course it is to some extend). In other words, it&#x27;s probable the only thing that matters significantly for progress and the economy, is more scientists and engineers. 2) and 3) are just helpers and we wouldn&#x27;t be near a bottleneck on those.<p>Interesting to point out that Kurzweil notes no significant variation in the exponential tech trend, throughout peace or war times, growth and recession periods. So either the only variable that changed significantly is the computational power available, or more likely the number of human brains at work also increased in the last century.<p>An interesting question is, would we still get the same rate of progress with the same number of scientists and engineers and investors and buyers that we had 100 years ago? I think not, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I think more smart human brains at work, besides having better and better computers, has been the most important variable for progress in the last centuries. And I think it still is somewhat important today, until we get fully independent computer-generated scientific or tech innovation.<p>Any response to these ideas would be welcome. Great if you change my mind or correct me on some details. Thanks.",1452035544

However, if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 PUT/LIST/DELETE requests per second or more than 800 GET requests per second, we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate.
