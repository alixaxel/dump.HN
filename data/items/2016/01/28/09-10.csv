Brought both to Apple (in Amsterdam) and they said it had something to do with my software. Yeah. VIM. It&#x27;s super heavy. Very nasty experience. Battery life on the Pro was not there either but they couldn&#x27;t find anything so I had to suck it up.</i><p>Are you implying there was some hardware reason your Macbook Pro was slower than an older Macbook?<p>And contrary to all CPU/HD/Memory specs and benchmarks and reviews for the respective models?<p>I&#x27;d be surprise if it was not software related.<p>And while you might &quot;only&quot; use Vim, that doesn&#x27;t mean much. I&#x27;m pretty sure you also browse, check email and do other things, so you do use many apps, Vim is just what you use most frequently.<p>In any case, all it takes is a single rogue app to make a machine crawl -- some haxie you installed that provides some third party functionality but don&#x27;t consider an app you use because you don&#x27;t interact with it, or even Spotlight with a corrupted index.<p>><i>A friend told me the Macbook pro is excellent. So I gave the Air away to a friend and bought a kitted out Pro. The misery. No battery life and it was slow with max mem and cpu. Slower than the Air on everything. Again; Apple says it isn&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t mention Vim again.</i><p>It&#x27;s not just Apple saying those machines are faster.<p>I can&#x27;t understand how a developer (since you use Vim) can make such statements. It&#x27;s not very difficult to compare the specs of the baseline configurations of the two models.<p>I&#x27;ve done heavy graphics, 3D, 4K video editing and DAW work on Macbook Pros and Airs -- while recent Airs are decent, there&#x27;s simply no comparison.

For someone, it can be that you can buy a BMW. However, if you want to buy a BMW you&#x27;re never just buying a BMW: you&#x27;re buying something else that actually satisfies you. The BMW is just a symbolic token for what you really want. If you know what that is then you also know whether buying that BMW is the right choice. It might be the perfect symbol for freedom or whatever in your life. Then go buy it. But you might be longing for something else and buying the car wouldn&#x27;t eventually make you happier. Then you would be looking for something else again but as long as you don&#x27;t know what you really want, you&#x27;ll be shooting in the dark.<p>For me, wealth is independence. The more independent I am the wealthier I am. In corollary, people with FU money are the richest people on the Earth on that scale. Myself, I&#x27;d happily live cheaply if that meant I could basically choose what to do instead of having to work to keep up with my spending. Once in a while I count how much would I need to own to produce capital income that would give me a basic standard of living and the money for some hobbies I&#x27;m interested in without constantly having to think much about money.<p>Maybe status is worth something for someone. Maybe if you show status (buy that BMW) and hang around with people wealthier than you, some of it actually sticks and you gain even higher income and status because of your connections, eventually. Or maybe, by looking for other people&#x27;s acceptance by the token of status, you&#x27;re just trying to find a way to convince yourself that you&#x27;re perfectly okay yourself and accepted just as you are. Then it might be less painful to deal with that first instead of hunting status for half of your life.",1453974026

If someone doesn&#x27;t realize that the index funds will go up and down based on the very market they&#x27;re indexing, and that all markets go up and down all the time, maybe that someone should just consume their money so that people with more wits can take better care of them.<p>Who would be such an idiot to claim they&#x27;re &quot;safe&quot; in the first place? Any investing is never &quot;safe&quot;: you can always risk losing part of your money, even if you invest in a house. Not investing your money isn&#x27;t safe either.<p>Indexes can certainly dip for years: that&#x27;s why you manage your risk and only invest money you don&#x27;t need <i>that much</i> so that you don&#x27;t have to cash in your investment during bad times. As long as the economy grows the growth will eventually be reflected in the indexes. Even a single 10-year period with a common stock index lower in the end rather than in the beginning would be, in practice, a rare occasion. Most depressions are over in a few years. Some continents can tank longer but you will want to buy indexes from different areas of the world anyway. Or you can only buy your local indexes, making sure you will yourself go up and down with the indexes you buy.<p>An index will grow a few percent annually in the average, compounded. This is over decades which imply bad years and very good years. To buy the most passive index funds that have the smallest operating costs and letting your money sit in there is <i>more and more likely</i> to beat active funds and individual stock picking simply by waiting for the years to go by.

These companies did so many years, even spanning decades. Their failures had more individual flavors and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s generalizable to &quot;they had lots of products&quot;. In fact, companies like Microsoft is still able to survive precisely because they had built up long tail and failure in one or two products didn&#x27;t entirely collapsed the company.<p>Apple&#x27;s core business requirement is high margins.

And the warranty. US/EU companies should be so ashamed. For not paying more they would get the laptop from my home and give me a new one mostly, no questions asked. Dropped, water damage, whatever. They still do that for company laptops but they are not so interesting anymore. They were then (8 years ago?) for me, especially the P1510/20 series. Panasonic took that over but they are a lot more expensive. My last P1510 works fine still. Brilliant stuff. Anyway.<p>After that;<p>My first 2 Macbooks were magic. I dropped an entire pot of tea on my 2nd one; it was before the moist sensors and it was under warranty so they replaced it. Very nice. While it was in &#x27;repair&#x27; I needed to work;  I bought a Macbook Pro and it was horrible. I got the old Macbook back and the Pro which should be faster was slower. Brought both to Apple (in Amsterdam) and they said it had something to do with my software. Yeah. VIM. It&#x27;s super heavy. Very nasty experience. Battery life on the Pro was not there either but they couldn&#x27;t find anything so I had to suck it up.<p>I bought an Air 11 inch. What a GREAT machine. Excellent battery life (I USE VIM 90% OF THE DAY FFS), light, looks good.<p>A friend told me the Macbook pro is excellent. So I gave the Air away to a friend and bought a kitted out Pro. The misery. No battery life and it was slow with max mem and cpu. Slower than the Air on everything. Again; Apple says it isn&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t mention Vim again.<p>Having said all that; smartphones. I want to use Android. I want to believe in Android and Android phones.  I have tried all top phones for Android. But no, it doesn&#x27;t work; iPhone really feels so much better. And tablets there is no comparison; iPad wins hands down. The MS stuff starts to get somewhere but i&#x27;m not using tablets for productivity as it still feels annoying and without productivity iPad really feels so nice. Maybe it happens (I&#x27;m trying) one day.<p>When I leave home on long trips I bring an iPhone, iPad and Lenovo X220 (18 hours battery). There is currently nothing that works better for me.<p>Edit: X220 is with Ubuntu; I cannot get into Windows for the past 33 years; I went from Basic -> CP/M -> MS DOS (very shortly) -> Unix (forgot the flavor) -> SunOS/Solaris -> Linux; Windows feels distinctly alien. It is not hatred or anything else than that I really cannot into it or see how I could work efficiently with it.",1453972405
