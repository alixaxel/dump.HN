It will only lead to a sad tail of how you created this huge bug that deleted all the customers data because you though this Boolean wasn&#x27;t used anymore, so you removed it.

Instead they got caught with their pants down at the Vive announcement.<p>And PSVR is going to be competitive with the Oculus recommended spec machines, which are 3-4X as expensive, due to smart choices in panel (less nominal resolution but more sub pixels saving 25% of performance for comparable quality; 60fps reprojected to 120Hz, saving another 33%). Both choices combined give it nearly a doubled performance boost relative to the hardware it is running on, allowing a similar quality of experiences for potentially close to a third of the total cost.<p>And Oculus won&#x27;t even have motion controllers until potentially the end of next year.",1453867104

D.C. proper doesn&#x27;t even have 1/10th the population of NYC; it&#x27;s smaller than even El Paso, TX and Charlotte, NC. It doesn&#x27;t even break the top 20 largest cities in the country.<p>Though more importantly, D.C. is unique politically because it&#x27;s not awarded the rights of a state, and therefore not protected from the federal government the way literally every other city in the US is. (Even San Juan, Puerto Rico, has more autonomy from the federal government in some ways than D.C. does)",1453867092

10978076,comment,10976737,10977704,0,0,ww520,,,"UDP is certainly faster than TCP, no question about it, because of different levels of quality of service.  However, coding for both is similarly simple, given the same requirement for short receive-only message.  TCP session has nothing to do with the complexity.  The complexity comes in how to do process() in parallel.<p>A receive-only message can be handled in TCP:<p><pre><code>   server_socket = create_and_listen_on_socket(..., MAXCONN)\n   while True:\n      csock = server_sock.accept()\n      msg = csock.recv()\n      csock.close()\n      process(msg)\n</code></pre>\nA UDP loop has similar steps, minus the accept and close.  The complexity to use threads or async to run process() is the same for UDP and TCP.<p>For a normal data volume remote command protocol, the simple TCP loop is more than adequate.  Just set a reasonable MAXCONN to queue up client connection requests, which can drop connections if there are too many requests, just like UDP dropping packets.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t believe lock can be avoided in Sonic Pi server when handling concurrent incoming commands, whether it&#x27;s written in Erlang or not.  Sonic Pi I believe has a single audio device, which makes it a shared resource.  Concurrent access to a shared resource has to be managed with lock somewhere along the call path.  In that case a single thread TCP server is perfectly fine, serving as a lock as well.",1453866539

10978070,comment,10976737,10977669,0,0,wallacoloo,,,"Although the article may not have made it clear, OSC is designed primarily to pass around <i>control signals</i>, rather than arbitrary, <i>non-contextualized</i> data. Control signals have inherent meaning, like &quot;fast-forward <n> seconds&quot;, &quot;set color to <x>&quot;, etc. The important distinction is that &quot;set color to <x>&quot; (a command) is distinct from &quot;{ &#x27;color&#x27;: &#x27;x&#x27;}&quot; (non-contextualized data).<p>The layout of <i>controls</i> is hierarchical in the protocol; each control has an associated endpoint, which looks very much like a unix file path. For example, to unpause an audio player, you would send the message &quot;/player/is_playing/set t&quot; (or f, to pause). If you wanted to control the bands of a 10-band equalizer, you could implement that as &quot;/player/eq/band/4/amp/set 0.5&quot; (there are certainly other ways to approach it too).<p>If you want to send control signals to multiple parts of the audio player at the same time, you could use a &quot;bundle&quot; composed of a separate message for each parameter you&#x27;re altering. All the messages will then be handled simultaneously.<p>Because of this, data does not need to be hierarchical. If you <i>really</i> want to, you can consider the endpoints to be &quot;keys&quot; and the control data to be &quot;values&quot; in a hierachical key -> value map, just to prove that everything you could do with hierarchical data is still possible using OSC. But I would encourage you to not think of it in that abstraction because the fact that OSC is built to pass messages, and not non-contextualized data is a large part of what differentiates it from other protocols like json streaming.",1453866434

Message passing has to do with communicating state transitions between multiple logical components, possibly running at the same time (regardless of whether they are in a monolith or not).<p>If you want to compare something with message-passing architectures a better comparison would be to a shared register.  Both are abstractions around communicating a shared piece of state.  The argument that debugging a message passing abstraction is easier hinges on the idea that the message passing coordination system decouples the sender and receivers state transitions from each other, where as in a shared register the state can be viewed as the state of both.  In systems where there are more than a couple pieces of shared state it becomes untenable to put every component that <i>can</i> share state into the precise stateful configuration that you need to debug an particular case.<p>It turns out in practice, that generally it is easier to break up monolithic applications that are message based than it is to break up ones that are using shared registers, but that is a side benefit of the abstraction not the real difference between the 2.<p>I&#x27;m a huge advocate of log based architectures, which take message passing architectures to another level.  That is, message passing architectures are good at limiting the things that <i>can</i> happen, log based architectures do that and add the benefit of capturing what <i>did</i> happen.",1453865425
