By comparison, the minimum power to operate at 1Mbps is about -98dBm.<p>Then again, receiving at 60mw (+17dBm) would overdrive any of the WiFi devices I ever tested and path loss of just 3dB (assuming +20dBm transmit power) is not achievable over the air, even with a near-field antenna. Keep in mind many devices actively tamper with the RSSI value reported up through NDIS, so while it&#x27;s possible for a card to report it is receiving at +17dBm, unless you have hard-wired the hirose connectors between AP and STA it&#x27;s not actually the case.

I&#x27;m fully on board with the consolidation of an array of core tools and services by a competent team.<p>I&#x27;m just not sure that I believe the systemd team is said team. Their behavior on mailing lists and bugzillas has been extremely disconcerting at times, such as when they screwed over kernel developers who used the debug kernel option and basically said &#x27;Tough shit that we broke the existing standard workflow, we don&#x27;t care&#x27; ( <a href=""https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76935"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=76935</a> )<p>Whether or not you agree that reasons like that are enough to distrust the team, if I were to keep running Linux in production, and make my own personal choice about what I am using, I can no longer realistically do this. Extremely necessary things such as udev being merged into systemd (and being a large pain in the ass to compile and use without systemd) mean this is no longer something as easy as replacing one or two components.<p>I&#x27;m all for convergence. Hell, I don&#x27;t even particularly like sysv init - if systemd was a product as refined as even SMF, I&#x27;d care a lot less.

SmartOS and OmniOS already have things very similar to systemd because of their Solaris heritage, and they work well. The BSDs seem to be moving in that direction, and I expect they&#x27;ll create a solid product. I&#x27;ll use those and be happy to do so. When I have to deal with other environments where Linux is used, well, I&#x27;ve learned plenty about systemd and feel perfectly comfortable working with it.

Ours was made more complex because it has to mesh with a 3D canvas, so originally it was a combination of overlapping DOM elements, an SVG element, and a 3D canvas. We also use React, so movement of the selection box created events that generally had to flow through multiple react elements. Getting the coordinates of everything matching in all three contexts was an exercise in annoyance (given how simple it seems), especially for things like fonts which have bounding boxes which bear only a passing relationship with the actual bounding boxes of the text on screen.<p>Eventually, we ditched the SVG and moved more things into 3D, which made for a better design in the end.
