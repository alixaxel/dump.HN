Defining ethics is extremely difficult, but volunteering our intuitions via examples helps us get closer and closer to narrowing what it is exactly that we&#x27;re talking about.<p>It&#x27;s mighty hard to pin down a universal definition for &quot;art&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, and even &quot;game&quot;- and yet we use these words regularly and mostly very successfully to communicate.<p>Discussing &quot;ethics&quot; is difficult too, but I am unconvinced by arguments of the &quot;it&#x27;s obviously all subjective&quot; variety.",1453478394

Combine that with a generation of folks whose knowledge of C dates back to a college course or four, in which efficient POSIX usage may not have been a concern, and one finds good, easy-to-read examples of POSIX harder to find than they really should be.",1453478386

I worked in C# for a few years improving some web services for a Finance company. This was long before Java 7 even, so as a language C# 4.0 seemed amazing to me at the time. Lambdas, LINQ etc, - I was blown away. Microsoft ecosystem, however was not really  wowing me in any way. There wasn&#x27;t for example any sort of equivalent to JMS in Microsoft land - MSMQ was simply pathetic in terms of functionality. Apache Active MQ for .NET wasn&#x27;t really mature at that point.

The seller generally pays ~6%, but sometimes that&#x27;s negotiated down.  This commission is split between the buyer&#x27;s agent and the seller&#x27;s agent, with their brokerage typically taking a percentage.  But a buyer wants to use an agent because their perception is that they&#x27;re not paying for it, and most buyers aren&#x27;t well versed with the house transaction process, which is complex.<p>You could certainly make the case that a transaction without agents would mean either more profit for the seller, or a lower house price for the buyer, but I think it will take many years until that is the norm.  There are a huge number of laws built around real estate transactions, and the NAR is a major major lobbying entity.",1453478272

10953407,comment,10943658,10952443,0,0,cptskippy,,,"> the art of dogfighting was deemed to have been lost for a brief period between WWII and the air war over Vietnam, and had to be re-engineered.<p>The air war in Vietnam was radically different from WWII so I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a fair comparison.  The art wasn&#x27;t lost, the state had just changed so radically that it was no longer applicable and new strategies had to be devised.<p>In WWII the dogfighting was typically between interceptor aircraft engaging bomber escorts at high altitude.  You won the day by either out maneuvering or out gunning your opponent.  At the end of WWII, arguably the best dogfighter in service was the P-51D Mustang which was incredibly fast at the time with a top airspeed of ~430 mph and was equipped with 6x 50 caliber machine guns.  It was designed as a high altitude bomber escort and was one of the fastest and most maneuverable aircraft of the time with a high offensive yield.<p>In Vietnam with the introduction of long range air-to-air missiles and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), close air-to-air combat was thought to be a thing of the past by the US.  Tactics had shifted from bombers escorted by fighters to extremely high altitude bombers which hoped to avoid missiles by sheer range, and close ground support aircraft like the A-1 Skyraider and A-6e Intruder which utilized low altitudes, slow air speeds, and high maneuverability to avoid being engaged by SAMs.  Fighter aircraft like the F-4 would provide theater support and engage enemies at range using air-to-air missiles.  These tactics were designed around engaging the Soviet Union or other Super Powers, the Vietnamese however were utilizing Mig-17s, which still prescribed to the WWII method of air engagement, and was a natural evolution of the WWII fighter being fast, maneuverable, and heavily armed for air-to-air combat.  What you ended up with were a bunch of aircraft ill suited for engaging one another.<p>The A-1 and A-6 could fly incredibly low and slow in comparison to the Mig-17 and with much greater maneuverability at low speeds making it difficult for the Mig-17 to engage them with missles.  The Mig-17 would have to perform slicing runs with machine guns which made it vulnerable to those aircraft coming and going.  The Mig-17 could easily outpace them however making it difficult for either US aircraft to act offensively.<p>The F-4 could offensively engage the Mig-17 at range and could easily out run it if necessary but the F-4 was far less maneuverable and lacked on-board machine guns making it ill suited for a close range dogfight.  The gun pod on an F-4 was initially hampered by the fact that it couldn&#x27;t operate at low speeds because it was air turbine driven and also lacked lead sighting so the gun was inaccurate at high speeds.  F-4 pilots used a spray-and-pray approach if engaging a target in close air combat.  The F-4 though was not an easy target for the Mig-17 because it was equipped with electronic counter measures and raw engine power that dwarfed the Mig.<p>In the end completely new tactics had to be devised and lots of lessons were learned from the mistakes in Vietnam but there really wasn&#x27;t a losing and rediscovering of an art.",1453478158

The playerbase often feels cheated when their existing collection&#x27;s value decreases and new content is pushed. You find the same feelings with MMO expansions. &quot;My top tier raid gear just got replaced 10 minutes into this new content? Then why did I spend all this time.&quot; While this sentiment may be illogical, game design often touches on player psychology.<p>Also it allows casual players who may take a several month break to return. The top tier decks may change, but a deck that was good a year ago would still be relevant for casual play.<p>The comparison isn&#x27;t exactly fair since MTG cards have a dollar value, but HS cards only have a perceived time-sink value. Also the out right refusal to rebalance existing cards does make the game stagnant. But that feeds back to the casual play argument. If cards were completely rebalanced it would be prohibitive to returning players. I would be interested to see numbers on casual v hardcore players. Reddit has a skewed perspective, and it seems like everyone has a full set.

Apple, in comparison, has stuck to two relatively low-clocked cores to deliver balanced performance.<p>When my iPhone got stolen, I briefly had a Droid Maxx 2 (Verizon&#x27;s version of the Moto X Play), which was the laggiest phone I&#x27;ve ever owned (and that includes a $130 Lumia 620). Its Snapdragon 615 has a GPU so anemic it can&#x27;t handle even basic Google Play Store animations without stuttering. But it&#x27;s got eight cores, which apparently checks the boxes of Android ODMs because the 615 is used in nearly every upper mid-range Android phone. That&#x27;s what happens when spec-heavy marketing drives your system architecture.<p>And the focus on specs (cores, clockspeed), ironically results in worse performance.

It&#x27;s no problem to put one on a phone.<p>I would:<p>- Comply. Rip encryption out of the OS. [keep reading!]<p>- Make a plug-in for the crypto. That probably already exists in the form of a library, but in any event it doesn&#x27;t seem hard.<p>- Have a system update -- one that is fetched very, very early in system setup -- download and install that plugin. To avoid the possibility that downloads can be blocked, you release the source code and give existing phones, already in many hands, the ability to compile that code on the device (some handwaving here, but you can probably make that secure, for specifically that plugin, and maybe exactly that version of the source). You need a way to distribute bug fixes, but again you&#x27;re dealing with source that&#x27;s not part of the OS.<p>That source-level plugin isn&#x27;t an operating system, and we&#x27;re back in territory where the government has to ban specific software components, and maybe ban source code (which is going to be a really difficult 1st Amendment argument).",1453475147
