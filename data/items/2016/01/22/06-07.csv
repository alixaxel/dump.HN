The concept of &quot;Unlimited Wants&quot; and Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s &quot;Pecuniary Canons of Taste&quot; pretty much wrap up a capital glut.  Spend it.  Money flows somewhere.  A demand shortage is not necessarily permanent (horse carriages vs automobiles withstanding)...that&#x27;s one of the many reasons why the word pivot exists in YC vernacular.  Everyone/everything living consumes.  There are demands that are fundamental, and demands that are extraordinary.  A market exists for all demands, no matter how small or how large.  Demands = needs small or great.  If you are selling buggy whips in the automobile age, yeah, you might have a demand shortage...so think and pivot.

Here are some distinction to keep in mind.<p>1) From the moment I stepped onto MIT&#x27;s campus I was actively recruited by Silicon Valley companies. My freshman year was tough getting much attention, but recruiters would talk to me and generally gave off the vibe that I was wanted. Contrast this with going to a HBCU where these companies are not present on campus, or if they do show up its only for a day or two for a career fair. You wouldn&#x27;t feel as welcome coming there.<p>2) I had black friends who were upperclassman who had &quot;made it&quot; in SV. They could offer advice and guidance. When I moved out to SV I also had them as part of social circle so I had social ties outside of work. Coming from a HBCU its likely you do not know anyone who works at these companies. You also do not know anyone who lives in the area to socialize this. If you do not relate to the people from work then you have trouble making friends.",1453445523

(One reason might be that there&#x27;s a greater incentive to cut corners on worker treatment when you&#x27;re for profit rather then just doing it out of the goodness of your heart, but that would justify at most <i>tighter oversight</i>, not moral condemnation of doing the thing at all, as we normally see.)",1453445491

The block of land is taxed, the bank account is taxed, the bond is taxed, the factory is taxed, the truck is taxed, the cow is taxed, the patent is taxed, the copyright on a movie is taxed, etc, etc.<p>If you did this you would not need a very high tax rate (my guess is something around 1%) and it would encourage efficient allocation of assets. Of course the owners of all these assets won’t be happy and since they are very powerful this idea has zero chance of ever being adopted.",1453445454

For your concerns, the news is much better than anything from research on solar cells, energy storage, wind farms, geothermal energy, nuke energy, carbon-taxes, etc.<p>The news is really, really simple and says how to address your concerns in the best way, absolutely, positively the best way possible.<p>In three posts in this thread, I&#x27;ve given a reference to a quite well done BBC video available at YouTube.<p>The secret solution, best possible for your concerns?  Sure: Do nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Do zip, zilch, and zero.  Totally f&#x27;get about it.<p>Why? Because as in the video, CO2 has nothing at all to do with the climate -- in any meaningful sense at all.  None.  All details are in the video.  It&#x27;s like you had some doctors tell you you had a very sick child and then a week later told you that it was all a mistake, that some lab tests got mixed up, and, in fact, your child is fully healthy.<p>And from CO2, the earth is fully healthy.<p>Again, why?  Because in fact, CO2 has no effect at all meaningful.  It didn&#x27;t in the past several hundred thousand years, isn&#x27;t now, and won&#x27;t for the foreseeable future.<p>Best news you can get.  Why? Because to save the planet from the dangers of CO2, you don&#x27;t need to work on solar, wind, nukes, carbon-taxes, home insulation, subsidies, EPA shutdowns of coal plants, have cold houses in the winter and hot houses in the summer, etc.  All those things you were doing to save the earth from CO2, you get to stop all of them.<p>Now, is this a happy day for you?<p>I&#x27;m not joking.<p>Watch the movie.

10951193,comment,10941671,10946091,0,0,bobwaycott,,,"Who, and by what metric, determines what &quot;unhealthy food&quot; is? We&#x27;ve all seen plenty of disagreement within nutrition science. Many people take positions that are somewhat more philosophical than scientific. Some foods may only be unhealthy in specific quantities, or in combination with other foods in specific quantities.<p>Furthermore, there are medical conditions--and even treatments for medical conditions--that can cause obesity that have nothing to do with a person&#x27;s diet. Should the people suffering from these situations be charged more for their health insurance?<p>Here&#x27;s a real-world example:<p>A friend of mine&#x27;s wife was, at the time they discovered she was pregnant, diagnosed with leukemia. It has been the most awful thing I&#x27;ve witnessed in some time. A mid-five-foot woman, who probably barely weighed 120 pounds, after months of different treatments, wound up with a host of medical complications, then further treatments. This all wound up causing her to gain what looked like probably 100+ pounds. Last year, they paid over $18K in out-of-pocket medical expenses.<p>It seems unconscionable to me to advocate my friend and his wife should have to pay more for health insurance because she&#x27;s now <i>technically</i> obese. They can already barely survive (she cannot work, and he spent 5 months unemployed last year).<p>Bottom line: very few things are simply black-and-white. There are so many shades of gray. The real world is full of myriad complications and counterexamples that ought to help us realize we can&#x27;t just draw simplistic lines in the sand based on silly, poorly conceived premises. Oh sure, it sounds good when the idea pops in your head, especially when it doesn&#x27;t affect you--always because your conception doesn&#x27;t ever include you. But it&#x27;s bound, like all things, to come down with undeserved and unbalanced harshness on <i>somebody</i>.

10951188,comment,10923885,10934949,0,0,malandrew,,,"I guess I misunderstood what the parent comment was about. Now that I&#x27;ve reread it, it&#x27;s subtle, but I can see what it&#x27;s driving at.<p>That said, now that I understand it, I feel like the parent comment being sexist toward both men and women to illustrate a false dichotomy.<p>It stereotypes women as being interested &quot;wine tours, maybe some yoga, [and] trashy soap operas&quot;. I&#x27;ve met plenty of women in tech that have no interest in such things and I&#x27;ve met plenty of male engineers in tech interested in the first two of those three things. I don&#x27;t know anyone in tech interested in the last item and to be honest I can&#x27;t imagine a dominantly female tech industry establishing a culture where anyone is interested in such things. Looking at all the female engineers I work with that are great coders and great to work with and solve problems with, I can&#x27;t imagine them really creating a culture that values social activities different from the ones I see my male colleagues participating in. They&#x27;d still play board games. They&#x27;d still read and watch sci-fi. They&#x27;d still hike and cycle. None of these activities strike me as particularly male oriented. They strike me as nerd oriented and they are incompatible with societies neurotypical social expectations for both men and women.<p>===<p>Strangely this particularly part of the comment caught my attention:<p><pre><code>    &quot;And you have to be _so careful_ to be friendly, but not \n    _so_ friendly that your co-workers think you&#x27;re hitting on\n    them.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhat I found interesting is that it called my attention to something I had never noticed before and haven&#x27;t seen anyone else point out.<p>When I look around at my workplace and previous workplaces, there are women who have a lot of ease fitting in and there are women who don&#x27;t. Those that do remarkably well are often remarkably similar to the men who do well. They care about code in and out of work. Their interests outside of work are nerdy (hacking, making, sci-fi, board games, etc.). They spend relatively little time preening (social self-grooming).<p>Those that are most challenged and have the biggest difficulty fitting in and getting along with their colleagues don&#x27;t share these traits. One trait I see in common with many of the women that have difficulty in tech culture is that the more closely approximate the gender roles and expectations that society at large sets for them; the most damaging of which is preening. Society has for a long time had a strong expectation for women to self-groom socially a lot more than men. Women are basically expected to wake up each morning and dress well, put on make up, etc. Those that don&#x27;t do this will encounter friction socially outside the office and those that do will encounter friction inside the office.<p>The reason I find this observation interesting is that it&#x27;s not even a problem exclusive to women in tech. Men that socially self-groom are more likely to feel like outsiders. An example of such high social self-grooming that would make you feel like you don&#x27;t belong is wearing collared shirts, nice pants, nice shoes, possibly even a suit jacket or even a full suit. Interestingly, Greg Foster over at AirBnB even wrote about this exact type of discrimination in his essay &quot;Does tech discriminate against suits?&quot;[0].<p>Assuming this is valid anecdotal observation, there are two things to consider:<p>- For this particular phenomena, is this illustrative of tech discriminating against women or is it tech discriminating against the high self-grooming? (I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t other ways in which women are made to feel like outsiders, I&#x27;m just picking one in particular that applies to men as well, but AFAICT seems to affect women disproportionately, since I&#x27;ve observed that women are likely to continue to highly self-groom in an engineering environment.)<p>- If it is, then is the problem with tech discriminating against male or females that are high self groomers or does the problem lie with society at large that imposes far greater pressure on women to self-groom outside the workplace. Put another way, should hacker culture be accepting and welcoming of high social social self-grooming or is it mutually incompatible like low social self-grooming would be in an industry such as fashion and design?<p>Anyways, the reason this original comment is additionally interesting in light of this observation, is that high social self-grooming by women (or men) generally contributes to feelings of sexual attraction, such that those women that do feel and give into society&#x27;s pressure to self-groom likely have to worry far more about being friendly with their co-works than those that don&#x27;t.<p>Anecdotally, and speaking for myself here, the female colleagues I feel sexual attraction for and that I possibly would attempt to court (were they not professional colleagues of mine) are those that are higher social self-groomers. Those that are low social self-groomers feel far more like professional peers than potential partners.<p>At the end of the day, the evolutionary reason for social self grooming comes down to status and mating. Men, especially men in Silicon Valley, don&#x27;t have the same pressure from society to dress in a way that appeals to courtship instincts (the average male techie outfit of ill-fitting hoodies, jeans, sneakers and t-shirt doesn&#x27;t get you that far in terms of attracting the attention of those attracted to your gender or gender identity).<p>I&#x27;m curious to hear other people&#x27;s thoughts here? Agree, disagree?<p>Lastly, please don&#x27;t interpret my attempt here to describe and predict as an attempt to prescribe. I&#x27;m thinking aloud in an attempt to be mindful and seek deeper understanding here.<p>[0] <a href=""https://medium.com/@gregorymfoster/does-tech-discriminate-against-suits-2b3462f43d78#.d6zt9digp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@gregorymfoster/does-tech-discriminate-ag...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_theory</a>",1453445096

AWS credentials (IAM of course) are either stored encrypted in LocalStorage (or Websql or indexeddb or who knows what we are supposed to be using) or queried on demand. It would interact with s3 directly (there is a browser based js api for aws) to manage and modify files directly (multi-user contention and eventual consistency be damned - for small sites it&#x27;s simply not an issue), and when appropriate, generate/regenerate the static files. Because everything is done client side, the webserver itself never sees or cares about your aws credentials.<p>Clearly, being a &quot;static site generator&quot;, only the admin interface would be JS based, the user-facing generated content would be static. [For some reason every post i&#x27;ve seen doing something remotely similar wants their mostly static content to be rendered at runtime in their js app???]<p>With prosemirror under active development you should soon be able to have a simple js based WYSIWYG rich text editor that generates nice clean Markdown to feed into your template of choice (à la Jekyll). Your end-users don&#x27;t need to know markdown or care, they just get a fairly basic rich text editor. Give them a simple interface for defining a website&#x27;s structure and bob&#x27;s your uncle.<p>Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m the only person who thinks this way.",1453444771

Power moved from js into css which I&#x27;m okay with (and browsers are too).<p>As for git.

If you get rid of the &quot;editing files requires a text editor&quot; part, then your site is easy and maintainable.<p>Git I think is a bit more programmer-focused of an api for random blogger joe, but a light wrapper might work. Maybe something like emailing a server with subject &quot;POST: title of blog post&quot; body &quot;text for post&quot; and having the server grab that data from the email, if it came from an allowed user, throwing it into the posts/ folder, git committing it and then deploying it to an apache server on itself. Actions like &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;edit&quot; would just search for files with the exact name as in the subject and do the required git action on it.<p>Something like this could probably work. Email clients already have the text editor users want, why rebuild the wheel?

If you argue about eating on the Internet, step back and understand that your experiences will always vary. Just own that it&#x27;s an opinion, and I won&#x27;t begrudge you an opinion. I&#x27;ll call it wrong, but I&#x27;ll let you have it. It&#x27;s your opinion.",1453442519

I&#x27;m actually anticipating (wishing?) that &quot;p2p web&quot; (decentralized LAN applications) is going to start taking off soon. I think it&#x27;s a matter of people building software that makes LANs easier to use for ordinary people.  BT Sync is an excellent example of something like this.  So is WebTorrent.<p>I had fantasies when Web Audio and Web Midi first were announced of browser based digital audio tools that people would use in one anothers physical presence, over a small local network.  There is no reason that every network application needs to depend on centralized services!  I was lucky enough to attend Music Hack Day in Berlin and created this Web Midi/WebRTC chat room as an example.

Don&#x27;t argue with me, argue with the parent.<p>What I&#x27;m arguing for is on how we should look at universal basic income. Some people see UBI as a way to increase aggregate demand. I see UBI as a way to get rid of poverty, so there would be no such thing as what you call &quot;the poor&quot;. The difference is that I don&#x27;t see a lack of aggregate demand as a problem. If we could rid our society of poverty without making a dent in aggregate demand, I see that as a win.<p>Another way to think about it is in terms of productivity. Do we really need to make everyone more productive? Do we need to be make the poor maximally productive before lifting them out of poverty? Why can&#x27;t we just lift them out of poverty?",1453442449
