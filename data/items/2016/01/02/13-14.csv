I don&#x27;t really think he&#x27;s making a strong argument not to ever use NSNotifications, though I&#x27;d agree they should ideally be bigger stuff related to application state changes.<p>Delegate is probably the most fool proof way to do it and is pretty much protected by the compiler to give you the warnings you might need and doesn&#x27;t require much template. But ultimately there are a lot of things where it&#x27;s frankly a one to many scenario and delegation is out of the picture.<p>I suppose I&#x27;ve continually grappled fixing both bugs in KVO and NSNotification, and it seems like Notifications are much easier to find by just searching for the const string to audit the observers. KVO is tricker especially if there are keypaths and what if the name of the property is changed? The whole thing happens in the runtime so it&#x27;s basically a nightmare.<p>So ultimately yeah, you can clean up KVO and make a better implementation. I&#x27;ve written something that makes a intermediary object that managed some of the trickier aspects of KVO (having to call super and pass a context and dealloc etc). But now I&#x27;m at a new place and I wouldn&#x27;t put the effort into getting everyone on board into using that code instead of the usual Foundation stuff.",1451743183

For example, we don&#x27;t understand how some brain function works. For some reason we might get a hypothesis that it is governed by a production of a certain neurotransmitter (very simplified here). At that time we have no other version of how the function might work at all. Then we do experiments where we mess with the said neurotransmitter, or a brain region, etc. If the results show that there is no measurable effect on the brain function, then that hypothesis becomes disproven (or at least a certain specific way of understanding that hypothesis).<p>If there is no alternative that might just mean that we haven&#x27;t found it yet. Or that the current framework we&#x27;re using is not suitable to the question. But even then working on existing hypothesis might give a lot of information on what framework might actually work.",1451742962

I think Node did well at the start in part due to being able to build everything new with non-blocking I/O in mind.

When I was young I was an overseer on a strawberry picking field (where you sit with your knees in the mud and have to try not to kill your back); I made minimum youth pay. I had that job because the farmer was a family friend. No Dutch people wanted to do the actual physical work, so it was only Turkish and Moroccan working at the actual picking. They got paid by the box, not by the hour; they made insane amounts of money from 5 am till noon. Enough to make me do that instead after a while. I could pay for vacations, going out, new stuff while my friends with jobs got minimum youth wage and couldn&#x27;t do that. AND they didn&#x27;t have off from noon; I had my whole day.<p>The same happened in another job at a supermarket where I packed products in the logistics center; the pay was minimum youth wage, but if you picked more than 600 articles/day, you got paid extra and working at night you got extra on top of that. I worked like crazy and made, again, a lot more than the regular adult local/white workers who worked super slow and usually didn&#x27;t make close to 600. The immigrants and me worked our asses off to make more; most Dutch guys (no girls; it was too heavy to carry most boxes) refused to.<p>If these jobs would be per hour, I don&#x27;t think anyone would want to do them well at all. We did them well because it made more money; if you get crap per hour, you wouldn&#x27;t want them but poor immigrants still do and they work hard to keep them.<p>There are shows on UK television where these angry (usually racist / Daily Mail readers) people get offered jobs they say &#x27;immigrants took their jooobbss&#x27; and they film them; it always ends with them getting fired as they find it too heavy (start holding their backs after 2 hours because they are out of shape) and find the breaks too short, don&#x27;t have discipline etc. Is that not the same in the US in many of these cases?

Performance is but one and over the decades it has become less of an issue, but hasn&#x27;t vanished which should be noted, you usually have to out do the technology you want to push out.  Have you ever modularized something too much?  It is a meme here, abstractfactoryfactorybuildersingleton.   You break things down in to simple singular purpose components that are easier to build correctly and reusable, then all the sudden you have your favorite Java or .net framework with abstract factory factories.<p>Take jboss, for example,  great code.  High quality code. It really works.  Complex as all fuck to start using.  Then when you want to understand something like jboss serialization, it&#x27;s spread among a dozen classes in a way you&#x27;d have never imagined when you started thinking about it, you just want some function to look at the implements their algorithm. It didn&#x27;t get that way by accident or even stupidity, it&#x27;s too reusable.  Or rather, their extreme modularity comes at a cost, maybe it&#x27;s worth it but I don&#x27;t see a lot of people bragging about a new jboss based whatever here...<p>Apply this to you operating system and ask yourself why.  Why does netbsd port so well to new hardware? And why do people do that?  Why is it more difficult to write a posix service on top on a microkernel than a monolithic one!  Surely, it&#x27;s a smaller chunk of code, it should have less complexity, be easier to write, right?  It&#x27;s not, just look at Hurd.  The cost is the price of the modularity, your posix service needs to rely on other services, those dependencies need to be coded for, faults handled, etc.  what does posix open do when the filesystem service is not responding? (Hint, it depends on the type of fault and whether or not it&#x27;s recoverable, or you think it is)<p>They should logically be easier to build and because of that we should be crapping them out left and right. Plan9 should be micro kernel.

For some people, hobbies are more important than jobs, and those hobbies might include traveling around the world, living in a different country, etc. Similarly, some people value family over work, so if their family relocates they would go along as well, giving up their job.<p>But even in just the realm of money and career, there are companies that offer benefits beyond money - like a certain freedom and culture - so you might feel &quot;properly compensated&quot; there.
