Of course we can skip that data manipulation and go direct to the result in this trivial example, but that doesn’t illustrate anything very useful about programming with the different syntactic styles more generally.",1451728757

We could slap SMT onto a wide range of elaborators (as it has been a stated goal for the Lean prover, and there has been attempts in Isabelle, Coq and Agda too if I recall correctly). Practical elaboration already involves a large amount of machinery that isn&#x27;t reflected in kernel type theory, so I don&#x27;t see why Nuprl would be better in this regard.",1451728658

That books and &#x27;letters&#x27; have a downside is reasonably well documented, cultures that do not rely on writing for passing their information down from generation to generation are richly populated with people that perform feats of memory casually that astound those that rely on the written word. That the advantage lies with the &#x27;books&#x27; faction seems to be a foregone conclusion (this is usually the case when you compare a human that is augmented with some tool against one that is not so that&#x27;s a bit of an open door to kick in) but it is always important that almost everything comes with some kind of price tag and if you can&#x27;t see the price tag you might make the wrong decision in some of these cases.<p>Just like calculators cause us to become (much) worse in mental arithmetic (but we can do <i>much</i> more complex math in a short time even without the required skills).",1451728236

10825640,comment,10824383,10825514,0,0,Renaud,,,"Microsoft has done many shady things in its many years of existence. It&#x27;s a big company with many tentacles and there have been plenty of dick moves, shoddy deals and intimidation.<p>However, qualifying every interest that MS has in tools or languages with the 3E scare is like crying wolf: people will simply stop listening to you and take you seriously. \nHistory should not be ignored but people and companies change, especially if they want to stay relevant.<p>Last I heard, Java was still pretty popular on every platform and the scandalous birth of .Net has been a boon to everyone interested in programming for Windows. So much so that almost every aspect of .Net is getting open sourced and its cross-platform story is really shaping up to something decent.<p>Browser wars were in the 90s... how far back do we have to hate?\nNetscape didn&#x27;t deserve to down that way, but don&#x27;t forget that the Netscape Navigator was not free. MS forced it free and made Netscape disappear in the process.\nGood thing or bad thing? We can speculate on what could-have been but no-one is paying for their browser today and yet there are at least 5 or 6 good ones to choose from. We can also argue browsers may still be closed source today if Netscape had been profitable and if Netscape (the company) still had its way with the various standards that underpin the web.\nMS was punished for their strong-arm tactics. Not punished in a particularly effective way, but it still cost them quite a bit and tarnished their reputation even further.<p>Javascript is a standard and as such all those people creating the standard represent their own interests. It happens on every single standard in the world and it&#x27;s certainly not limited to those of our industry.\nI don&#x27;t like it, it&#x27;s not always done in the interest of those implementing those standards, but I don&#x27;t think singling-out MS is entirely fair, especially considering that they do have the right to participate since they still provide some of the most used browsers (even if it&#x27;s by default).<p>TypeScript is good. It changes nothing to JavaScript, it&#x27;s open source and there are plenty of people who use it to great advantage. I really don&#x27;t understand what MS is supposed to do here? Nothing? \nTypeScript is so good the Angular guys at Google have switched to it. Why? Because you can build lots of interesting tooling around it and have a whole classes of issues statically checked, something plain old JS doesn&#x27;t really provide.<p>Lots of people have forked Node. The Node people have forked Node. It&#x27;s Open Source, that&#x27;s the nature of the game. It&#x27;s good, Node will improve and if what MS does is rubbish then no-one will use it because no-one is forced to.<p>There is no reason for MS to invest in these technologies to see them fail (the extinguish part of 3E). MS is heavily invested in them and need them to work well on their platform and services because programmers of today use Open Source by default and expect a good experience.\nThere has been a huge shift in mentality at MS over the years. Open Source won, we should be happy that the majority of the web is built on it, even MS is aware of that.<p>It&#x27;s not the nineties any more. Doesn&#x27;t say we shouldn&#x27;t be vigilant, but but not every decision out of MS is to be viewed with paranoid suspicions, there are lots of very great and very respectable folks who work there and take pride in what they do, we should give them a little credit.",1451726194

There are very few good reasons (read exceptionally bad conditions) for going slower than a truck&#x27;s max speed. 90% of the time, people are just not paying attention. From the truck drivers perspective, this is nearly coercion, especially where overtaking is forbidden. I once tried to overtake a car on a highway in southern Germany which went like 80 km/h. I drove a 60t mobile crane, limited to 89 km/h (like most of the trucks in Europe are). When she realised that, she accelerated and I had to stop the maneuver. Then she fell back to 80 km/h again. Rinse and repeat for two times. Guess what I did then. Hint: There was some serious honking involved, too.<p>Also please keep in mind there is a grey area between tailgating and starting a passing maneuver and at least in my country it is tolerated to reduce the safety distance in order to start overtaking.",1451726144
