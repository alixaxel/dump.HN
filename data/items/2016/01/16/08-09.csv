Progressive policies did not emerge in late-19th-century America, much less take hold, because there was a decrease in social inequality in general. This is the exact opposite of what the historical record shows us. Progressive policies emerged out of an increasingly wider recognition of social, political, and economic inequalities nationwide in the latter 19th century. This is what prompted farmers to band together with the labor movement to fight the railroads and banks, movements that were inherently critical of capitalism itself, and not just inequality of condition or remuneration. It wasn&#x27;t a decrease in social inequality that fueled the drive for expanding suffrage. I simply cannot understand how one can hand-wave progressive achievements away when each of them were, sometimes violently, fought for and only secured after <i>years</i>, sometimes <i>decades</i>, of effort. America has been very reliable in making people work very hard to gain equality.<p>> <i>It&#x27;s not like a plutocratic equivalent of &quot;robber barons&quot; did not exist prior, they were just aristocrats, and so their theft of capital from the lower classes was accepted as a social norm, a part of the &quot;social contract&quot;, if you will.</i><p>I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if you&#x27;ve studied much history at all. In what periods of modern history have aristocrats and &quot;their theft of capital from the lower classes&quot; been &quot;accepted as a social norm, a part of the &#x27;social contract&#x27;...&quot;? Definitely not much since the 17th century in many Western nations. And always shakily before then, requiring either a balancing act on behalf of the aristocrats, or blatant displays and threats of force to protect it. Even when it wasn&#x27;t subject to outright rebellion against its existence, it has always been a problem, and never been simply accepted.<p>> <i>If you look at economic indicators, you will find the numbers do not support your assertions. The best compiled data on this can be found in Schumpeter&#x27;s &quot;Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy&quot; - income inequality in the US was relatively static if not improving over this time period...</i><p>This is absolutely false.<p>There are a plethora of historians and economists one can read further to understand these historical trends--Claudia Goldin, Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez, Robert Margo, Simon Kuznets, Wojciech Kopczuk, Tony Judt, and many more. Until the interwar decades of the 20th century, income inequality was shown, as far back as a century, to have done little but rise. It&#x27;s not even a fact disputed by any serious economist or historian of the period.",1452934588

It sounds like in this comment and others further down-thread, that you&#x27;re suggesting there was not an increase in economic inequality prior to 1920. This is nonsense.<p>> <i>Prior to 1920 there was basically zero income tax, and it&#x27;s hard to argue that in the preceding era, especially 1850-1920, inequality was on the rise. Hell, one segment of the population OWNED another segment of the population.</i><p>First off, just in your chosen period of 1850-1920, slavery only existed for 15 of those 70 years. I don&#x27;t think it has anything at all to do with evaluating the state of income inequality in the period--except to have drastically increased its relative levels when the whole of enslaved Americans were made free and joined the ranks of the working masses. What happened after 1865 is an indisputably clear narrative of the newly recognized widening gulf between the wealthy and the masses, elevated to the national stage as a critically important civic conversation. Given the history of the post-Civil-War to pre-WWII era, it is really not difficult at all to argue that inequality was rising--and widely recognize as such. In fact, suggesting that it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> is almost laughably ignorant of the period&#x27;s history.<p>The increased wealth of pre- and early-industrial capitalists was widely acknowledged at the time to have deleterious effects on social, political, and economic spheres. It was overwhelmingly part of the national dialogue, and fed into the rise of populist movements, social and political agitation, establishment and positive public reception of unions among the working class, political campaigns, local political machinery manipulations, and so much more. The gulf that separated the wealthy from the masses between the Civil War and WWI was <i>a big fucking deal</i>. This inequality of economic conditions, and the resulting power imbalances, along with the ability to purchase and maneuver the state and national forces to protect capitalist interests led to riots in the streets, creation of new political parties, and overwhelmingly massive changes to the social, economic, and political landscape during this period.<p>I know of no historians of America since 1850-1950 who would, even in jest, suggest income inequality in the late-19th and early-20th century did anything but rise. The only exception to this widely recognized and documented state of affairs occurs after 1918--a notable decrease in the interwar period, a marked plummeting during WWII, a steadying greater equality in the post-war decades, until inequality began rising again in the 1970s. Hell, I&#x27;m actually amazed that anyone seriously disputes any of this. It&#x27;s American history 101--a constant, meandering power struggle between the wealthy and everyone else. This has been a staple of American political, social, and economic life since colonial times. We have, as a nation, had this argument before ... many times.",1452933622

This is a huge pain point again because while there are a lot of great websites there are a ton of shitty ones. This is pretty obvious if you look at sites like reddit or hacker news. They are developed around the idea of aggregating good resources because there are so many it is overwhelming.<p>So, I think, that of the 50% of the people that are already running googlebot, some subset will start probably using it to get info they care about.

You don&#x27;t think MIRI is the best vehicle for such funding - that&#x27;s understandable, although I&#x27;m semi-biased in their favor as they probably brought the most attention to this issue, and have been working on it for a long time. I assume that they have good reasons for the approaches they&#x27;re taking right now. But again, not believing in MIRI or in a foom event is totally compatible with still believing we should be doing something about this problem, so you and I are pretty closely in sync.<p>Having said that, I read through your notes, and I do have a major object. (You seem to understand more of the technical details than me, so take with a grain of salt).<p>I think your argument boils down to one main thing - that humans are pretty much &quot;efficient&quot; with respect to data usage already, because of evolution. If we take away that belief, then your reasons for thinking we can&#x27;t build an AI that&#x27;s superintelligent goes away - we <i>would</i> be able to squeeze more efficiency out of it.<p>So here&#x27;s the problem - I don&#x27;t understand <i>why</i> you believe that humans are data efficient. I understand the idea behind it, but it seemed to me like the only explanation for data efficiency is that evolution would&#x27;ve taken care of it. You even mention that the default argument agains this point is that eveolution might get stuck in local optimums, but it&#x27;s very hard to do better.<p>But there are 2 counterarguments to this:<p>1. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so much difficult to do better than evolution, since we do it regularly. We defeat diseases. We build machines that are faster/stronger/etc than anything evolution has &quot;come up with&quot;. Etc.<p>2. I don&#x27;t think evolution was &quot;optimizing&quot; for intelligence anyway. Our intelligence, however limited, is enough to become the most powerful species on the planet. Biology faces very hard trade-offs in squeezing more intelligence into us, but this isn&#x27;t true of digital equipment, which doesn&#x27;t have to be based on hardware that, e.g. has to be born, therefore has to squeeze through the birth canal, etc. These are limits that evolution was &quot;working under&quot;, but that we don&#x27;t have.<p>Note: All anthropomorphizing of evolution done figuratively.",1452932390

So calling out the death penalty metaphor was connected to my argument that people&#x27;s ethics reasoning acumen is not as lousy as the metaphor implies.<p>> I accuse the argument of &quot;veganism helps ecology&quot; the same way, which is a point you summoned first. People who advocate veganism probably do so for moral reasons, because if ecological sustainability were their motivating value, then veganism would probably be far down the list of problems and solutions [...]  if they wanted to be practical, they would argue for vegetarianism first<p>In my experience many people do argue for and practice vegetarianism first, and the studies & analyses I&#x27;ve seen indicate that vegetarianism/veganism are at the top of the list of effective and practical carbon footprint reduction solutions.
