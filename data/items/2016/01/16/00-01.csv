Doubly so because the entire history of their industry has been the exact opposite philosophy.<p>I have no doubt mobile chipsets contain a surprising amount of complexity. I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to be surprised by it! But I&#x27;ve only ever run across vague references to various improvements, which are worth just as much as saying &quot;Our code uses AES!&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s obviously easy to restrict a core to certain memory ranges. But how is that restriction <i>set</i>? Is it fixed in the mask (leading to inflexibility), or is it set through registers? The bullet point is enough to satisfy a PHB&#x27;s sense of security, but we know it&#x27;s the details of those loose ends where the exploits lie. And the threat model of Qualcomm is quite different from the threat model of a phone&#x27;s owner.<p>Simplistic points like the OP are really a symptom of this not knowing. Can you blame them for not knowing the <i>exact</i> vulnerability? It&#x27;s like someone picking on a binary blob, saying it can contain a backdoor password. Well, the industry having moved from backdoor passwords to challenge-response isn&#x27;t really a defense to the overriding point, is it?",1452905994

Guard against interblock attacks?<p>The crypto needs to be completely reworked.  This is an asymmetric kek around symmetric encryption, which is done in many other projects.<p>Half-backed crypto such as this is worse than no crypto at all, as it lulls people into believing they are using a valid cryptographic system.  But, the project implements (poorly) a subset of what is needed and pushes the rest into application code - but app writers don&#x27;t know this and wouldn&#x27;t know what to implement even if they know of the shortcomings.<p>Cryptographers see this all the time.  People think they invented a new concept but only implemented a well-known design but did it incompletely and with well-known flaws in the crypto.  Then, people defend the system, when it would be far easier to use better primitives.",1452905970

I think I was already fully agreeing with you, and suggesting the same but in softer language. Maybe you meant that for the parent or more generally the thread, but I think that I should add something: I may have unintentionally conflated the discussion on neural nets and the biological research my friend was talking about.<p>My limited understanding of what he said - and I&#x27;ll go ask him for a reference - is that we (as in scientists somewhere, not me personally) have come to a more or less clear and complete understanding of the chemical and electrical processes in the neural functioning of these simple life-forms, from top to bottom. (I don&#x27;t know that&#x27;s true, but that&#x27;s what I think I heard.) They then tried to put together a complete simulation of this simple lifeform&#x27;s neurons. This simulation, as I understand it, is not a neural network per se, but something trying to be much closer to a biological simulation. And when they turn it on, apparently, it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>That story, if true, tends to confirm what you said; we&#x27;re missing something in our understanding of biological neurons. Which, I think, lets me say more confidently that we can&#x27;t suggest we have the building blocks for AI yet.",1452905959

This desktop processing goes very underappreciated by most onlookers. Imagine if you couldn&#x27;t run a BitTorrent client on a home PC? To put it mildly, I would have an issue calling BitTorrent &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; in that case. For example, it would be absurd to out-and-out need a remote compute cluster to seed or leech torrents.<p>> And what year would 32MB blocks be needed in and what processors would be available in that year?<p>The &quot;big blockist&quot; proponents actually contended Bitcoin dies without 20MB blocks starting this month, January 2016, and doubling every two years. Going by their original propositions, we would have >32MB block capacity by around this time in 2018. How much do you think desktop PC performance will have improved by then? And this is to say nothing of the bandwidth costs [1].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/bandwidth-usage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://statoshi.info/dashboard/db/bandwidth-usage</a>",1452905337

10913476,comment,10912880,10912880,0,0,graycat,,,"Yes, for government to confiscate private property without due process is a bummer, an outrageous violation of our Constitutional rights.  No doubt about that. In particular, that the police believe that someone is acting <i>suspiciously</i> is nothing like justification for such confiscation.<p>Yes, there have long been news articles on this civil forfeiture scam.  No doubt it happens.  But have to suspect that it doesn&#x27;t happen very often to innocent people.  Why so suspect?  Because there would be more screaming, political debates, SCOTUS cases, etc.<p>In a sense, that there can be such a scam is not too surprising:  That is, as we know well, generally, &quot;The price of liberty is eternal vigilance&quot;.  So, we can expect attacks on our Constitutional rights, and, to get our rights back or just maintain them, we have to fight, continually.  That is, there are plenty of people who will take our rights unless we do fight back.  So, right along, there needs to be fighting back.<p>Where is the ACLU in all of this?  What about other groups interested in keeping government under control?<p>We can fight back by bringing law suits and by voting.<p>But, in particular, and in practical terms, in a local community, likely it can be enough to be known and respected in the community, active in politics, well known to the local politicians, and to have a little chat with them.  A respected local citizen will likely not get pushed around by the police.  It&#x27;s a little like high school -- it helps to fit in at least a little.<p>Broadly an immediate, expedient, practical solution is:  In public, don&#x27;t carry  a lot of cash.  If have a lot of cash in your house, then, in case your house gets searched, have that cash well hidden.  If you have a business that gets paid in cash, say, some tens of thousands a month, maybe make a daily deposit to your business account.  Then, get well known at your bank as a successful, local business person who does get revenue in cash -- hopefully then your bank won&#x27;t file papers saying that you are <i>suspicious</i>.  E.g., generally in business, a banker wants good business customers, and business person wants good respect from their banker.<p>Commonly in a small community, the police know a lot of the people.  That can help, say, if at 3 AM drive to the post office to deposit a letter -- the local police will just remember who you are and relax.<p>It might help to make a donation to some local police charity drive and, there, shake hands with the local chief of police.  Maybe can get a window sticker for your car indicating that you are such a supporter.<p>Likely if there are enough legal cases where citizens bring suit against civil forfeiture, the practice will reach the SCOTUS and get struck down.  Of course, legal cases are very expensive, but there are a lot of law school graduates without much to do; with enough forfeiture cases, some of those lawyers would take such cases and change the situation.<p>For long distance travel, there is an old saying, &quot;A stranger in a strange land&quot;.  So, it has long been recognized that being such a stranger is not the usual but has some dangers.  E.g., don&#x27;t carry much cash or anything very valuable.  E.g., if want to carry $15,000 to buy a used car, just go to a bank and get a certified check for that amount and hide it somewhere, maybe in a book, fold it up and put it between two credit cards in your wallet, or just mail it to yourself at your destination.  Some of the police might say that anyone who didn&#x27;t use such a technique is suspicious.",1452904638

A 1996 Supreme Court decision ruled that prosecuting a person for a crime and seizing his or her property via civil forfeiture did not constitute double jeopardy, and therefore did not violate the Constitution. However, in 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that civil forfeiture was not permitted if the amount seized was &quot;grossly disproportional&quot; to the gravity of the offense.&quot;<p>It seems the current legal interpretations do not support considering double-dipping like this to be unconstitutional.

My organization offers co-location and hosting services to a variety of open source projects. You can think of us as sysadmin to the open source community. And for all the talk about funding developer time, discussion about the operations side is notoriously quiet. There&#x27;s a few good actors that help us out, and we&#x27;re trying to raise awareness of the issue.<p>Within our org, we try to contribute to open source as we go, and we have a software development team, but we&#x27;re not paying people to write software for specific external projects. AFAIK, nobody is demotivated by our existence. You just don&#x27;t see a lot of volunteers to get paged in the middle of the night when the website is down.<p>The open source software we fund development of is largely to suit our operations team needs. They&#x27;re not the sort of software projects you&#x27;d expect people to volunteer for, which is why we allocated student developers to start them. It&#x27;s hard to separate the compensation effects on volunteers from the general &#x27;I don&#x27;t run this software&#x27; effects, and since we didn&#x27;t inject money into existing projects, there&#x27;s no debates about the inequity.<p>There&#x27;s another unstated funding challenge: if you want to maximize value your money brings to open source, you want to find someone who can escalate their contribution. If you assume the Steve Hansons of OSS are already spending all their time contributing, handing them money supports the status quo, but handing money to students who would otherwise be flipping burgers brings new faces, and additional effort to projects. In a sense, it matters whether your charitable goal is to reward lifetime contributions, or to gift the community better software, and in small ways these can be contradictory. Especially if continued funding relies on demonstrating return on the gifts, merely perpetuating the status quo is a problem.<p>> I&#x27;d also be interested in how you&#x27;d feel having a donation of skilled engineer 20% time compared to money to hire someone less experienced but full-time.<p>So our model is to hire student employees. They&#x27;re cheap, and we can be flexible around their schedules in ways other potential employers cannot. We participate in GSoC, and are open to contributions, but generally speaking what we develop is not relevant for home use. On the operations side of things, we participate in the Chef ecosystem, but there&#x27;s a level of access and such that open source infra teams prefer to control access to.

10913314,comment,10910887,10912959,0,0,dahart,,,"> Simulating a human brain is perhaps necessary for consciousness uploading, but not for super human ai.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting otherwise, and what you said might be true, I don&#x27;t know. But honest question: how can we know it&#x27;s true before we can do either? How can we suggest neural nets are a good building block of super human AI, if we can&#x27;t verify we can do regular human thinking, or sub-human thinking?<p>Because the neural net is modeled after (simplified) brain neurons in the first place, it seems reasonable to suggest that if we can&#x27;t simulate a simple brain, then we can&#x27;t validate that the model is correct, right? It might be very productive, and it might &#x27;work&#x27; in some sense, but we don&#x27;t know whether it can truly act as the lego brick of brain building material until we can build a functional brain.<p>Your observation is true, and worth considering. Machines can travel faster than humans, <i>but</i> that&#x27;s different in part because we didn&#x27;t start trying to simulate the human foot, right? The computational equivalent would be that machines can multiply a lot of numbers much faster than a human. That is super-human calculation, and it is mechanical thinking, of a sort, but most people wouldn&#x27;t say it counts as &quot;AI&quot;, perhaps the same way that most people wouldn&#x27;t say a car counts as human running, even if it is faster.<p>Neural nets are being used to classify images, find objects, identify people&#x27;s faces in a crowd or in difficult to see situations. But, they currently can&#x27;t tell you to stop classifying images because you&#x27;re asking the wrong question, or interrupt you to say you&#x27;re looking great today.",1452902734

For example, are records of every instance of a civil forfeiture publicly available?  Would it be helpful (and ethical) to publish this list to shine a bright spotlight on the practice?  Would that make a difference?<p>It also raises the age-old question of &quot;who polices the police?&quot;  The (federal) DOJ can only do so much, it seems.  But maybe ordinary citizens can demand reform if injustice stares them in the face?<p>From what I&#x27;ve read in the press (especially NyTimes), the USA justice system seems to fundamentally disadvantage poor people [1].  The saddest part about the civil forfeiture business is that it probably affects the poorest people, who then have the least resources to challenge it.<p>On a separate note, I know the press is more likely to publish instances of injustice vs run-of-the-mill &quot;just&quot; justice.

But the concept of &quot;externalities&quot; only applies because the game of acquisition is loaded in ways that - literally - doesn&#x27;t account for social and environmental damage.<p>There would be much less inequality, and much less pollution, if the effects of both were costed accurately.<p>Free-marketers always argue that there would be much less innovation too. I think that&#x27;s nonsense. You maximise growth by lowering the cost of entry to new markets as far as it will go, and making business-building as attractive as you can make it to anyone who has a service or product to offer.<p>Traditionally this is rationed by very limited access to capital. In an innovation economy, with more equality, much wider access to capital would not only increase economic participation for most of the population, it would also make entrepreneurial activity a lot more possible.<p>This is the opposite of the current model, where you can only access capital by being born into the oligarchy, or being persuasive enough to talk your way into it past the gatekeepers, or - much too rarely - having the talent and energy to bootstrap a successful business from a cold start.<p>Inequality is a form of rationing.

By funding services exclusively, VCs have been actively pushing the adoption of services to the detriment of open source... For example, instead of encouraging startups to run their own open source database engine (which is quite feasible), startups may be tempted to use a hosted database-as-a-service instead (because it was advertised to them). Instead of using an open source CMS and host it themselves, they will use a hosted as-a-service solution (even though it&#x27;s more expensive and often doesn&#x27;t make sense for this startup economically). Instead of doing their own performance monitoring for their app (using an open source tool), they will use a service instead.<p>Not so long ago, the &#x27;as-a-service&#x27; companies which did well were the ones which had roots in open source and actually did a lot of OSS work themselves (E.g. Wordpress, Red Hat). Now you have a lot of as-a-service startups which came out of nowhere, raised a boatload of VC funding and are stealing all the limelight away from smaller OSS (pioneering) projects who have been working towards a specific vision for many years.",1452902535
