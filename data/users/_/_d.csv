adsmoke,1,"It has been said that online display advertising is 5 times as effective as text based advertising and rich media (video) advertising is 8 times as effective as display. Thus, rich media ads can be up to 40 times as effective as text ads.<p>As television viewers are spending less time watching television and more time on the Internet, advertisers need an effective way to retain their target audiences. In addition, publishers of video content need an efficient way to earn revenue.<p>AdSmoke was founded by 4 ex-Yahoo! business development and technology employees.<p>AdSmoke was born out of the desire to help web site owners monetize their embedded Youtube inventory and to help advertisers with low cost video ad distribution.<p>Visit us at: http://adsmoke.com",1301767819,1452893181

adsyme,1,"With a strong background in advertising & communication, back in 2001, Frdrick designed the very first european magazine fully dedicated to mobile entertainment services (when logos where B&W and ringtones...monophonic), SMSMAG, distributed via street marketing teams in BE, FR & UK, which generated 4M+ mobile downloads. He also developed an innovative B2B service dedicated to the real time correction of wrongly spelled logos & ringtones requests, which was used by the main EU players in the early days of mobile entertainment. The platform evolved to become the first mobile contact centre, handling a variety of txt-based requests. This gave birth to the SMSCASH concept in late 2005, the first txt-based consumer loan service, sold to Laser Cofinoga (FR) in July 2006 after grossing 15M euro of loans production. Having completed those two mobile/internet ventures, Frdrick invested as an active business partner / VC in a spin-off of ATC Management (London), managing the careers of The Boxer Rebellion / The Staves / Fink / Ethan Johns. He is still very active on the indie scene, occasionally promoting concerts in Belgium and in London. He also runs a boutique label (Les Disques Modernes), which signed two Belgian bands and released in the UK the album of an iconic Belgian act (Ks Choice). In october 2010 he co-promoted the Belgian edition of the European Japan Anime Live tour (arena manga & anime show). In 2011 he realized his childhood dream by writing & producing his first family circus show, Le Rve dIgor by Le Cirque Moderne, which was staged in two different versions for more than 150 performances in 2011 and 2012. In 2013, Frdrick is back to the mobile scene with an exciting disruptive venture: adsy.me, the first mobile web app enabling anyone to create & share beautiful mobile apps on the go.",1382274764,1450207814

I&#x27;ve been close to fluent in: APL, Basic, Z80/8080, Fortran, Algol-68, PL/1, Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, VAX Lisp, BLISS, MACRO-32, C, and Scheme.  I worked for DEC for eight years on the VMS operating system (TCSEC C2/B1), for TGV and then Cisco, was one of the founders of Network Alchemy, and (nominally) a CTO at Nokia after they bought Network Alchemy.<p>I designed the security auditing subsystem in VMS, was one of the designers of IKE and IPsec, and I designed the IKE over GSSAPI over Kerberos authentication mode that Windows NT uses.  Since 2010, I&#x27;ve been studying Italian and Thai and failing to learn Haskell.  I keep returning to Lisp and Chicken Scheme.  I like Swift, it&#x27;s nicely pragmatic.<p>I&#x27;m pretty skeptical of social media&#x27;s value and I think a lot of Y Combinator startups lack any viable value proposition.  I&#x27;m pretty grumpy about the state of the software industry in general and I am incensed about Silicon Valley&#x27;s cooperation with the NSA since 2001.<p>I believe passionately in privacy and fear my government because my mom grew up in Bavaria during WWII.

We are experts in Web and Mobile, and love working on new and interesting projects, so check us out: www.PurpleBit.com.<p>My History: I started off as a programmer, worked for around 6 years as an embedded systems programmer, then started my first startup. Several startup attempts later, my 2 brilliant co-founders and I decided the startup game isn&#x27;t where we want to be, so we switched to building our Software Consultancy.<p>If you want to get in touch for any reason, feel absolutely free to talk to me: edan@purplebit.com. I love talking with anyone on HN.<p>People I pay attention to on HN:<p>pg\npatio11\ntptacek\ngrellas<p>Many others, but can&#x27;t remember all the names right now.<p>View more info about me at: http://www.hackernewsers.com/users/edanm.html",1268296251,1452884620

But following that advice, AmericaSpace has evolved into a space news outlet with 15 very talented people. It is they who make it hum and have through their hard work built viewership to 60K unique visits monthly.<p>I am the founder and co-organizer of CocoaCoder.org, a group founded in 2003 to promote Mac OS X, and later iOS, application development. It has over 420 members. CocoaCoder.org meets weekly and presents on both hard and soft topics.<p>In 2000-2001, I worked at JPL, Section 312 as a C++ programmer.

mdasen,7622,"""Just as most issues are seldom black or white, so are most good solutions seldom black or white.  Beware of the solution that requires one side to be totally the loser and the other side to be totally the winner.  The reason there are two sides to begin with usually is because neither side has all the facts.  Therefore, when the wise mediator effects a compromise, he is not acting from political motivation.  Rather, he is acting from a deep sense of respect for the whole truth.""<p>~Stephen R. Schwambach",1207244346,1452501379

pdkl95,4112,"&quot;PDKL 95&quot;<p>1. (noun) - The drug used by the Superbrights as a means of forwarding Cataclyst[1] ideology. At high doses, the drug erases all sense of &quot;self&quot;, but can be used at low doses to force a change in perspective by violently disrupting the mind&#x27;s established, &quot;normal&quot; way of interpreting reality.<p>2. (noun) - The most efficient (and dangerously destructive) means of breaking out an established paradigm, into a different Prigoginic[2] Level of Complexity.<p>3. (name) - The internet alias of an insane nerd in the San Francisco Bay Area. A UNIX and Free Software advocate, who has been programming from a very young age.

rdipasup,3,"Hello Paul Graham & Y Combinator. My name is Ray Dipasupil & I was born here in the U.S. but grew up in the Philippines. As a child, I grew up as a Yamaha classically trained pianist & have always been passionate about cars. I majored in economics & accounting in Loyola Marymount University but began programming in high school. The programming languages I'm on are  JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, & jQuery but started dabbling in the server side of PHP & Node.JS. During the little time I have, I moonlight as a hobbyist cook & have a deep admiration for Chef Gordon Ramsay's tenacity & determination in getting things done. I'm also perpetually curious about other fields & the current book I'm reading right now is Ray Kurzweil's How to Create a Mind - The Secret of Human Thought Revealed & Walter Isaacson's biography, Einstein - His Life & Universe.<p>I founded StanceTrader, which is a peer-to-peer eCommerce marketplace for car parts catering to hot rodders and gearheads alike. My team & I believe we can provide a meaningful impact to the hot rodding community by delivering a seamless & easy-to-use platform that's focused on the gearhead. We have many more ideas up on our sleeves that we would eventually integrate on how to make StanceTrader a one-stop shop for many gearheads & general automotive enthusiasts & we believe Y Combinator can help us scale and achieve our long-term goals. As a child, I've always been enamored about all things automobiles & started modifying my first car before I even learned to drive. Throughout the years, my team & I analyzed & tested many car parts that made our budget buckets run faster, look better, & be more fuel efficient than OEM. I think I have this opportunity with my team to make it all happen as far & wide as we can see.<p>I'm blessed to have this opportunity to apply my company, StanceTrader, to Y Combinator & we eagerly look forward in hearing back from you. Thank you, Paul Graham & Y Combinator.",1337974737,1450207814
