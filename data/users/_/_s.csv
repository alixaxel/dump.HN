In fact, it was partially because of you folks that my two friends and I formed a startup in 2008. Three rounds of funding, innumerable mistakes, and 5 years later, we started our second venture http://www.codecombat.com and got accepted to to the YC W14 batch on stage at Startup School 2013.<p>I stopped working on CodeCombat in early 2015 and am working at a real estate startup in SF.<p>Personally, I enjoy downhill skiing, talking about cars and computers, working with my hands, blogging, and music videos. Although I wasn&#x27;t a computer science major, I&#x27;ve built two products from the ground up with the help of my two cofounders.

jsherman76,3,"I began my journey during the dot-com boom of the 90s when I started my own Technology Consulting company after graduating Delaware Valley University with a degree in Computer Information Systems Management in 1998. I was recently flown out to Google HQ for a Lead Program Manager Developer Relations Ecosystem role (I was told I had Googleyness). Currently, I am the CEO & Co-founder for Instamour, an innovative mobile video messaging platform based out of Philadelphia. We also built a B2B version called See2B and are in private beta. I am in the middle of filming a historical Documentary about Northeast Philadelphia as well as the preservation of historic buildings in Philadelphia. You can watch me on FOX Saturday mornings at 10am EST (also on Hulu) speaking on a show called Xploration Earth 2050. I am an avid volunteer for the Philadelphia tech community as a videographer and photographer for Philly New Technology Meetup, StartupGrind (Google Entrepreneurs), and Tech in Motion Events. As a contributor for Technically Philly, I write about the thriving Philadelphia tech scene with a focus on startups. I also write entrepreneurial articles about technology, lean methodology, and the future on my news site Area Tech 51. I mentor other tech startups, college students and business owners on how to succeed using lean methodology. I created a How To Video Series hosted on Youtube. Also, I&#x27;m an avid supporter of virtual currency such as Bitcoin and have created a microsite to teach others and spread awareness. I am a drone (DJI Phantom 3 and Inspire 1) enthusiast, and run VideoDrone.me which is my aerial cinematography subdivision of DelphiaFilms.com, my film production company.",1394994291,1450384166

From 1998-2011, I worked in the Algorithms group at Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs (MERL), where my job title was &quot;distinguished research scientist.&quot; The focus of my work was probabilistic inference algorithms, and their applications in communications, signal processing, and AI.<p>I worked at Viaweb (which is relevant to Hacker News because that&#x27;s the company Paul Graham co-founded) for one year before joining MERL in 1998. Before that, I was a professional chess player and teacher, and before that I was a theoretical physicist.<p>You can learn more about me and my interests at my (now inactive) blog at http://nerdwisdom.com.",1190409198,1448561729
