I learned about HN from a post by Mark Zuckerberg.<p>About me I am disabled, but web enabled, You can see more about that at http://Chambers.PW or below. I designed a feeding tube coffee cup and wish to have it funded at some point and put in the market. It allows people who use feeding tubes to &quot;eat&quot; in social arenas without being self-conscience or making others uncomfortable. p37307@p37307.com<p>My Google Shopping Shortlist to: https://www.google.com/shopping/shortlists/l/a11661987450066619618 I guess if there can be gift registries for births, weddings, etc, there can be one for sickness.<p>My Bitcoin address is 1Pn474TokcXYstkkigm6WzdSm2gr24wRQd<p>I suffer from Parkinson&#x27;s Plus Syndrome.

Even though I don&#x27;t have Multiple Sclerosis per say, I have demyelination as a secondary whammy, I stay connected with the MS community because for several years my probable DX was MS (Significant demyelination was the first concrete neuro finding) then all the other issues, autonomic dysfunction, etc, started.<p>About my Posts: I normally post to my circles and followers. However, please feel free to reshare to your circles if a posts pops out at you or moves you. Over at Facebook, I got a lot of spam comments and private messages on some posts. I assume that will change now that they charge $1.00 per private message.<p>Please note my grammar has taken a beaten with the onslaught of my PPS. Please note I may edit my posts, comments, etc from time to time to correct these issues. As a former newspaper editor, starting out as a proofreader and copyeditor, this is a silent side effect of this illness for me. Don&#x27;t hesitate to private post me with a link to my post if you have suggested or corrections with my writing. Really. You can be my pseudo language therapist.<p>Paul Chambers has a rare form of Parkinson&#x27;s called Parkinson&#x27;s Plus Syndrome. As a result, certain autonomic functions are limited. Included in these are blood pressure and pulse, autonomic swallowing functions, requiring him to be permanently feed via a feeding tube for all food and most liquids, mobility and gait issue. Spasticity is a major problem too and heat sensitivity. I have a Baclofen Pump to better regulate his muscles. www.baclofenpump.com.

palish,6552,"=======<p>To whomever that has read upto here: you hereby implicitly agree my EULA, in which you swear to enjoy each of your scientific pursuits with intensity and to your fullest degree; and sometimes even to a dangerous degree, if the mood carries you thus. Additionally, you agree to never allow an employer, family member, or any other authority to break your intrinsic spirit; for they have no means of dominating your spirit except that which you subconsciously allow them. You shall be true to yourself and to your own principles, regardless of society (though in privacy). You shall hereby refuse to believe any scientific statement as ""true"", however benign, except those in which you alone have proven to yourself to be true, by your own hand and evidence. (Though it doesn't hurt to check out what other people have to say on the subject, from time to time; in fact, it turns out to often be a more valuable course of action, for the careful analysis of a close friend can often reveal subtle flaws in your process and in your logic, while occasionally forcing you to re-evaluate your core reasoning for choosing that process in the first place, which always leads to the path of learning and thus improvement and satisfaction.) You agree to eventually die with no regrets. Let no one impose themselves upon your judgement without merit. You shall endeavor to enjoy life to the fullest extent of the law (where applicable), and to realize that money is merely a means, not an end unto itself. In your spare time, you shall research that which is impossible, but intriguing, in order to always have something to strive for, thereby improving your skill and your spirit. You shall follow your curiosity wherever it leads (but keep both eyes open for signs of danger).<p>Most importantly: thou shalt enjoy every week, else thou shalt fix your life's situation regardless of how immutable it may seem.<p>=======",1172011682,1172011682

pdkl95,4112,"&quot;PDKL 95&quot;<p>1. (noun) - The drug used by the Superbrights as a means of forwarding Cataclyst[1] ideology. At high doses, the drug erases all sense of &quot;self&quot;, but can be used at low doses to force a change in perspective by violently disrupting the mind&#x27;s established, &quot;normal&quot; way of interpreting reality.<p>2. (noun) - The most efficient (and dangerously destructive) means of breaking out an established paradigm, into a different Prigoginic[2] Level of Complexity.<p>3. (name) - The internet alias of an insane nerd in the San Francisco Bay Area. A UNIX and Free Software advocate, who has been programming from a very young age. Expect a strange mix of very-traditional UNIX philosophy and technique, mixed with seemingly random or surreal tangents.<p>[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schismatrix#Ideologies<p>[2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Prigogine",1376134630,1452899068

We&#x27;re Nylas and we&#x27;re looking for help building the next generation email platform. We&#x27;re building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend application engineers, designers, backend systems engineers and infrastructure/operations engineers to join us.<p>Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now. We have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. We&#x27;re scaling heavily and if you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years. Yet have you ever met anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that. We&#x27;re building a frontend framework to power the next generation of mail apps. Sound exciting to you?<p>== We&#x27;re particularly looking for folks who ==\n* Take personal pride in their work and value autonomy and ownership\n* Want the chance to step up and lead a team\n* Put the work before ego. We&#x27;ve got each others&#x27; backs, and we want you to be with us on that<p>== A bit more about us ==\n* Our backend is built on Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian. We&#x27;ve been careful to keep our architecture componentized\n* Our frontend projects use Coffeescript, React, Flux, SQL for offline caching, Electron (Atom Shell), and no jQuery\n* Tons of our code is open source. Check it out: https://github.com/nylas\n* We&#x27;re a team of 15 (12 engineers)\n* We have a paid vacation policy & value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, & lunch at the office every day. Some remote work / work-from-home is OK too<p>Apply at https://nylas.com/jobs or ping me directly (spang at nylas dot com). I&#x27;m Christine, one of our co-founders. We&#x27;re a diverse team, and encourage applications from all backgrounds.",1441129911,1453171997

possiblemat,188,"10 My life as a programmer began with GWBasic.<p>After an unfortunate journey taking me through the restricted lands of Pacal, Delphi, VB, Java, C++, C#, I finally discovered Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Going from not knowing Ruby to knowing Ruby was for me a revelation of roughly the same order of magnitude as discovering programming. I discovered Git at about the same time I started working with Ruby professionally, and had the same kind of revelation about source control. Needless to say, both tools are now the underpinnings of most of the things I undertake programmatically.<p>I can be observed in the wild, sometimes going under the name of webmat. I ramble about software development (web and mobile), life as a developer and open source tools at programblings.com.\nI am the author of git_remote_branch, a free and open source tool that helps mere mortals like me trivially manipulate git branches published in shared repositories.",1177928999,1422391033

My background is in industrial design, so I'm not your typical founder, but I think what POWERleap does is important and can change the world. \nI've already been in forbes, fast company, NYTimes, and on the Discovery Channel and Sundance Channel. My work has reached the eyes of people in over 50 countries. I'm ready to turn this inspiring technology into a profit generating solution!<p>In my spare time I like to bike long distances, run weird races, hike, chat, make things, cook for people, and learn how to surf (although I just got my first board to the face- chin gash, swollen face, and all).",1350510004,1450207814
